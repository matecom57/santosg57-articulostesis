    "abstract": "Important adolescents' career-related decisions might be influenced by their beliefs about malleability of intelligence and learning (mindset). We combined quantitative and qualitative data to provide in-depth insights in the beliefs that 13-14-year-olds hold about learning and intelligence, the factors influencing these beliefs, and the consequences of these beliefs in relation to classroom behaviour and study choices. To establish students' mindsets quantitatively, we categorised theory of intelligence questionnaire (TOI; Dweck, 1999) averaged scores into three levels: entity, intermediate or incremental mindsets, to provide insight into the distribution of the different mindset types in our sample (N = 492). The results of this quantitative study show that more than half of the students believed intelligence is \"fixed\" (entity mindset), these data showed no effect of gender. To gain more in-depth insight in the views of these students, focus groups about mindset and its influences and consequences were held in a subsample (n = 176). The qualitative data provide more nuanced insights, for example they reveal subtle gender differences regarding effort beliefs and motivation. Integrated discussion of the quantitative and qualitative results demonstrates that this multi-method approach reflects the complexity of the concept mindset better than only the widely used TOI questionnaire.",

    "abstract": "Current standard protocols used in the clinic for diagnosing COVID-19 include molecular or antigen tests, generally complemented by a plain chest X-Ray. The combined analysis aims to reduce the significant number of false negatives of these tests and provide complementary evidence about the presence and severity of the disease. However, the procedure is not free of errors, and the interpretation of the chest X-Ray is only restricted to radiologists due to its complexity. With the long term goal to provide new evidence for the diagnosis, this paper presents an evaluation of different methods based on a deep neural network. These are the first steps to develop an automatic COVID-19 diagnosis tool using chest X-Ray images to differentiate between controls, pneumonia, or COVID-19 groups. The paper describes the process followed to train a Convolutional Neural Network with a dataset of more than 79, 500 X-Ray images compiled from different sources, including more than 8, 500 COVID-19 examples. Three different experiments following three preprocessing schemes are carried out to evaluate and compare the developed models. The aim is to evaluate how preprocessing the data affects the results and improves its explainability. Likewise, a critical analysis of different variability issues that might compromise the system and its effects is performed. With the employed methodology, a 91.5% classification accuracy is obtained, with an 87.4% average recall for the worst but most explainable experiment, which requires a previous automatic segmentation of the lung region.",

    "abstract": "Pathology plays a very important role in cancer diagnosis. The rapid development of digital pathology (DP) based on whole slide image (WSI) has led to many improvements in computer-assisted diagnosis by artificial intelligence. The common digitization strategy is to scan the pathology slice with 20\u00d7 or 40\u00d7 objective, and the 40\u00d7 objective requires excessive storage space and transmission time, which are significant negative factors in the popularization of DP. In this article, we present a novel reconstructed high-resolution (HR) process based on deep learning to switch 20 \u00d7 WSI to 40 \u00d7 without the loss of whole and local features. Furthermore, we collected the WSI data of 100 uterine leiomyosarcomas and 100 adult granulosa cell tumors to test our reconstructed HR process. We tested the reconstructed HR WSI by the peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, and the blind/reject image spatial quality evaluator, which were 42.03, 0.99, and 49.22, respectively. Subsequently, we confirmed the consistency between the actual and our reconstructed HR images. The testing results indicate that the reconstructed HR imaging is a reliable method for the digital slides of a variety of tumors and can be available on a large scale in clinical pathology as an innovative technique.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms govern in subtle yet fundamental ways the way we live and are transforming our societies. The promise of efficient, low-cost, or \"neutral\" solutions harnessing the potential of big data has led public bodies to adopt algorithmic systems in the provision of public services. As AI algorithms have permeated high-stakes aspects of our public existence-from hiring and education decisions to the governmental use of enforcement powers (policing) or liberty-restricting decisions (bail and sentencing)-this necessarily raises important accountability questions: What accountability challenges do AI algorithmic systems bring with them, and how can we safeguard accountability in algorithmic decision-making? Drawing on a decidedly public administration perspective, and given the current challenges that have thus far become manifest in the field, we critically reflect on and map out in a conceptually guided manner the implications of these systems, and the limitations they pose, for public accountability.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has developed quickly in recent years, with applications expanding from automatic driving and smart manufacturing to personal healthcare and algorithm-based social media utilization. During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI has played an essential role in identifying suspected infections, ensuring epidemic surveillance and quickening drug screening. However, many questions accompanied AI's development. How to protect citizens' privacy and national information security? What measures can help AI learn and practice good human behaviors and avoid unethical use of AI technologies? To answer these questions, Nation Science Review (NSR) interviewed Yi Zeng, Professor and Deputy Director at the Research Center for Brain-inspired Artificial Intelligence at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). He is a board member for the National Governance Committee of Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence affiliated to the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (MOST). Zeng is also in AI ethics expert groups at the World Health Organization and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). He jointly led the drafting of Beijing AI Principles (2019) and the National Governance Principles of New Generation AI of China (GPNGAI, 2019).",

    "abstract": "This study explores Intrapersonal Emotional Intelligence (IEI) with the objectives of: (1) analyzing possible differences due to sex and age, and the request for psychological assistance for behavioral and emotional problems; (2) finding evidence of personality traits, social behaviors, and parental socialization styles that are characteristic of adolescents with low IEI; and (3) identifying variables that predict high IEI. The sample comprised 2283 participants aged 12-17 years from the Basque Country (northern Spain). Results: (1) Females had greater emotional attention capacity but there were no sex differences in emotional comprehension and emotion regulation; (2) adolescents aged 12-14 showed higher scores in comprehension and emotion regulation than those aged 15-17; (3) adolescents who consulted a psychologist for problems (anxiety, depression, violence, etc.) had lower emotion regulation; (4) adolescents with low IEI had less empathy, self-esteem, extroversion, openness, agreeableness, and responsibility, and lower use of cooperative and passive conflict-resolution strategies, and their parents had a low level of acceptance-affection towards their children. They also engaged in more bullying/cyberbullying and antisocial behaviors. (5) High IEI predictor variables were: using cooperative conflict-resolution strategies; traits such as extroversion, responsibility, openness, and empathy; and a high level of maternal acceptance-affection. The work identifies relevant variables for designing intervention programs and shows the importance of promoting IEI and interpersonal emotional intelligence as a factor in the development and prevention of bullying/cyberbullying.",

    "abstract": "An analysis of secondary students' personality traits, along with a description of their emotional intelligence levels and their anger control, could be decisive when educating students to prevent anti-social behavior in academia. Very few studies on personality, emotional intelligence, and aggressive conduct exist in Spain. Some of the studies that do exist, however, only explore the relationship between emotional intelligence, personality, and prosocial behavior in secondary education students. Likewise, there are few studies focusing on personality and aggression control. In this study, using the Big Five personality models as predictors of aggressiveness in subjects and of emotional intelligence, we sought to contribute to the improvement of the education of students on aggressive behavior in education centers. To do this, we conducted a study using the Big Five Personality Questionnaire (BFQ) for Children and Adults (BFQ-NA), the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24) emotional intelligence test, and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) anger management test. Our main objective was to analyze the relationship of the BFQ with the variables of emotional intelligence and aggressiveness. This was achieved using a range of bivariate correlation and multiple regression tests. The results showed the correlation and predictive value of emotional intelligence and aggression in the Big Five model of personality. This study coincides with other research linking Big Five questionnaires with emotional intelligence and aggression.",

    "abstract": "The healthcare sector is considered to be one of the largest and fast-growing industries in the world. Innovations and novel approaches have always remained the prime aims in order to bring massive development. Before the emergence of technology, the healthcare sector was dependent on manpower, which was time-consuming and less accurate with lack of efficiency. With the recent advancements in machine learning, the condition has been steadily revolutionizing. Artificial intelligence (AI) lies in the computer science department, which stresses on the intelligent machines' creation, that work and react just like human beings. Currently, the applications of AI have been expanding into those fields, which was once thought to be the only domain of human expertise such as healthcare sector. In this review, we have shed light on the present usage of AI in the healthcare sector, such as its working, and the way this system is being implemented in different domains, such as drug discovery, diagnosis of diseases, clinical trials, remote patient monitoring, and nanotechnology. We have also briefly touched upon its applications in other sectors as well. The public opinions have also been analyzed and discussed along with the future prospects. We have discussed the merits, and the other side of AI, i.e. the disadvantages in the last part of the manuscript.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to reveal the relationship of meditation with emotional intelligence (EI), sleep quality and melatonin level.\nA cross-sectional study.\nOur current research was performed on middle-aged women. EI scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and night-time saliva melatonin were measured for 65 participants including 33 meditators and 32 controls.\nThe meditation group showed a significantly higher EI score than the control group. In the regression analysis between EI and age, only the meditation group showed a significant positive correlation. The Pearson correlation analysis among all participants revealed a significant negative correlation between PSQI and EI. There was no significant group difference in the melatonin and PSQI.",

Two hundred and one nurses and 201 caregivers of children hospitalized in a paediatric hospital in Tehran were randomly selected as participants. Data were analysed by SPSS. The data were collected in 2019.\nComparison of the subscale \"ethical intelligence\" with the scale \"quality of work life\" indicated a significant positive correlation between \"honesty\" with \"job and carrier satisfaction\" and \"forgiveness\" with \"job and carrier satisfaction\". In addition, findings showed a significant positive correlation between \"honesty\" and \"control at work\" and between \"accountability\" with \"home-work interface.\" There was no significant correlation between \"ethical intelligence\" and \"caring behaviours\" and between nurses' \"quality of work life\" and \"caring behaviours.\" Structural equation modelling showed a correlation between nurses' \"ethical intelligence\" and \"quality of work life.\"",

    "abstract": "We report on a novel curriculum (Scholarly Excellence, Leadership Experiences, Collaborative Training [SELECT]) in an allopathic medical school designed to prepare students to be physician leaders while remaining empathetic by combating burnout. SELECT students were surveyed annually. The survey contained the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). In this cohort, empathy did not decrease, as measured by the JSE, and SELECT students' MBI Depersonalization burnout scores decreased after year 3. In summary, in this allopathic US medical school utilizing a novel curriculum, there was no significant decline in empathy after the third year of medical school. The SELECT program appears to mitigate the decline in empathy and increased Depersonalization burnout levels often seen at the end of the third year of medical school.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to transform the health system, yet little research to date has explored its influence on nurses-the largest group of health professionals. Furthermore, there has been little discussion on how AI will influence the experience of person-centered compassionate care for patients, families, and caregivers.\nThis review aims to summarize the extant literature on the emerging trends in health technologies powered by AI and their implications on the following domains of nursing: administration, clinical practice, policy, and research. This review summarizes the findings from 3 research questions, examining how these emerging trends might influence the roles and functions of nurses and compassionate nursing care over the next 10 years and beyond.\nUsing an established scoping review methodology, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central, Education Resources Information Center, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest databases were searched. In addition to the electronic database searches, a targeted website search was performed to access relevant gray literature. Abstracts and full-text studies were independently screened by 2 reviewers using prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included articles focused on nursing and digital health technologies that incorporate AI. Data were charted using structured forms and narratively summarized.\nA total of 131 articles were retrieved from the scoping review for the 3 research questions that were the focus of this manuscript (118 from database sources and 13 from targeted websites). Emerging AI technologies discussed in the review included predictive analytics, smart homes, virtual health care assistants, and robots. The results indicated that AI has already begun to influence nursing roles, workflows, and the nurse-patient relationship. In general, robots are not viewed as replacements for nurses. There is a consensus that health technologies powered by AI may have the potential to enhance nursing practice. Consequently, nurses must proactively define how person-centered compassionate care will be preserved in the age of AI.\nNurses have a shared responsibility to influence decisions related to the integration of AI into the health system and to ensure that this change is introduced in a way that is ethical and aligns with core nursing values such as compassionate care. Furthermore, nurses must advocate for patient and nursing involvement in all aspects of the design, implementation, and evaluation of these technologies.\nRR2-10.2196/17490.",

    "results": "A total of 131 articles were retrieved from the scoping review for the 3 research questions that were the focus of this manuscript (118 from database sources and 13 from targeted websites). Emerging AI technologies discussed in the review included predictive analytics, smart homes, virtual health care assistants, and robots. The results indicated that AI has already begun to influence nursing roles, workflows, and the nurse-patient relationship. In general, robots are not viewed as replacements for nurses. There is a consensus that health technologies powered by AI may have the potential to enhance nursing practice. Consequently, nurses must proactively define how person-centered compassionate care will be preserved in the age of AI.",

    "abstract": "Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) is emerging as an advance terminology for monitoring and controlling the underwater aquatic life. This technology determines the undiscovered resources present in the water through computational intelligence (CI) techniques. CI here pertains to the capability of a system to acquire a specific task from data or experimental surveillance below the water. In today's time data is considered as the identity for everything that exists in nature, whether that data is related to human beings, machines or any type of device like internet of underwater things (IoUT). The collected data should be correct, complete and fulfill the requirements of a particular task to be done. Underwater data collection is very tough because of sensors mobility due to water drift 3 meters/sec, crest and trough. A lot of packet drop also exists due to underwater conditions that hurdles the data collection process. Various techniques already exists for efficient collection of data below the water but these are not properly classified. This manuscript has summarized the concept of data collection in UWSN along with its classification based on routing. Also, a short discussion about existence of CORONA below the water along with water purification is carried out. Furthermore, some data routing approaches are also analyzed on the basis of quality of service parameters and the current challenges to be tackled during data collection are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 outbreak has put the whole world in an unprecedented difficult situation bringing life around the world to a frightening halt and claiming thousands of lives. Due to COVID-19's spread in 212 countries and territories and increasing numbers of infected cases and death tolls mounting to 5,212,172 and 334,915 (as of May 22 2020), it remains a real threat to the public health system. This paper renders a response to combat the virus through Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some Deep Learning (DL) methods have been illustrated to reach this goal, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Long/Short Term Memory (LSTM). It delineates an integrated bioinformatics approach in which different aspects of information from a continuum of structured and unstructured data sources are put together to form the user-friendly platforms for physicians and researchers. The main advantage of these AI-based platforms is to accelerate the process of diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 disease. The most recent related publications and medical reports were investigated with the purpose of choosing inputs and targets of the network that could facilitate reaching a reliable Artificial Neural Network-based tool for challenges associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, there are some specific inputs for each platform, including various forms of the data, such as clinical data and medical imaging which can improve the performance of the introduced approaches toward the best responses in practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a field of computer science aimed to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. Currently, AI is recognized in the broader technology radar within the five key technologies which emerge for their wide-ranging applications and impact in communities, companies, business, and value chain framework alike. However, AI in medical imaging is at an early phase of development, and there are still hurdles to take related to reliability, user confidence, and adoption. The present narrative review aimed to provide an overview on AI-based approaches (distributed learning, statistical learning, computer-aided diagnosis and detection systems, fully automated image analysis tool, natural language processing) in oncological hybrid medical imaging with respect to clinical tasks (detection, contouring and segmentation, prediction of histology and tumor stage, prediction of mutational status and molecular therapies targets, prediction of treatment response, and outcome). Particularly, AI-based approaches have been briefly described according to their purpose and, finally lung cancer-being one of the most extensively malignancy studied by hybrid medical imaging-has been used as illustrative scenario. Finally, we discussed clinical challenges and open issues including ethics, validation strategies, effective data-sharing methods, regulatory hurdles, educational resources, and strategy to facilitate the interaction among different stakeholders. Some of the major changes in medical imaging will come from the application of AI to workflow and protocols, eventually resulting in improved patient management and quality of life. Overall, several time-consuming tasks could be automatized. Machine learning algorithms and neural networks will permit sophisticated analysis resulting not only in major improvements in disease characterization through imaging, but also in the integration of multiple-omics data (i.e., derived from pathology, genomic, proteomics, and demographics) for multi-dimensional disease featuring. Nevertheless, to accelerate the transition of the theory to practice a sustainable development plan considering the multi-dimensional interactions between professionals, technology, industry, markets, policy, culture, and civil society directed by a mindset which will allow talents to thrive is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Esophageal cancer is the eight most common cancer in the world and is associated with a poor prognosis. Significant efforts are necessary to improve the detection of early squamous cell cancer such that curative endoscopic therapy can be offered. Studies have shown an overall miss rate of esophageal cancer of up to 6.4%. Human factors including fatigue and lack of attention may be a contributory factor. Computer aided detection and characterisation of early squamous cell cancer can be a second reader which potentially offsets these factors. Recent studies developing artificial intelligence systems show real promise in the detection of early squamous cell cancer and predicting depth of invasion to aid in the management of patients in the same endoscopic session. This has the potential to revolutionise this area of endoscopy.",

However, the published literature for AI in biliopancreatic endoscopy is predominantly limited to early pre-clinical studies including applications for diagnostic EUS and patient risk stratification. Potential future use cases are highlighted in this manuscript including optical characterisation of strictures during cholangioscopy, prediction of post-ERCP acute pancreatitis and selective biliary duct cannulation difficulty, automated report generation and novel AI-based quality key performance metrics. To realise the full potential of AI and accelerate innovation, it is crucial that robust inter-disciplinary collaborations are formed between biliopancreatic endoscopists and AI researchers.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is of keen interest for global health development as potential support for current human shortcomings. Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is an excellent substrate for AI, since it holds the genuine potential to improve quality in GI endoscopy and overall patient care by improving detection and diagnosis guiding the endoscopists in performing endoscopy to the highest quality standards. The possibility of large data acquisitioning to refine algorithms makes implementation of AI into daily practice a potential reality. With the start of a new era adopting deep learning, large amounts of data can easily be processed, resulting in better diagnostic performances. In the upper gastrointestinal tract, research currently focusses on the detection and characterization of neoplasia, including Barrett's, squamous cell and gastric carcinoma, with an increasing amount of AI studies demonstrating the potential and benefit of AI-augmented endoscopy. Deep learning applied to small bowel video capsule endoscopy also appears to enhance pathology detection and reduce capsule reading time. In the colon, multiple prospective trials including five randomized trials, showed a consistent improvement in polyp and adenoma detection rates, one of the main quality indicators in endoscopy. There are however potential additional roles for AI to assist in quality improvement of endoscopic procedures, training and therapeutic decision making. Further large-scale, multicenter validation trials are required before AI-augmented diagnostic gastrointestinal endoscopy can be integrated into our routine clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Since colonoscopy and polypectomy were introduced, Colorectal Cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality decreased significantly. Although we have entered the era of quality measurement and improvement, literature shows that a considerable amount of colorectal neoplasia is still missed by colonoscopists up to 25%, leading to an high rate of interval colorectal cancer that account for nearly 10% of all diagnosed CRC. Two main reasons have been recognised: recognition failure and mucosal exposure. For this purpose, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have been recently developed that identify a \"hot\" area during the endoscopic examination. In retrospective studies, where the systems are tested with a batch of unknown images, deep learning systems have shown very good performances, with high levels of accuracy. Of course, this setting may not reflect actual clinical practice where different pitfalls can occur, like suboptimal bowel preparation or poor examination technique. For this reason, a number of randomised clinical trials have recently been published where AI was tested in real time during endoscopic examinations. We present here an overview on recent literature addressing the performance of Computer Assisted Detection (CADe) of colorectal polyps in colonoscopy.",

Its incidence varies throughout countries, and screening has been found to be cost-effective at least in high-incidence regions. Identification of individuals harbouring preneoplastic lesions and their surveillance or of those with early gastric cancer are extremely important processes and endoscopy play a key role for this purpose. Unfortunately, also quality and accuracy for endoscopic detection varies among centres and endoscopists. Recent studies about Artificial Intelligence applied to endoscopic imaging show that these technologies perform very well and could be extremely useful for endoscopists to achieve the accuracy needed for gastric cancer screening. Nonetheless, as its introduction in this field is very recent, most studies are carried out offline and its results in clinical practice need to be further validated namely by incorporating all the components/dimensions of endoscopy from pre to post-assessment.",

Experimental and computational developments have recently opened doors to applications of spatial metabolomics in life sciences and biomedicine. At the same time, these advances have coincided with a rapid evolution in machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, which are transforming our everyday life and promise to revolutionize biology and healthcare.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) could change the practice of gastroenterology through its ability to both acquire and analyze information with speed, reproducibility, and, potentially, insight that may exceed that of human medical specialists. AI is powered by computational methods that allow machines to replicate clinical pattern recognition used by gastroenterology specialists to interpret endoscopic or cross-sectional images; understand the meaning and intent of medical documents; and merge different types of data to infer a diagnosis, prognosis, or expected outcome. Ongoing research is studying the use of AI for automated interpretation of text from colonoscopy and clinical documents for improved quality and patient phenotyping as well as enhanced detection and descriptions of polyps and other endoscopic lesions, and for predicting the probability of future therapeutic response early in a treatment course. This article introduces emerging technologies of natural language processing, machine vision, and machine learning for data analytics, and describes current and future applications in gastroenterology.",

    "abstract": "In Low- and Middle- Income Countries (LMICs), machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) offer attractive solutions to address the shortage of health care resources and improve the capacity of the local health care infrastructure. However, AI and ML should also be used cautiously, due to potential issues of fairness and algorithmic bias that may arise if not applied properly. Furthermore, populations in LMICs can be particularly vulnerable to bias and fairness in AI algorithms, due to a lack of technical capacity, existing social bias against minority groups, and a lack of legal protections. In order to address the need for better guidance within the context of global health, we describe three basic criteria (Appropriateness, Fairness, and Bias) that can be used to help evaluate the use of machine learning and AI systems: 1) APPROPRIATENESS is the process of deciding how the algorithm should be used in the local context, and properly matching the machine learning model to the target population; 2) BIAS is a systematic tendency in a model to favor one demographic group vs another, which can be mitigated but can lead to unfairness; and 3) FAIRNESS involves examining the impact on various demographic groups and choosing one of several mathematical definitions of group fairness that will adequately satisfy the desired set of legal, cultural, and ethical requirements. Finally, we illustrate how these principles can be applied using a case study of machine learning applied to the diagnosis and screening of pulmonary disease in Pune, India. We hope that these methods and principles can help guide researchers and organizations working in global health who are considering the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI-ML) have taken center stage in medical imaging. To develop as leaders in AI-ML, radiology residents may seek a formative data science experience. The authors piloted an elective Data Science Pathway (DSP) for 4th-year residents at the authors' institution in collaboration with the MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS). The goal of the DSP was to provide an introduction to AI-ML through a flexible schedule of educational, experiential, and research activities. The study describes the initial experience with the DSP tailored to the AI-ML interests of three senior radiology residents. The authors also discuss logistics and curricular design with common core elements and shared mentorship. Residents were provided dedicated, full-time immersion into the CCDS work environment. In the initial DSP pilot, residents were successfully integrated into AI-ML projects at CCDS. Residents were exposed to all aspects of AI-ML application development, including data curation, model design, quality control, and clinical testing. Core concepts in AI-ML were taught through didactic sessions and daily collaboration with data scientists and other staff. Work during the pilot period led to 12 accepted abstracts for presentation at national meetings. The DSP is a feasible, well-rounded introductory experience in AI-ML for senior radiology residents. Residents contributed to model and tool development at multiple stages and were academically productive. Feedback from the pilot resulted in establishment of a formal AI-ML curriculum for future residents. The described logistical, planning, and curricular considerations provide a framework for DSP implementation at other institutions. ",

Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and reading time were assessed as endpoints.\nThe average AUC across readers was 0.769 (95% CI: 0.724, 0.814) without AI and 0.797 (95% CI: 0.754, 0.840) with AI. The average difference in AUC was 0.028 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.055, \nThis clinical investigation demonstrated that the concurrent use of this AI tool improved the diagnostic performance of radiologists in the detection of breast cancer without prolonging their workflow.",

    "abstract": "Applying state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing on approximately one million of teleconsultation records, we developed a triage system, now certified and in use at the largest European telemedicine provider. The system evaluates care alternatives through interactions with patients via a mobile application. Reasoning on an initial set of provided symptoms, the triage application generates AI-powered, personalized questions to better characterize the problem and recommends the most appropriate point of care and time frame for a consultation. The underlying technology was developed to meet the needs for performance, transparency, user acceptance and ease of use, central aspects to the adoption of AI-based decision support systems. Providing such remote guidance at the beginning of the chain of care has significant potential for improving cost efficiency, patient experience and outcomes. Being remote, always available and highly scalable, this service is fundamental in high demand situations, such as the current COVID-19 outbreak.",

    "abstract": "Water exchange (WE) and artificial intelligence (AI) have made critical advances during the past decade. WE significantly increases adenoma detection and AI holds the potential to help endoscopists detect more polyps and adenomas. We performed an electronic literature search on PubMed using the following keywords: water-assisted and water exchange colonoscopy, adenoma and polyp detection, artificial intelligence, deep learning, neural networks, and computer-aided colonoscopy. We reviewed relevant articles published in English from 2010 to May 2020. Additional articles were searched manually from the reference lists of the publications reviewed. We discussed recent advances in both WE and AI, including their advantages and limitations. AI may mitigate operator-dependent factors that limit the potential of WE. By increasing bowel cleanliness and improving visualization, WE may provide the platform to optimize the performance of AI for colonoscopies. The strengths of WE and AI may complement each other in spite of their weaknesses to maximize adenoma detection.",

    "abstract": "Studies have demonstrated the potential of online adaptive radiotherapy (oART). However, routine use has been limited due to resource demanding solutions. This study reports on experiences with oART in the pelvic region using a novel cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-based, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven solution.\nAutomated pre-treatment planning for thirty-nine pelvic cases (bladder, rectum, anal, and prostate), and one hundred oART simulations were conducted in a pre-clinical release of Ethos (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Plan quality, AI-segmentation accuracy, oART feasibility and an integrated calculation-based quality assurance solution were evaluated. Experiences from the first five clinical oART patients (three bladder, one rectum and one sarcoma) are reported.\nAuto-generated pre-treatment plans demonstrated similar planning target volume (PTV) coverage and organs at risk doses, compared to institution reference. More than 75% of AI-segmentations during simulated oART required none or minor editing and the adapted plan was superior in 88% of cases. Limitations in AI-segmentation correlated to cases where AI model training was lacking. The five first treated patients complied well with the median adaptive procedure duration of 17.6\u00a0min (from CBCT acceptance to treatment delivery start). The treated bladder patients demonstrated a 42% median primary PTV reduction, indicating a 24%-30% reduction in V\nA novel commercial oART solution was demonstrated feasible for various pelvic sites. Clinically acceptable AI-segmentation and auto-planning enabled adaptation within reasonable timeslots. Possibilities for reduced PTVs observed for bladder cancer indicated potential for toxicity reductions.",

More than 75% of AI-segmentations during simulated oART required none or minor editing and the adapted plan was superior in 88% of cases. Limitations in AI-segmentation correlated to cases where AI model training was lacking. The five first treated patients complied well with the median adaptive procedure duration of 17.6\u00a0min (from CBCT acceptance to treatment delivery start). The treated bladder patients demonstrated a 42% median primary PTV reduction, indicating a 24%-30% reduction in V",

    "abstract": "The impaired regulation of emotional responses has significant social consequences for patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and can be thought to increase the risk for technological addictions.\nDitto objective of the present research is to investigate the relationship between technological addictions and trait emotional intelligence (EI) in adolescents with ADHD.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted in 150 treatment-na\u00efve adolescents with ADHD, aged 12-18 years. The sociodemographic information form, the Emotional Quotient-Inventory: Youth Version (EQ-i: YV), Internet Addiction Test, Smartphone Addiction Scale, and Conners' Parent Rating Scales were used for data collection.\nThe findings revealed that ADHD-C and female patients have lower mean stress management scores on EQ-i: YV. Patients who have smartphone addiction (SA)/problematic internet usage have lower total EI and stress management scores. The oppositional, hyperactivity, and DSM-total scores were negatively correlated with stress management scores. Intrapersonal and stress management scores were negatively correlated to SA symptoms.\nThe stress management dimension was the strongest factor related to ADHD and technological addictions. In adolescents with ADHD, stress management may be the key factor to cope with daily problems. Therefore, the interventions to develop EI can be a therapeutic option in ADHD and technological addictions.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has illustrated drastic changes in radiology and medical imaging techniques which in turn led to tremendous changes in screening patterns. In particular, advancements in these techniques led to the development of computer aided detection (CAD) strategy. These approaches provided highly accurate diagnostic reports which served as a \"second-opinion\" to the radiologists. However, with significant advancements in artificial intelligence strategy, the diagnostic and classifying capabilities of CAD system are meeting the levels of radiologists and clinicians. Thus, it shifts the CAD system from second opinion approach to a high utility tool. This article reviews the strategies and algorithms developed using artificial intelligence for the foremost cancer diagnosis and classification which overcomes the challenges in the traditional method. In addition, the possible direction of AI in medical aspects is also discussed in this study.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to diagnose the incidence of restless leg syndrome (RLS) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) type-2, thorough artificial intelligence based multilayer perceptron (MLP). 300 cases of diabetes mellitus type-2, of age between 18-80 years were included. Point-biserial correlation/Pearson Chi-Square correlations were conducted between RLS and risk factors. We trained a backpropagation MLP via. supervised learning algorithm to predict clinical outcome for RLS. Majority of the patients were having hypertension (63%) and with peripheral neuropathy (69%). Two mostly reported scaled parameters were: 18% 'tiredness' and 14%, 'impact on mood'. A significant correlation was found in RLS with smoking, hypertension and chronic renal failure (CRF). MLP model achieved more than 95% accuracy in predicting the outcome with cross entropy error 0.5%. Following scaled symptomatic variables: 'need/urge to move' (100%) achieved the highest normalized importance, followed by 'relief by moving' (85.7%), 'sleep disturbance' (62%) and 'impact on mood' (51.3%). Artificial intelligence based models can help physicians to identify the pre diagnose RLS, so that active measures can be taken in time to avoid further complications.",

    "abstract": "Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the use of agent-based systems in the healthcare system have attracted various researchers to improve the efficiency and utility in the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Nowadays, one of the most important and creative developments is the integration of AI and Blockchain that is, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to enable better and decentralized governance. Privacy and security is a critical piece in EHR implementation and/or adoption. Health records are updated every time a patient visits a doctor as they contain important information about the health and wellbeing of the patient and describes the history of care received during the past and to date. Therefore, such records are critical to research, hospitals, emergency rooms, healthcare laboratories, and even health insurance providers.\nIn this article, a platform employing the AI and the use of multi-agent based systems along with the DLT technology for privacy preservation is proposed. The emphasis of security and privacy is highlighted during the process of collecting, managing and distributing EHR data.\nThis article aims to ensure privacy, integrity and security metrics of the electronic health records are met when such copies are not only immutable but also distributed. The findings of this work will help guide the development of further techniques using the combination of AI and multi-agent based systems backed by DLT technology for secure and effective handling EHR data. This proposed architecture uses various AI-based intelligent based agents and blockchain for providing privacy and security in EHR. Future enhancement in this work can be the addition of the biometric based systems for improved security.",

    "abstract": "Many studies who evaluated the outcome of the congenital hypothyroidism (CH) screening reported some intellectual and behavioral deficit despite early diagnose and treatment. The aim of the present study was to compare the intellectual and behavioral adjustment of CH children with controls.\nThis study was conducted among a group of 135 children aged 8--12 years in Isfahan, including transient and permanent congenital hypothyroidism (TCH and PCH) and a matched group of their classmate. Demographic characteristics collected using a designed data collecting form completed by parents. Intellectual quotient (IQ) was evaluated using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children aged 6--16 years (WISC-III). Depression and anxiety were evaluated using The Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC), respectively. The SPSS software version 20.0 was used for data analysis. Nonparametric tests (Mann--Whitney) were used to investigate the association between variables. A significant level of less than 0.05 was considered in all analyzes.\nThere was no significant difference in the IQ scores between PCH and TCH groups (\nThere is no significant difference in anxiety and depression scores between congenital hypothyroidism children and controls, although IQ scores in children with congenital hypothyroidism is lower than controls.",

    "abstract": "Advances in computerized image analysis and the use of artificial intelligence-based approaches for image-based analysis and construction of prediction algorithms represent a new era for noninvasive biomarker discovery. In recent literature, it has become apparent that radiologic images can serve as mineable databases that contain large amounts of quantitative features with potential clinical significance. Extraction and analysis of these quantitative features is commonly referred to as texture or radiomic analysis. Numerous studies have demonstrated applications for texture and radiomic characterization methods for assessing brain tumors to improve noninvasive predictions of tumor histologic characteristics, molecular profile, distinction of treatment-related changes, and prediction of patient survival. In this review, the current use and future potential of texture or radiomic-based approaches with machine learning for brain tumor image analysis and prediction algorithm construction will be discussed. This technology has the potential to advance the value of diagnostic imaging by extracting currently unused information on medical scans that enables more precise, personalized therapy; however, significant barriers must be overcome if this technology is to be successfully implemented on a wide scale for routine use in the clinical setting.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has numerous applications in surgical quality assurance. We assessed AI accuracy in evaluating the critical view of safety (CVS) and intraoperative events during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We hypothesized that AI accuracy and intraoperative events are associated with disease severity.\nOne thousand fifty-one laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos were annotated by AI for disease severity (Parkland Scale), CVS achievement (Strasberg Criteria), and intraoperative events. Surgeons performed focused video review on procedures with \u22651 intraoperative events (n = 335). AI versus surgeon annotation of CVS components and intraoperative events were compared. For all cases (n = 1051), intraoperative-event association with CVS achievement and severity was examined using ordinal logistic regression.\nUsing AI annotation, surgeons reviewed 50\u200avideos/hr. CVS was achieved in \u226410% of cases. Hepatocystic triangle and cystic plate visualization was achieved more often in low-severity cases (P < 0.03). AI-surgeon agreement for all CVS components exceeded 75%, with higher agreement in high-severity cases (P < 0.03). Surgeons agreed with 99% of AI-annotated intraoperative events. AI-annotated intraoperative events were associated with both disease severity and number of CVS components not achieved. Intraoperative events occurred more frequently in high-severity versus low-severity cases (0.98 vs 0.40\u200aevents/case, P < 0.001).\nAI annotation allows for efficient video review and is a promising quality assurance tool. Disease severity may limit its use and surgeon oversight is still required, especially in complex cases. Continued refinement may improve AI applicability and allow for automated assessment.",

    "abstract": "The US population is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse. Research suggests that cultural diversity within organizations can increase team potency and performance, yet this theory has not been explored in the field of surgery. Furthermore, when surveyed, patients express a desire for their care provider to mirror their own race and ethnicity. In the present study, we hypothesize that there is a positive correlation between a high ranking by the US News and World Report for gastroenterology and gastrointestinal (GI) surgery and greater racial, ethnic, and gender diversity among the physicians and surgeons.\nWe used the 2019 US News and World Report rankings for best hospitals by specialty to categorize gastroenterology and GI surgery departments into 2 groups: 1-50 and 51-100. Hospital websites of these top 100 were viewed to determine if racial diversity and inclusion were highlighted in the hospitals' core values or mission statements. To determine the rates of diversity within departments, Betaface (Betaface.com) facial analysis software was used to analyze photos taken from the hospitals' websites. This software was able to determine the race, ethnicity, and gender of the care providers. We examined the racial and ethnic makeup of the populations served by these hospitals to see if the gastroenterologists and surgeons adequately represented the state population. We then ran the independent samples t-test to determine if there was a difference in rankings of more diverse departments.\nHospitals with gastroenterology and GI surgery departments in the top 50 were more likely to mention diversity on their websites compared with hospitals that ranked from 51-100 (76% versus 56%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.035). The top 50 hospitals had a statistically significant higher percentage of underrepresented minority GI physicians and surgeons (7.01% versus 4.04%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In the 31 states where these hospitals were located, there were more African Americans (13% versus 3%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and Hispanics (12% versus 2%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), while there were fewer Asians (4% versus 21%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in the population compared with the faculty.\nWe used artificial intelligence software to determine the degree of racial and ethnic diversity in gastroenterology and GI surgery departments across the county. Higher ranking hospitals had a greater degree of diversity of their faculty and were more likely to emphasize diversity in their mission statements. Hospitals stress the importance of having a culturally diverse staff, yet their care providers may not adequately reflect the populations they serve. Further work is needed to prospectively track diversity rates over time and correlate these changes with measurable outcomes.",

We present the state-of-the-art and some use cases, followed by a discussion of challenges. Our perspective on addressing these is that while they typically have a technical nature, they nevertheless require an interdisciplinary approach combining natural language processing and artificial intelligence with expert domain knowledge to create practical tools and comprehensive analysis for the food domain.",

    "abstract": "AI virtual assistants have significant potential to alleviate the pressure on overly burdened healthcare systems by enabling patients to self-assess their symptoms and to seek further care when appropriate. For these systems to make a meaningful contribution to healthcare globally, they must be trusted by patients and healthcare professionals alike, and service the needs of patients in diverse regions and segments of the population. We developed an AI virtual assistant which provides patients with triage and diagnostic information. Crucially, the system is based on a generative model, which allows for relatively straightforward re-parameterization to reflect local disease and risk factor burden in diverse regions and population segments. This is an appealing property, particularly when considering the potential of AI systems to improve the provision of healthcare on a global scale in many regions and for both developing and developed countries. We performed a prospective validation study of the accuracy and safety of the AI system and human doctors. Importantly, we assessed the accuracy and safety of both the AI and human doctors independently against identical clinical cases and, unlike previous studies, also accounted for the information gathering process of both agents. Overall, we found that the AI system is able to provide patients with triage and diagnostic information with a level of clinical accuracy and safety comparable to that of human doctors. Through this approach and study, we hope to start building trust in AI-powered systems by directly comparing their performance to human doctors, who do not always agree with each other on the cause of patients' symptoms or the most appropriate triage recommendation.",

    "abstract": "Violence against children is a global public health threat of considerable concern. At least half of all children worldwide experience violence every year; globally, the total number of children between the ages of 2 and 17 years who have experienced violence in any given year is one billion. Based on a review of the literature, we argue that there is substantial potential for AI (and associated machine learning and big data), and mHealth approaches to be utilized to prevent and address violence at a large scale.

    "abstract": "Incidence and mortality rates of endometrial cancer are increasing, leading to increased interest in endometrial cancer risk prediction and stratification to help in screening and prevention. Previous risk models have had moderate success with the area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.68 to 0.77. Here we demonstrate a population-based machine learning model for endometrial cancer screening that achieves a testing AUC of 0.96. We train seven machine learning algorithms based solely on personal health data, without any genomic, imaging, biomarkers, or invasive procedures. The data come from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). We further compare our machine learning model with 15 gynecologic oncologists and primary care physicians in the stratification of endometrial cancer risk for 100 women. We find a random forest model that achieves a testing AUC of 0.96 and a neural network model that achieves a testing AUC of 0.91. We test both models in risk stratification against 15 practicing physicians. Our random forest model is 2.5 times better at identifying above-average risk women with a 2-fold reduction in the false positive rate. Our neural network model is 2 times better at identifying above-average risk women with a 3-fold reduction in the false positive rate. Our machine learning models provide a non-invasive and cost-effective way to identify high-risk sub-populations who may benefit from early screening of endometrial cancer, prior to disease onset. Through statistical biopsy of personal health data, we have identified a new and effective approach for early cancer detection and prevention for individual patients.",

    "abstract": "The field artificial intelligence (AI) was founded over 65\u00a0years ago. Starting with great hopes and ambitious goals the field progressed through various stages of popularity and has recently undergone a revival through the introduction of deep neural networks. Some problems of AI are that, so far, neither the \"intelligence\" nor the goals of AI are formally defined causing confusion when comparing AI to other fields. In this paper, we present a perspective on the desired and current status of AI in relation to machine learning and statistics and clarify common misconceptions and myths. Our discussion is intended to lift the veil of vagueness surrounding AI to reveal its true countenance.",

    "abstract": "For people living with an ostomy, development of peristomal skin complications (PSCs) is the most common post-operative challenge. A visual sign of PSCs is discoloration (redness) of the peristomal skin often resulting from leakage of ostomy output under the baseplate. If left unattended, a mild skin condition may progress into a severe disorder; consequently, it is important to monitor discoloration and leakage patterns closely. The Ostomy Skin Tool is current state-of-the-art for evaluation of peristomal skin, but it relies on patients visiting their healthcare professional regularly. To enable close monitoring of peristomal skin over time, an automated strategy not relying on scheduled consultations is required. Several medical fields have implemented automated image analysis based on artificial intelligence, and these deep learning algorithms have become increasingly recognized as a valuable tool in healthcare. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to develop deep learning algorithms which could provide automated, consistent, and objective assessments of changes in peristomal skin discoloration and leakage patterns. A total of 614 peristomal skin images were used for development of the discoloration model, which predicted the area of the discolored peristomal skin with an accuracy of 95% alongside precision and recall scores of 79.6 and 75.0%, respectively. The algorithm predicting leakage patterns was developed based on 954 product images, and leakage area was determined with 98.8% accuracy, 75.0% precision, and 71.5% recall. Combined, these data for the first time demonstrate implementation of artificial intelligence for automated assessment of changes in peristomal skin discoloration and leakage patterns.",

    "abstract": "There is no large contemporary data from India to see the prevalence of burnout in HCWs in covid era. Burnout and mental stress is associated with electrocardiographic changes detectable by artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe present study aims to estimate the prevalence of burnout in HCWs in COVID-19 era using Mini Z-scale and to develop predictive AI model to detect burnout in HCWs in COVID-19 era.\nThis is an observational and cross-sectional study to evaluate the presence of burnout in HCWs in academic tertiary care centres of North India in the COVID-19 era. At least 900 participants will be enrolled in this study from four leading premier government-funded/public-private centres of North India. Each study centre will be asked to recruit HCWs by approaching them through various listed ways for participation in the study. Interested participants after initial screening and meeting the eligibility criteria, will be asked to fill the questionnaire (having demographic and work related with Mini Z questionnaire) to assess burnout. The healthcare workers will include physicians at all levels of training, nursing staff and paramedical staff who are involved directly or indirectly in COVID-19 care. The analysis of the raw electrocardiogram (ECG) data and development of algorithm using convolutional neural networks (CNN) will be done by experts.\nIn Summary, we propose that ECG data generated from the people with burnout can be utilized to develop AI-enabled model to predict the presence of stress and burnout in HCWs in COVID-19 era.",

    "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in a variety of research fields is speeding up multiple digital revolutions, from shifting paradigms in healthcare, precision medicine and wearable sensing, to public services and education offered to the masses around the world, to future cities made optimally efficient by autonomous driving. When a revolution happens, the consequences are not obvious straight away, and to date, there is no uniformly adapted framework to guide AI research to ensure a sustainable societal transition. To answer this need, here we analyze three key challenges to interdisciplinary AI research, and deliver three broad conclusions: 1) future development of AI should not only impact other scientific domains but should also take inspiration and benefit from other fields of science, 2) AI research must be accompanied by decision explainability, dataset bias transparency as well as development of evaluation methodologies and creation of regulatory agencies to ensure responsibility, and 3) AI education should receive more attention, efforts and innovation from the educational and scientific communities. Our analysis is of interest not only to AI practitioners but also to other researchers and the general public as it offers ways to guide the emerging collaborations and interactions toward the most fruitful outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to explore the raters' agreement and the effect of raters' and targets' gender on self- and parental intelligence assessments in the sample of Croatian twins. Twins were asked to assess their own and their parents' overall intelligence, as well as specific abilities from the Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences. Data was analysed to explore: i) twins' agreement in parental assessments and behavioural genetic analysis of the overall intelligence estimates; ii) gender differences in self- assessments; and iii) raters' and targets' gender effects on parental assessments. The twins' mean correlation in their assessments of overall parental intelligence was .60. The differences between monozygotic and dizygotic twin correlations were nonsignificant for all of the estimated abilities, and model fitting analysis indicates that hypothesis about genetic effect on parental assessment of intelligence should be rejected. The hypotheses about males' higher self-assessments for overall intelligence and for the masculine types of abilities - logical-mathematical, body-kinesthetic and spatial abilities - were confirmed. For the feminine types of abilities - verbal/linguistic, inter- and intra- personal intelligences - there were no significant gender effects. Both target and rater effect were found for the parental estimates of intelligence. Fathers were estimated higher on overall intelligence, logical-mathematical, body-kinesthetic and spatial abilities, while mothers were estimated higher on interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence. The effect of the raters' gender was found for overall intelligence as well as for inter- and intra- personal intelligences, where males gave higher estimates of parental intelligences than females.",

    "abstract": "Rapport is an integral part of interviewing, viewed as fundamental to the success of intelligence elicitation. One collection capability is human intelligence (HUMINT), the discipline charged with eliciting intelligence through interactions with human sources, such as covert human intelligence sources (CHIS). To date, research has yet to explore the perceptions and experiences of intelligence operatives responsible for gathering HUMINT within England and Wales. The present study consisted of structured interviews with police source handlers (N = 24). Rapport was perceived as essential, especially for maximising the opportunity for intelligence elicitation. Participants provided a range of rapport strategies while highlighting the importance of establishing, and maintaining, rapport. The majority of participants believed rapport could be trained to some degree. Thus, rapport was not viewed exclusively as a natural skill. However, participants commonly perceived some natural attributes are required to build rapport that can be refined and developed through training and experience.",

    "abstract": "There is optimism that artificial intelligence (AI) will result in positive clinical outcomes, which is driving research and investment in the use of AI for skin disease. At present, AI for skin disease is embedded in research and development and not practiced widely in clinical dermatology. Clinical dermatology is also undergoing a technological transformation in terms of the development and adoption of standards that optimizes the quality use of imaging. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is the international standard for medical imaging. DICOM is a continually evolving standard. There is considerable effort being invested in developing dermatology-specific extensions to the DICOM standard. The ability to encode relevant metadata and afford interoperability with the digital health ecosystem (e.g., image repositories, electronic medical records) has driven the initial impetus in the adoption of DICOM for dermatology. DICOM has a dedicated working group whose role is to develop a mechanism to support AI workflows and encode AI artifacts. DICOM can improve AI workflows by encoding derived objects (e.g., secondary images, visual explainability maps, AI algorithm output) and the efficient curation of multi-institutional datasets for machine learning training, testing, and validation. This can be achieved using DICOM mechanisms such as standardized image formats and metadata, metadata-based image retrieval, and de-identification protocols. DICOM can address several important technological and workflow challenges for the implementation of AI. However, many other technological, ethical, regulatory, medicolegal, and workforce barriers will need to be addressed before DICOM and AI can be used effectively in dermatology.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, an artificial intelligence segmented dynamic video image based on the process of intensive cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease monitoring is deeply investigated, and a sparse automatic coding deep neural network with a four layers stack structure is designed to automatically extract the deep features of the segmented dynamic video image shot, and six categories of normal, atrial premature, ventricular premature, right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and pacing are achieved through hierarchical training and optimization. Accurate recognition of heartbeats with an average accuracy of 99.5%. It provides technical assistance for the intelligent prediction of high-risk cardiovascular diseases like ventricular fibrillation. An intelligent prediction algorithm for sudden cardiac death based on the echolocation network was proposed. By designing an echolocation network with a multilayer serial structure, an intelligent distinction between sudden cardiac death signal and non-sudden death signal was realized, and the signal was predicted 5 min before sudden death occurred, with an average prediction accuracy of 94.32%. Using the self-learning capability of stack sparse auto-coding network, a large amount of label-free data is designed to train the stack sparse auto-coding deep neural network to automatically extract deep representations of plaque features. A small amount of labeled data then introduced to micro-train the entire network. Through the automatic analysis of the fiber cap thickness in the plaques, the automatic identification of thin fiber cap-like vulnerable plaques was achieved, and the average overlap of vulnerable regions reached 87%. The overall time for the automatic plaque and vulnerable plaque recognition algorithm was 0.54 s. It provides theoretical support for accurate diagnosis and endogenous analysis of high-risk cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid cancers (TC) have increasingly been detected following advances in diagnostic methods. Risk stratification guided by refined information becomes a crucial step toward the goal of personalized medicine. The diagnosis of TC mainly relies on imaging analysis, but visual examination may not reveal much information and not enable comprehensive analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology used to extract and quantify key image information by simulating complex human functions. This latent, precise information contributes to stratify TC on the distinct risk and drives tailored management to transit from the surface (population-based) to a point (individual-based). In this review, we started with several challenges regarding personalized care in TC, for example, inconsistent rating ability of ultrasound physicians, uncertainty in cytopathological diagnosis, difficulty in discriminating follicular neoplasms, and inaccurate prognostication. We then analyzed and summarized the advances of AI to extract and analyze morphological, textural, and molecular features to reveal the ground truth of TC. Consequently, their combination with AI technology will make individual medical strategies possible.",

    "abstract": "Personalized and novel evidence-based clinical treatment strategy consulting for colorectal cancer has been available through various artificial intelligence (AI) supporting systems such as Watson for Oncology (WFO) from IBM. However, the potential effects of this supporting tool in cancer care have not been thoroughly explored in real-world studies. This research aims to investigate the concordance between treatment recommendations for colorectal cancer patients made by WFO and a multidisciplinary team (MDT) at a major comprehensive gastrointestinal cancer center.\nIn this prospective study, both WFO and the blinded MDT's treatment recommendations were provided concurrently for enrolled colorectal cancers of stages II to IV between March 2017 and January 2018 at Shanghai Minimally Invasive Surgery Center. Concordance was achieved if the cancer team's decisions were listed in the \"recommended\" or \"for consideration\" classification in WFO. A review was carried out after 100 cases for all non-concordant patients to explain the inconsistency, and corresponding feedback was given to WFO's database. The concordance of the subsequent cases was analyzed to evaluate both the performance and learning ability of WFO.\nOverall, 250 patients met the inclusion criteria and were recruited in the study. Eighty-one were diagnosed with colon cancer and 189 with rectal cancer. The concordances for colon cancer, rectal cancer, or overall were all 91%. The overall rates were 83, 94, and 88% in subgroups of stages II, III, and IV. When categorized by treatment strategy, concordances were 97, 93, 89, 87, and 100% for neoadjuvant, surgery, adjuvant, first line, and second line treatment groups, respectively. After analyzing the main factors causing discordance, relative updates were made in the database accordingly, which led to the concordance curve rising in most groups compared with the initial rates.\nClinical recommendations made by WFO and the cancer team were highly matched for colorectal cancer. Patient age, cancer stage, and the consideration of previous therapy details had a significant influence on concordance. Addressing these perspectives will facilitate the use of the cancer decision-support systems to help oncologists achieve the promise of precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has found its way into numerous fields of medicine in the past decade, spurred by the availability of big data and powerful processors. For the COVID-19 pandemic, aside from predicting its onset, artificial intelligence has been used to track disease spread, detect pulmonary involvement in computed tomography scans, risk-stratify patients, and model virtual protein structure and potential therapeutic agents. This mini-review briefly discusses the potential applications of artificial intelligence in COVID-19 microscopy.",

    "abstract": "To develop an artificial intelligence-based full-process solution for rectal cancer radiotherapy.\nA full-process solution that integrates autosegmentation and automatic treatment planning was developed under a single deep-learning framework. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to generate segmentations of the target and the organs at risk (OAR) as well as dose distribution. A script in Pinnacle that simulates the treatment planning process was used to execute plan optimization. A total of 172 rectal cancer patients were used for model training, and 18 patients were used for model validation. Another 40 rectal cancer patients were used for an end-to-end evaluation for both autosegmentation and treatment planning. The PTV and OAR segmentation was compared with manual segmentation. The planning results was evaluated by both objective and subjective assessment.\nThe total time for full-process planning without contour modification was 7\u00a0min, and an additional 15\u00a0min may require for contour modification and re-optimization. The PTV DICE similarity coefficient was greater than 0.85 for all 40 patients in the evaluation dataset while the DICE indices of the OARs also indicated good performance. There were no significant differences between the auto plans and manual plans. The physician accepted 80% of the auto plans without any further operation.\nWe developed a deep learning-based automatic solution for rectal cancer treatment that can improve the efficiency of treatment planning.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the research is to identify specific of AI in healthcare, its nature, and specifics and to establish complexities of AI implementation in healthcare and to propose ways to eliminate them.\nMaterials and methods: This study was conducted during June-October of 2020. Through a broad literature review, analysis of EU, USA regulation acts, scientific researches and opinions of progressive-minded people in this sphere this paper provide a guide to understanding the essence of AI in healthcare and specifics of its regulation. It is based on dialectical, comparative, analytic, synthetic and comprehensive methods.\nResults: One of the first broad definitions of AI sounded like \"Artificial Intelligence is the study of ideas which enable computers to do the things that make people seem intelligent ... The central goals of Artificial Intelligence are to make computers more useful and to understand the principles which make intelligence possible.\" There are two approaches to name this technology - \"Artificial intelligence\" and \"Augmented Intelligence.\" We prefer to use a more common category of \"Artificial intelligence\" rather than \"Augmented Intelligence\" because the last one, from our point of view, leaves much space for \"human supervision\" meaning, and that will limit the sense of AI while it will undoubtedly develop in future. AI in current practice is interpreted in three forms, they are: AI as a simple electronic tool without any level of autonomy (like electronic assistant, \"calculator\"), AI as an entity with some level of autonomy, but under human control, and AI as an entity with broad autonomy, substituting human's activity wholly or partly, and we have to admit that the first one cannot be considered as AI at all in current conditions of science development. Description of AI often tends to operate with big technological products like DeepMind (by Google), Watson Health (by IBM), Healthcare's Edison (by General Electric), but in fact, a lot of smaller technologies also use AI in the healthcare field - smartphone applications, wearable health devices and other examples of the Internet of Things. At the current stage of development AI in medical practice is existing in three technical forms: software, hardware, and mixed forms using three main scientific-statistical approaches - flowchart method, database method, and decision-making method. All of them are useable, but they are differently suiting for AI implementation. The main issues of AI implementation in healthcare are connected with the nature of technology in itself, complexities of legal support in terms of safety and efficiency, privacy, ethical and liability concerns.\nConclusion: The conducted analysis makes it possible to admit a number of pros and cons in the field of AI using in healthcare. Undoubtedly this is a promising area with a lot of gaps and grey zones to fill in. Furthermore, the main challenge is not on technology itself, which is rapidly growing, evolving, and uncovering new areas of its use, but rather on the legal framework that is clearly lacking appropriate regulations and some political, ethical, and financial transformations. Thus, the core questions regarding is this technology by its nature is suitable for healthcare at all? Is the current legislative framework looking appropriate to regulate AI in terms of safety, efficiency, premarket, and postmarked monitoring? How the model of liability with connection to AI technology using in healthcare should be constructed? How to ensure privacy without the restriction of AI technology use? Should intellectual privacy rights prevail over public health concerns? Many questions to address in order to move in line with technology development and to get the benefits of its practical implementation.",

    "abstract": "Radiology historically has been a leader of digital transformation in healthcare. The introduction of digital imaging systems, picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), and teleradiology transformed radiology services over the past 30\u00a0years. Radiology is again at the crossroad for the next generation of transformation, possibly evolving as a one-stop integrated diagnostic service. Artificial intelligence and machine learning promise to offer radiology new powerful new digital tools to facilitate the next transformation. The radiology community has been developing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools based on machine learning (ML) over the past 20\u00a0years. Among various AI techniques, deep-learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) and its variants have been widely used in medical image pattern recognition. Since the 1990s, many CAD tools and products have been developed. However, clinical adoption has been slow due to a lack of substantial clinical advantages, difficulties integrating into existing workflow, and uncertain business models. This paper proposes three pathways for AI's role in radiology beyond current CNN based capabilities 1) improve the performance of CAD, 2) improve the productivity of radiology service by AI-assisted workflow, and 3) develop radiomics that integrate the data from radiology, pathology, and genomics to facilitate the emergence of a new integrated diagnostic service.",

    "abstract": "We developed a novel data-driven Artificial Intelligence-enhanced Adaptive Time Stepping algorithm (AI-ATS) that can adapt timestep sizes to underlying biophysical dynamics. We demonstrated its values in solving a complex biophysical problem, at multiple spatiotemporal scales, that describes platelet dynamics in shear blood flow. In order to achieve a significant speedup of this computationally demanding problem, we integrated a framework of novel AI algorithms into the solution of the platelet dynamics equations. Our framework involves recurrent neural network-based autoencoders by the Long Short-Term Memory and the Gated Recurrent Units as the first step for memorizing the dynamic states in long-term dependencies for the input time series, followed by two fully-connected neural networks to optimize timestep sizes and step jumps. The computational efficiency of our AI-ATS is underscored by assessing the accuracy and speed of a multiscale simulation of the platelet with the standard time stepping algorithm (STS). By adapting the timestep size, our AI-ATS guides the omission of multiple redundant time steps without sacrificing significant accuracy of the dynamics. Compared to the STS, our AI-ATS achieved a reduction of 40% unnecessary calculations while bounding the errors of mechanical and thermodynamic properties to 3%.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to understand and manage our own feelings and of others. It has emerged as one of the vital elements of success and interpersonal relations in everyday life. There are individual differences of EI depending on characteristics and behaviors of an individual, which determines their personality.\nThe present study assesses the EI and personality traits of medical students and determines the relationship of EI with personality traits of the medical students.\nThis was a cross-sectional study and was conducted among students of a government medical college, located in New Delhi. A total of 210 participants were included in the study. After obtaining written informed consent from all participants, a questionnaire consisting of demographic information, Ten-Item Personality Inventory and Schutte EI Scale, was administered. The means and proportions were calculated. Chi-square test and Pearson's correlation test were used to test significance. \nThe mean (standard deviation) age of the study participants was 21.54 (\u00b11.98) years. The majority (65.7%) of the students were male. 51% of the students had moderate EI, and high EI was seen in 49% of the students. A positive and significant relationship between personality traits and EI was found in the study.\nPersonality traits and EI are related to one another and could influence student academic achievement. Since EI influences academic performance so personality trait assessment and empathic perceptions exploration can facilitate to aid the academic performance of the students.",

    "abstract": "With advancements in science and technology, there has been phenomenal developments in the application of neural networks in dentistry. This systematic review aimed to report on the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) applications designed for endodontic diagnosis, decision-making, and prediction of prognosis.\nStudies reporting on AI applications in endodontics were identified from the electronic databases such as PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science, for original research articles published from January 1, 2000, to June 1, 2020. A total of 10 studies that met our eligibility criteria were further analyzed for qualitative data. QUADAS-2 was applied for synthesis of the quality of the studies included.\nA wide range of AI applications have been implemented in endodontics. The neural networks employed were mostly based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) in their neural architectures. These AI models have been used for locating apical foramen, retreatment predictions, prediction of periapical pathologies, detection and diagnosis of vertical root fractures, and assessment of root morphologies.\nThese studies suggest that the neural networks performed similar to the experienced professionals in terms of accuracy and precision. In some studies, these models have even outperformed the specialists.\nThese models can be of greater assistance as an expert opinion for less experienced and nonspecialists.",

    "abstract": "Can artificial intelligence and advanced image analysis extract and harness novel information derived from cytoplasmic movements of the early human embryo to predict development to blastocyst?\nIn a proof-of-principle study, 230 human preimplantation embryos were retrospectively assessed using an artificial neural network. After intracytoplasmic sperm injection, embryos underwent time-lapse monitoring for 44 h. For comparison, standard embryo assessment of each embryo by a single embryologist was carried out to predict development to blastocyst stage based on a single picture frame taken at 42 h of development. In the experimental approach, in embryos that developed to blastocyst or destined to arrest, cytoplasm movement velocity was recorded by time-lapse monitoring during the first 44 h of culture and analysed with a Particle Image Velocimetry algorithm to extract quantitative information. Three main artificial intelligence approaches, the k-Nearest Neighbour, the Long-Short Term Memory Neural Network and the hybrid ensemble classifier were used to classify the embryos.\nBlind operator assessment classified each embryo in terms of ability to develop to blastocyst, with 75.4% accuracy, 76.5% sensitivity, 74.3% specificity, 74.3% precision and 75.4% F1 score. Integration of results from artificial intelligence models with the blind operator classification, resulted in 82.6% accuracy, 79.4% sensitivity, 85.7% specificity, 84.4% precision and 81.8% F1 score.\nThe present study suggests the possibility of predicting human blastocyst development at early cleavage stages by detection of cytoplasm movement velocity and artificial intelligence analysis. This indicates the importance of the dynamics of the cytoplasm as a novel and valuable source of data to assess embryo viability.",

    "abstract": "This study contributes to the constantly accumulating evidence on the effects of customer incivility (CI) on service employee exhaustion. Previous research has demonstrated that surface acting (SA) acts as a mediating variable in the relationship between CI and exhaustion. This study extended prior findings in two ways. The results of Study 1 (315 retail sales employees, 62.2% female) demonstrated that SA mediates the positive relationship between CI and exhaustion while controlling for employees' trait positive and negative affectivity (NA). The results of Study 2 (292 customer service representatives, 51% female) supported a moderated mediation model demonstrating that trait emotional intelligence (EI) buffers the direct and indirect (through SA) effects of CI on exhaustion. Specifically, it was found that employees exposed to many uncivil customer behaviors but high in trait EI reported using less SA and, thus, experienced fewer exhaustion symptoms than their low in trait EI counterparts. These results highlight EI as an important personal resource that mitigates the adverse effects of CI on service employees' exhaustion, and suggest that organizations should consider implementing EI training programmes for their frontline service employees.",

    "abstract": "The patient's decision-making abilities are often altered in psychiatric disorders. The legal framework of psychiatric advance directives (PADs) has been made to provide care to patients in these situations while respecting their free and informed consent. The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) within Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) may result in improvements for complex decisions that are often made in situations covered by PADs. Still, it raises theoretical and ethical issues this paper aims to address. First, it goes through every level of possible intervention of AI in the PAD drafting process, beginning with what data sources it could access and if its data processing competencies should be limited, then treating of the opportune moments it should be used and its place in the contractual relationship between each party (patient, caregivers, and trusted person). Second, it focuses on ethical principles and how these principles, whether they are medical principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice) applied to AI or AI principles (loyalty and vigilance) applied to medicine, should be taken into account in the future of the PAD drafting process. Some general guidelines are proposed in conclusion: AI must remain a decision support system as a partner of each party of the PAD contract; patients should be able to choose a personalized type of AI intervention or no AI intervention at all; they should stay informed, i.e., understand the functioning and relevance of AI thanks to educational programs; finally, a committee should be created for ensuring the principle of vigilance by auditing these new tools in terms of successes, failures, security, and relevance.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, students are experiencing difficult and stressful situations due to the Global Pandemic Alert. This changing world can evoke negative emotions that have been traditionally linked to higher anxiety. Researches have been focused on the positive outcomes of trait emotional intelligence (TEI) preventing psychological disorders. However, the possibility that TEI might have a dark side has been neglected. Hence, this study aimed to explore the mediating effect of the three dimensions of TEI in the relationship between negative affect and anxiety symptoms among college students. Participants of this research were 467 undergraduates who completed an online self-reported questionnaire including the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson et al., 1988), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger et al., 1970), and Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24, Salovey et al., 1995). The global serial mediation model showed that the total amount of variance explained by the global model was 30.8% (",

    "abstract": "An efficient management and better scheduling by the power companies are of great significance for accurate electrical load forecasting. There exists a high level of uncertainties in the load time series, which is challenging to make the accurate short-term load forecast (STLF), medium-term load forecast (MTLF), and long-term load forecast (LTLF). To extract the local trends and to capture the same patterns of short, and medium forecasting time series, we proposed long short-term memory (LSTM), Multilayer perceptron, and convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the relationship in the time series. These models are proposed to improve the forecasting accuracy. The models were tested based on the real-world case by conducting detailed experiments to validate their stability and practicality. The performance was measured in terms of squared error, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To predict the next 24 hours ahead load forecasting, the lowest prediction error was obtained using LSTM with R2 (0.5160), MLP with MAPE (4.97), MAE (104.33) and RMSE (133.92). To predict the next 72 hours ahead of load forecasting, the lowest prediction error was obtained using LSTM with R2 (0.7153), MPL with MAPE (7.04), MAE (125.92), RMSE (188.33). Likewise, to predict the next one week ahead load forecasting, the lowest error was obtained using CNN with R2 (0.7616), MLP with MAPE (6.162), MAE (103.156), RMSE (150.81). Moreover, to predict the next one-month load forecasting, the lowest prediction error was obtained using CNN with R2 (0.820), MLP with MAPE (5.18), LSTM with MAE (75.12) and RMSE (109.197). The results reveal that proposed methods achieved better and stable performance for predicting the short, and medium-term load forecasting. The findings of the STLF indicate that the proposed model can be better implemented for local system planning and dispatch, while it will be more efficient for MTLF in better scheduling and maintenance operations.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized how we can use clinical, imaging, and molecular data to understand and model complex systems. AI has shown impressive results in areas related to automated clinical decision making, radiological interpretation and prognostication. The unique nature of COPD and the accessibility to well-phenotyped populations result in an ideal scenario for AI development. This review provides an introduction to AI and deep learning and presents some recent successes in applying AI in COPD. Finally, we will discuss some of the opportunities, challenges, and limitations for AI applications in the context of COPD.",

    "abstract": "Precision medicine informatics is a field of research that incorporates learning systems that generate new knowledge to improve individualized treatments using integrated data sets and models. Given the ever-increasing volumes of data that are relevant to patient care, artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines need to be a central component of such research to speed discovery. Applying AI methodology to complex multidisciplinary information retrieval can support efforts to discover bridging concepts within collaborating communities. This dovetails with precision medicine research, given the information rich multi-omic data that are used in precision medicine analysis pipelines. In this perspective article we define a prototype AI pipeline to facilitate discovering research connections between bioinformatics and clinical researchers. We propose building knowledge representations that are iteratively improved through AI and human-informed learning feedback loops supported through crowdsourcing. To illustrate this, we will explore the specific use case of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a growing health care problem. We will examine AI pipeline construction and utilization in relation to bench-to-bedside bridging concepts with interconnecting knowledge representations applicable to bioinformatics researchers and clinicians.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly explored in different domains of gastroenterology, particularly in endoscopic image analysis, cancer screening, and prognostication models. It is widely touted to become an integral part of routine endoscopies, considering the bulk of data handled by endoscopists and the complex nature of critical analyses performed. However, the application of AI in endoscopy in resource-constrained settings remains fraught with problems. We conducted an extensive literature review using the PubMed database on articles covering the application of AI in endoscopy and the difficulties encountered in resource-constrained settings. We have tried to summarize in the present review the potential problems that may hinder the application of AI in such settings. Hopefully, this review will enable endoscopists and health policymakers to ponder over these issues before trying to extrapolate the advancements of AI in technically advanced settings to those having constraints at multiple levels.

    "abstract": "Forensic DNA Phenotyping (FDP) is an established but evolving field of DNA testing. It provides intelligence regarding the appearance (externally visible characteristics), biogeographical ancestry and age of an unknown donor and, although not necessarily a requirement for its casework application, has been previously used as a method of last resort in New South Wales (NSW) Police Force investigations. FDP can further assist law enforcement agencies by re-prioritising an existing pool of suspects or generating a new pool of suspects. In recent years, this capability has become ubiquitous with a wide range of service providers offering their expertise to law enforcement and the public. With the increase in the number of providers offering FDP and its potential to direct and target law enforcement resources, a thorough assessment of the applicability of these services was undertaken. Six service providers of FDP were assessed for suitability for NSW Police Force casework based on prediction accuracy, clarity of reporting, limitations of testing, cost and turnaround times. From these assessment criteria, a service provider for the prediction of biogeographical ancestry, hair and eye colour was deemed suitable for use in NSW Police Force casework. Importantly, the study highlighted the need for standardisation of terminology and reporting in this evolving field, and the requirement for interpretation by biologists with specialist expertise to translate the scientific data to intelligence for police investigators.",

    "abstract": "The early clinical course of COVID-19 can be difficult to distinguish from other illnesses driving presentation to hospital. However, viral-specific PCR testing has limited sensitivity and results can take up to 72 h for operational reasons. We aimed to develop and validate two early-detection models for COVID-19, screening for the disease among patients attending the emergency department and the subset being admitted to hospital, using routinely collected health-care data (laboratory tests, blood gas measurements, and vital signs). These data are typically available within the first hour of presentation to hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries, within the existing laboratory infrastructure.\nWe trained linear and non-linear machine learning classifiers to distinguish patients with COVID-19 from pre-pandemic controls, using electronic health record data for patients presenting to the emergency department and admitted across a group of four teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK (Oxford University Hospitals). Data extracted included presentation blood tests, blood gas testing, vital signs, and results of PCR testing for respiratory viruses. Adult patients (>18 years) presenting to hospital before Dec 1, 2019 (before the first COVID-19 outbreak), were included in the COVID-19-negative cohort; those presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2019, and April 19, 2020, with PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included in the COVID-19-positive cohort. Patients who were subsequently admitted to hospital were included in their respective COVID-19-negative or COVID-19-positive admissions cohorts. Models were calibrated to sensitivities of 70%, 80%, and 90% during training, and performance was initially assessed on a held-out test set generated by an 80:20 split stratified by patients with COVID-19 and balanced equally with pre-pandemic controls. To simulate real-world performance at different stages of an epidemic, we generated test sets with varying prevalences of COVID-19 and assessed predictive values for our models. We prospectively validated our 80% sensitivity models for all patients presenting or admitted to the Oxford University Hospitals between April 20 and May 6, 2020, comparing model predictions with PCR test results.\nWe assessed 155\u2008689 adult patients presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2017, and April 19, 2020. 114\u2008957 patients were included in the COVID-negative cohort and 437 in the COVID-positive cohort, for a full study population of 115\u2008394 patients, with 72\u2008310 admitted to hospital. With a sensitive configuration of 80%, our emergency department (ED) model achieved 77\u00b74% sensitivity and 95\u00b77% specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0\u00b7939) for COVID-19 among all patients attending hospital, and the admissions model achieved 77\u00b74% sensitivity and 94\u00b78% specificity (AUROC 0\u00b7940) for the subset of patients admitted to hospital. Both models achieved high negative predictive values (NPV; >98\u00b75%) across a range of prevalences (\u22645%). We prospectively validated our models for all patients presenting and admitted to Oxford University Hospitals in a 2-week test period. The ED model (3326 patients) achieved 92\u00b73% accuracy (NPV 97\u00b76%, AUROC 0\u00b7881), and the admissions model (1715 patients) achieved 92\u00b75% accuracy (97\u00b77%, 0\u00b7871) in comparison with PCR results. Sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in negative PCR results improved apparent accuracy (ED model 95\u00b71%, admissions model 94\u00b71%) and NPV (ED model 99\u00b70%, admissions model 98\u00b75%).\nOur models performed effectively as a screening test for COVID-19, excluding the illness with high-confidence by use of clinical data routinely available within 1 h of presentation to hospital. Our approach is rapidly scalable, fitting within the existing laboratory testing infrastructure and standard of care of hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries.\nWellcome Trust, University of Oxford, Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning based approaches are increasingly finding their way into various areas of nuclear medicine imaging. With the technical development of new methods and the expansion to new fields of application, this trend is likely to become even more pronounced in future. Possible means of application range from automated image reading and classification to correlation with clinical outcomes and to technological applications in image processing and reconstruction. In the context of tumor imaging, that is, predominantly FDG or PSMA PET imaging but also bone scintigraphy, artificial intelligence approaches can be used to quantify the whole-body tumor volume, for the segmentation and classification of pathological foci or to facilitate the diagnosis of micro-metastases. More advanced applications aim at the correlation of image features that are derived by artificial intelligence with clinical endpoints, for example, whole-body tumor volume with overall survival. In nuclear medicine imaging of benign diseases, artificial intelligence methods are predominantly used for automated and/or facilitated image classification and clinical decision making. Automated feature selection, segmentation and classification of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy can help in identifying patients that would benefit from intervention and to forecast clinical prognosis. Automated reporting of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease might be extended to early diagnosis-being of special interest, if targeted treatment options might become available. Technological approaches include artificial intelligence-based attenuation correction of PET images, image reconstruction or anatomical landmarking. Attenuation correction is of special interest for avoiding the need of a coregistered CT scan, in the process of image reconstruction artefacts might be reduced, or ultra low-dose PET images might be denoised. The development of accurate ultra low-dose PET imaging might broaden the method's applicability, for example, toward oncologic PET screening. Most artificial intelligence approaches in nuclear medicine imaging are still in early stages of development, further improvements are necessary for broad clinical applications. In this review, we describe the current trends in the context fields of body oncology, cardiac imaging, and neuroimaging while an additional section puts emphasis on technological trends. Our aim is not only to describe currently available methods, but also to place a special focus on the description of possible future developments.",

    "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) are nuclear diagnostic imaging modalities that are routinely deployed for cancer staging and monitoring. They hold the advantage of detecting disease related biochemical and physiologic abnormalities in advance of anatomical changes, thus widely used for staging of disease progression, identification of the treatment gross tumor volume, monitoring of disease, as well as prediction of outcomes and personalization of treatment regimens. Among the arsenal of different functional imaging modalities, nuclear imaging has benefited from early adoption of quantitative image analysis starting from simple standard uptake value normalization to more advanced extraction of complex imaging uptake patterns; thanks to application of sophisticated image processing and machine learning algorithms. In this review, we discuss the application of image processing and machine/deep learning techniques to PET/CT imaging with special focus on the oncological radiotherapy domain as a case study and draw examples from our work and others to highlight current status and future potentials.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently attracted much attention for its potential use in healthcare applications. The use of AI to improve and extract more information out of medical images, given their parallels with natural images and the immense progress in the area of computer vision, has been at the forefront of these advances. This is due to a convergence of factors, including the increasing numbers of scans performed, the availability of open source AI tools, and decreases in the costs of hardware required to implement these technologies. In this article, we review the progress in the use of AI toward optimizing PET/CT and PET/MRI studies. These two methods, which combine molecular information with structural and (in the case of MRI) functional imaging, are extremely valuable for a wide range of clinical indications. They are also tremendously data-rich modalities and as such are highly amenable to data-driven technologies such as AI. The first half of the article will focus on methods to improve PET reconstruction and image quality, which has multiple benefits including faster image acquisition, image reconstruction, and lower or even \"zero\" radiation dose imaging. It will also address the value of AI-driven methods to perform MR-based attenuation correction. The second half will address how some of these advances can be used to perform to optimize diagnosis from the acquired images, with examples given for whole-body oncology, cardiology, and neurology indications. Overall, it is likely that the use of AI will markedly improve both the quality and safety of PET/CT and PET/MRI as well as enhance our ability to interpret the scans and follow lesions over time. This will hopefully lead to expanded clinical use cases for these valuable technologies leading to better patient care.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) in nuclear medicine has gained significant traction and promises to be a disruptive, but innovative, technology. Recent developments in artificial neural networks, machine learning, and deep learning have ignited debate with respect to ethical and legal challenges associated with the use of AI in healthcare and medicine. While AI in nuclear medicine has the potential to improve workflow and productivity, and enhance clinical and research capabilities, there remains a professional responsibility to the profession and to patients: ethical, social, and legal. Enthusiasm to embrace new technology should not displace responsibilities for the ethical, social, and legal application of technology. This is especially true in relation to data usage, the algorithms applied, and how algorithms are used in practice. Governance of software and algorithms used for detection (segmentation) and/or diagnosis (classification) of disease using medical images requires rigorous evidence-based regulation. A number of frameworks have been developed for ethical application of AI generally in society and in radiology. For nuclear medicine, consideration needs to be given to beneficence, nonmaleficence, fairness and justice, safety, reliability, data security, privacy and confidentiality, mitigation of bias, transparency, explainability, and autonomy. AI is merely a tool, how it is utilised is a human choice. There is potential for AI applications to enhance clinical and research practice in nuclear medicine and concurrently produce deeper, more meaningful interactions between the physicians and the patient. Nonetheless ethical, legal, and social challenges demand careful attention and formulation of standards/guidelines for nuclear medicine.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in nuclear medicine has occurred over the last 50 years but more recent developments in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have driven new capabilities of AI in nuclear medicine. In nuclear medicine, the artificial neural network (ANN) is the backbone of ML and DL. The inputs may be radiomic features that have been extracted from the image files or, if using a convolutional neural network (CNN), may be the images themselves. AI in nuclear medicine re-engineers and re-imagines clinical and research capabilities. An understanding of the principles of AI, ML and DL contextualised to nuclear medicine allows richer engagement in clinical and research applications, and capacity for problem solving where required. Simple applications of ML include quality assurance, risk assessment, business analytics and rudimentary classifications. More complex applications of DL for detection, localisation, classification, segmentation, quantitation and radiomic feature extraction using CNNs can be applied to general nuclear medicine, SPECT, PET, CT and MRI. There are also applications of ANNs and ML that allow small datasets (and larger ones) to be analysed in parallel to conventional statistical analysis. AI has assimilated into the clinical and research practice of nuclear medicine with little disruption. The emergence of ML and DL applications, however, has produced a seismic significant shift in the clinical and research landscape that demands at least rudimentary understanding of the principles of AI, ANNs and CNNs among nuclear medicine professionals.",

    "abstract": "The study of sustainability challenges requires the consideration of multiple coupled systems that are often complex and deeply uncertain. As a result, traditional analytical methods offer limited insights with respect to how to best address such challenges. By analyzing the case of global climate change mitigation, this paper shows that the combination of high-performance computing, mathematical modeling, and computational intelligence tools, such as optimization and clustering algorithms, leads to richer analytical insights. The paper concludes by proposing an analytical hierarchy of computational tools that can be applied to other sustainability challenges.",

    "abstract": "Although patient intelligence may be an important determinant of the degree to which individuals may comprehend, comply with, and ultimately benefit from trauma-focused treatment, no prior studies have examined the impact of patient intelligence on benefit from psychotherapies for PTSD. We investigated the degree to which educational achievement, often used as a proxy for intelligence, and estimated full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) scores themselves moderated treatment outcomes for two effective psychotherapies for PTSD: Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Written Exposure Therapy (WET). Participants, 126 treatment-seeking adults with PTSD (52% male; mean age = 43.9, SD = 14.6), were equally randomized to CPT and WET; PTSD symptom severity was measured at baseline and 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, and 60-weeks following the first treatment session. Multilevel models revealed that participants with higher FSIQ scores experienced significantly greater PTSD symptom reduction through the 24-week assessment in CPT but not WET; this effect did not persist through the 60-week assessment. Educational achievement did not moderate symptom change through either 24- or 60-weeks. Individuals with higher FSIQ who are treated with CPT may experience greater symptom improvement in the early stages of recovery.",

    "abstract": "The clinical severity, rapid transmission and human losses due to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have led the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic. Traditional epidemiological tools are being significantly complemented by recent innovations especially using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. AI-based model systems could improve pattern recognition of disease spread in populations and predictions of outbreaks in different geographical locations. A variable and a minimal amount of data are available for the signs and symptoms of Covid-19, allowing a composite of maximum likelihood algorithms to be employed to enhance the accuracy of disease diagnosis and to identify potential drugs. AI-based forecasting and predictions are expected to complement traditional approaches by helping public health officials to select better response and preparedness measures against Covid-19 cases. AI-based approaches have helped address the key issues but a significant impact on the global healthcare industry is yet to be achieved. The capability of AI to address the challenges may make it a key player in the operation of healthcare systems in future. Here, we present an overview of the prospective applications of the AI model systems in healthcare settings during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "To compare the impact of trait emotional intelligence between students of different faculties and associated factors.\nThe cross-sectional analytical study was conducted from August 2016 to March 2017 at the University of Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan, and comprised undergraduate students, both boarders and day scholars, from seven different faculties. Data was collected using the trait emotional intelligence questionnaire-short form. Student's yearly test scores were obtained as a measure of academic achievement. Data was analysed using SPSS 20.\nOf the 498 students, 109(21.9%) were studying medicine, 56(11.2%) dental sciences, 76(15.2%) optometry, 83(16.6%) nutrition and dietetics, 109(21.9%) physiotherapy, 35(7%) pharmacy, and 30(6%) social sciences. The overall mean age was 19.84\u00b11.30 years. There were 210(42.2%) boarders compared to 288(57.8%) day scholars. There was significant difference in emotional intelligence based on student's faculty (p<0.0001). Significant impact was seen on test scores of faculty residing status (p<0.05). Significant relation of emotional quotient and residing status with student's test scores (p<0.05).\nEmotional intelligence was found to be an important factor in academic achievement and important variable in different faculties and different living conditions.",

Therefore, modeling and predicting water quality have become very important in controlling water pollution. In this work, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are developed to predict water quality index (WQI) and water quality classification (WQC). For the WQI prediction, artificial neural network models, namely nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARNET) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithm, have been developed. In addition, three machine learning algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), ",

Here, chemical similarity based machine learning and label-free differential scanning fluorimetry were used to rapidly identify new ligands of the anticancer target Pim-1 kinase. The three-dimensional crystal structure complex of human Pim-1 with ligand bound revealed an ATP-competitive binding mode. Generative de novo design with a recurrent neural network additionally suggested innovative molecular scaffolds. Results corroborate the validity of the chemical similarity principle for rapid ligand prototyping, suggesting the complementarity of similarity-based and generative computational approaches.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently achieved considerable success in different domains including medical applications. Although current advances are expected to impact surgery, up until now AI has not been able to leverage its full potential due to several challenges that are specific to that field.\nThis review summarizes data-driven methods and technologies needed as a prerequisite for different AI-based assistance functions in the operating room. Potential effects of AI usage in surgery will be highlighted, concluding with ongoing challenges to enabling AI for surgery.\nAI-assisted surgery will enable data-driven decision-making via decision support systems and cognitive robotic assistance. The use of AI for workflow analysis will help provide appropriate assistance in the right context. The requirements for such assistance must be defined by surgeons in close cooperation with computer scientists and engineers. Once the existing challenges will have been solved, AI assistance has the potential to improve patient care by supporting the surgeon without replacing him or her.",

    "abstract": "In the past, image-based computer-assisted diagnosis and detection systems have been driven mainly from the field of radiology, and more specifically mammography. Nevertheless, with the availability of large image data collections (known as the \"Big Data\" phenomenon) in correlation with developments from the domain of artificial intelligence (AI) and particularly so-called deep convolutional neural networks, computer-assisted detection of adenomas and polyps in real-time during screening colonoscopy has become feasible.\nWith respect to these developments, the scope of this contribution is to provide a brief overview about the evolution of AI-based detection of adenomas and polyps during colonoscopy of the past 35 years, starting with the age of \"handcrafted geometrical features\" together with simple classification schemes, over the development and use of \"texture-based features\" and machine learning approaches, and ending with current developments in the field of deep learning using convolutional neural networks. In parallel, the need and necessity of large-scale clinical data will be discussed in order to develop such methods, up to commercially available AI products for automated detection of polyps (adenoma and benign neoplastic lesions). Finally, a short view into the future is made regarding further possibilities of AI methods within colonoscopy.\nResearch of image-based lesion detection in colonoscopy data has a 35-year-old history. Milestones such as the Paris nomenclature, texture features, big data, and deep learning were essential for the development and availability of commercial AI-based systems for polyp detection.",

However, wide clinical adoption remains far off. This review reflects on common barriers and current solution approaches.\nKey challenges are abbreviated as the RISE criteria: Regulatory aspects, Interpretability, interoperability, and the need for Structured data and Evidence. As reoccurring barriers of AI adoption, these concepts are delineated and complemented by points to consider and possible solutions for effective and safe use of AI applications.\nThere is a fraction of AI applications with proven clinical benefits and regulatory approval. Many new promising systems are the subject of current research but share common issues for wide clinical adoption. The RISE criteria can support preparation for challenges and pitfalls when designing or introducing AI applications into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The respiration rate (RR) is the most vital parameter used for the determination of human health. The most widely adopted techniques, used to monitor the RR are contact in nature and face many drawbacks. This paper reports the use of Infrared Thermography, in reliably monitoring the RR in a contact-less and non-invasive way. A thermal camera is used to monitor the variation in nasal temperature during respiration continuously. Further, the nostrils (region of interest) are tracked during head motion and object occlusion, by implementing a computer vision algorithm that makes use of 'Histogram of oriented gradients' and 'Support vector machine' (SVM). The signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the acquired breathing signals is very low; hence they are subjected to appropriate filtering methods. The filters are compared depending on the performance metrics such as SNR and Mean square error. The breaths per minute are obtained without any manual intervention by implementing the 'Breath detection algorithm' (BDA). This algorithm is implemented on 150 breathing signals and its performance is determined by computing the parameters such as Precision, Sensitivity, Spurious cycle rate, and Missed cycle rate values, obtained as 98.6%, 97.2%, 1.4%, and 2.8% respectively. The parameters obtained from the BDA are fed to the k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) and SVM classifiers, that determine whether the human volunteers have abnormal or normal respiration, or have Bradypnea (slow breathing), or Tachypnea (fast breathing). The Validation accuracies obtained are 96.25% and 99.5% with Training accuracies 97.75% and 99.4% for SVM and k-NN classifiers respectively. The Testing accuracies of the completely built SVM and k-NN classifiers are 96% and 99%, respectively. The various performance metrics like Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, G-mean and F-measure are calculated as well, for every class, for both the classifiers. Finally, the Standard deviation values of the SVM and k-NN classifiers are computed and are obtained as 0.022 and 0.007, respectively. It is observed that the k-NN classifier shows a better performance compared to the SVM classifier. The pattern between the data points fed to the classifiers is viewed by making use of the t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding algorithm. It is noticed from these plots that the separation between the data points belonging to different classes, improves and shows minimal overlap by increasing the perplexity value and number of iterations.",

    "abstract": "Although breast ultrasonography is the mainstay modality for differentiating between benign and malignant breast masses, it has intrinsic problems with false positives and substantial interobserver variability. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly with deep learning models, is expected to improve workflow efficiency and serve as a second opinion. AI is highly useful for performing three main clinical tasks in breast ultrasonography: detection (localization/ segmentation), differential diagnosis (classification), and prognostication (prediction). This article provides a current overview of AI applications in breast ultrasonography, with a discussion of methodological considerations in the development of AI models and an up-to-date literature review of potential clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is one of the most reliable methods to analyse the cardiovascular system. In the literature, there are different deep learning architectures proposed to detect various types of tachycardia diseases, such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, and sinus tachycardia. Even though all types of tachycardia diseases have fast beat rhythm as the common characteristic feature, existing deep learning architectures are trained with the corresponding disease-specific features. Most of the proposed works lack the interpretation and understanding of the results obtained. Hence, the objective of this letter is to explore the features learned by the deep learning models. For the detection of the different types of tachycardia diseases, the authors used a transfer learning approach. In this method, the model is trained with one of the tachycardia diseases called atrial fibrillation and tested with other tachycardia diseases, such as ventricular fibrillation and sinus tachycardia. The analysis was done using different deep learning models, such as RNN, LSTM, GRU, CNN, and RSCNN. RNN achieved an accuracy of 96.47% for atrial fibrillation data set, 90.88% accuracy for CU-ventricular tachycardia data set, and also achieved an accuracy of 94.71, and 94.18% for MIT-BIH malignant ventricular ectopy database for ECG lead I and lead II, respectively. The RNN model could only achieve an accuracy of 23.73% for the sinus tachycardia data set. A similar trend is shown by other models. From the analysis, it was evident that even though tachycardia diseases have fast beat rhythm as their common feature, the model was not able to detect different types of tachycardia diseases. The deep learning model could only detect atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation and failed in the case of sinus tachycardia. From the analysis, they were able to interpret that, along with the fast beat rhythm, the model has learned the absence of P-wave which is a common feature for ventricular fibrillation and atrial fibrillation but sinus tachycardia disease has an upright positive P-wave. The time-based analysis is conducted to find the time complexity of the models. The analysis conveyed that RNN and RSCNN models could achieve better performance with lesser time complexity.",

    "abstract": "Understanding video files is a challenging task. While the current video understanding techniques rely on deep learning, the obtained results suffer from a lack of real trustful meaning. Deep learning recognizes patterns from big data, leading to deep feature abstraction, not deep understanding. Deep learning tries to understand multimedia production by analyzing its content. We cannot understand the semantics of a multimedia file by analyzing its content only. Events occurring in a scene earn their meanings from the context containing them. A screaming kid could be scared of a threat or surprised by a lovely gift or just playing in the backyard. Artificial intelligence is a heterogeneous process that goes beyond learning. In this article, we discuss the heterogeneity of AI as a process that includes innate knowledge, approximations, and context awareness. We present a context-aware video understanding technique that makes the machine intelligent enough to understand the message behind the video stream. The main purpose is to understand the video stream by extracting real meaningful concepts, emotions, temporal data, and spatial data from the video context. The diffusion of heterogeneous data patterns from the video context leads to accurate decision-making about the video message and outperforms systems that rely on deep learning. Objective and subjective comparisons prove the accuracy of the concepts extracted by the proposed context-aware technique in comparison with the current deep learning video understanding techniques. Both systems are compared in terms of retrieval time, computing time, data size consumption, and complexity analysis. Comparisons show a significant efficient resource usage of the proposed context-aware system, which makes it a suitable solution for real-time scenarios. Moreover, we discuss the pros and cons of deep learning architectures.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this research was to develop a simple, cost-effective, but enough efficient solution for locating, tracking and distribution analysis of people and/or vehicle flowing, based on non-intrusive Bluetooth sensing and selective filtering algorithms employing artificial intelligence components. The solution provides a tool for analyzing density of targets in a specific area, useful when checking contact proximities of a target along a route. The principle consists of the detection of mobile devices that use active Bluetooth connections, such as personal notebooks, smartphones, smartwatches, Bluetooth headphones, etc. to locate and track their movement in the dedicated area. For this purpose, a specific configuration of three BT sensors is used and RSSI levels compared, based on a combination of differential location estimates. The solution may also be suited for indoor localization where GPS signals are usually weak or missing; for example, in public places such as subway stations or trains, hospitals, airport terminals and so on. The applicability of this solution is estimated to be vast, ranging from travel and transport information services, route guidance, passenger flows tracking, and path recovery for persons suspected to have SARS-COV2 or other contagious viruses, serving epidemiologic enquiries. The specific configuration of Bluetooth detectors may be installed either in a fixed location, or in a public transport vehicle. A set of filters and algorithms for triangulation-based location of detected targets and movement tracking, based on artificial intelligence is employed. When applied in the public transport field, this setup can be also developed to extract additional information on traffic, such as private traffic flowing, or passenger movement patterns along the vehicle route, improved location in absence of GPS signals, etc. Field tests have been carried out for determining different aspects concerning indoor location accuracy, reliability, selection of targets and filtering. Results and possible applications are also presented in the final section of the paper.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence skills in students may be related with physical and mental health, within and outside the academic field. Strengthening these skills can lead to greater overall well-being, lower use of substances, and improved academic performance, as well as reduced aggressive behaviours. The objective of this study was to analyse the levels of emotional intelligence (differentiating between the dimensions: emotional Attention, Clarity, and Repair) among high school students and examine its relationship with academic performance and emotional well-being, considering if there are differences between boys and girls and between different grades. A cross-sectional descriptive study was developed on a sample of 333 High School students using the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS) and KIDSCREEN-10 Index tools. Differences in emotional intelligence were observed between boys and girls for the three dimensions, and a relationship between emotional intelligence and student well-being was appreciated. No relationships were found between emotional intelligence and academic performance, nor have any differences been observed between the different courses analysed. It cannot be concluded that academic performance is related to emotional intelligence, but a relationship between well-being and emotional intelligence is found.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented situation where sudden and prolonged surges of critically ill patients have disrupted healthcare systems worldwide A major concern for hospitals worldwide is how to best manage large numbers of COVID-19 infected and non-infected patients, while still maintaining high-quality clinical care.\nThis manuscript describes the system development, collaborative efforts and the challenges encountered in developing an in-house clinical intelligence dashboard.\nThrough a longitudinal, interdepartmental collaboration, a COVID-19 clinical intelligence dashboard was created using Microsoft Power BI and Cerner Computer Language (CCL) to demonstrate clinical severity of patients and patient location in a single screen. A color-coding schema was applied to produce a red highlight for patients whose condition is deteriorating, whether due to increasing oxygen demand or worsening laboratory values. An additional function enabled users to drill down into the patient's clinical and laboratory parameters for the past 5 days, and ultimately to the respective patient chart for further assessment.\nThe development of an in-house clinical intelligence dashboard is a feasible, effective tool to allow frontline clinicians to monitor patient status in multiple wards and proactively intervene as clinically necessary and transfer patients to the appropriate level of care. Comparing the 30 days before and 30 days after the implementation of the dashboard, the percentage of patients who required urgent intubation or cardiac resuscitation on the general medical ward, rather than a critical care setting, declined by over 50% (8 out of 34, 33% vs. 7 out of 55, 13%; two-tailed p < 0.05 by Fisher's exact test; OR 3.43; CI 1.07 to 10.95).\nThe dashboard has enabled physicians to efficiently assess patient volumes and case severity to prioritize clinical care and appropriately allocate scarce resources. The dashboard can be replicated by developing healthcare systems that are continuing to grapple with the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Given the current pandemic, differentiation between pneumonia induced by COVID-19 or influenza viruses is of utmost clinical significance in the patients' management. For this purpose, this study was conducted to develop sensitive artificial intelligence (AI) models to assist radiologists to decisively differentiate pneumonia due to COVID-19 versus influenza viruses.\nCross sectional chest CT images (N=12744) from well-evaluated cases of pneumonias induced by COVID-19 or H1N1 Influenza viruses, and normal individuals were collected. We examined the computer tomographic (CT) chest images from 137 individuals. Various pre-trained convolutional neural network models, such as ResNet-50, InceptionV3, Wide ResNet, SqueezNet, VGG 16 and VGG 19 were fine-tuned on our datasets. The datasets were used for training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) of the final models.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the process of scientific research. AI, coupled with availability of large datasets and increasing computational power, is accelerating progress in areas such as genetics, climate change and astronomy [NeurIPS 2019 Workshop Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada; Hausen R, Robertson BE. Morpheus: A deep learning framework for the pixel-level analysis of astronomical image data. Astrophys J Suppl Ser. 2020;248:20; Dias R, Torkamani A. AI in clinical and genomic diagnostics. Genome Med. 2019;11:70.]. The application of AI in behavioral science is still in its infancy and realizing the promise of AI requires adapting current practices.\nBy using AI to synthesize and interpret behavior change intervention evaluation report findings at a scale beyond human capability, the HBCP seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of research activities. We explore challenges facing AI adoption in behavioral science through the lens of lessons learned during the Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP).\nThe project used an iterative cycle of development and testing of AI algorithms. Using a corpus of published research reports of randomized controlled trials of behavioral interventions, behavioral science experts annotated occurrences of interventions and outcomes. AI algorithms were trained to recognize natural language patterns associated with interventions and outcomes from the expert human annotations. Once trained, the AI algorithms were used to predict outcomes for interventions that were checked by behavioral scientists.\nIntervention reports contain many items of information needing to be extracted and these are expressed in hugely variable and idiosyncratic language used in research reports to convey information makes developing algorithms to extract all the information with near perfect accuracy impractical. However, statistical matching algorithms combined with advanced machine learning approaches created reasonably accurate outcome predictions from incomplete data.\nAI holds promise for achieving the goal of predicting outcomes of behavior change interventions, based on information that is automatically extracted from intervention evaluation reports. This information can be used to train knowledge systems using machine learning and reasoning algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Psychological well-being is a key aspect of mental health. However, it is the focus of few studies among the deaf population. The present study explored the possible relationship between emotional intelligence and psychological well-being in a sample of 146 deaf Spanish adults compared to 146 typically hearing controls. The influence of anxiety, depression, and alexithymia was also assessed. Significant differences were found between deaf and hearing participants regarding anxiety, depression, alexithymia, and psychological well-being. No differences were found between deaf and typically hearing participants regarding emotional functioning. Mediational analysis showed that emotional intelligence significantly predicted psychological wellbeing both directly, and also indirectly through depression. Effects of anxiety and alexithymia were not significant. Differences observed between deaf and typically hearing participants regarding psychological well-being are discussed in terms of greater depression rates among the former. Deaf participants' intragroup differences are also discussed.",

In 2020 it seems that there is an AI for just about every aspect of life - from targeted advertising to minimally invasive surgery. It is generally thought that advancements in AI lead to advancements in human life. However, AI is an unprecedented form of technology with the ability to exceed human expectation and act in unexpected manners. This article considers the intersection between AI and bioinformatics with a particular focus on how artificial capabilities may affect the individual's right to privacy. A further question is raised as to whether current Australian laws are equipped to protect the individual's right to privacy, in light of artificial capabilities.",

It is increasingly used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of multifarious processes in private industry and public administration. Among the statutory authorities that have begun to explore the potential for AI to assist them are regulators of Australia's health professions. Protection of the public is a chief objective of this area of administrative law. This section considers some possible uses of AI - and particularly its capacities to analyse and draw inferences from data, make predictions and decisions, and automate tasks - that might help regulators achieve this goal. The section also contemplates the implications of AI involvement in the regulation of health practitioners for the rule of law and human rights it protects and recommends measures that might be taken to mitigate risks of their infringement.",

    "abstract": "The long-term success of organizations is mainly attributable to employees' psychological health. Organizations focusing on promoting and managing the flow (an optimal experience and optimal functioning state) may enhance employees' well-being and performance to an optimum level. Surprisingly, the literature representing the role of HRM practices for their effect on work-related flow (i.e., intrinsic motivation, absorption, and work enjoyment) is very sparse. Accordingly, by drawing primarily on the job demands-resources model and HRM specific attribution theory, this paper develops a theoretical framework that unravels the effectiveness of specific organizational level High Involvement HRM (HIHRM) practices (i.e., recognition, empowerment, information sharing, fair rewards, and competence development) in activating the individual level work-related flow with beneficial effect and mediating role of affective commitment. In addition to highlighting the underlying mechanisms that may cause HIHRM practices to be regarded as resources and sometimes as demands, this paper especially proposes that these practices implemented with a focus to promote employee well-being are perceived as job resources and may positively influence affective commitment and flow, whereas these practices used as a demand to increase performance are perceived as job demands and may hinder affective commitment and flow. It is further significant to understand the possible moderating effects of emotional intelligence on the relationships among HIHRM practices, affective commitment, and flow. The paper augments the knowledge and understanding of the impact process of HIHRM practices, in particular how the HIHRM effect is sensed by the workers and thus, influences their succeeding job attitude and work experience. Finally, this work, as the first paper to link HIHRM practices with work-related flow, promotes the concept of positive psychology in the workplace.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a common factor in neurodegenerative diseases, and it has been demonstrated that galectin-3 activates microglia and astrocytes, leading to inflammation. This means that inhibition of galectin-3 may become a new strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Based on this motivation, the objective of this study is to explore an integrated new approach for finding lead compounds that inhibit galectin-3, by combining universal artificial intelligence algorithms with traditional drug screening methods. Based on molecular docking method, potential compounds with high binding affinity were screened out from Chinese medicine database. Manifold artificial intelligence algorithms were performed to validate the docking results and further screen compounds. Among all involved predictive methods, the deep learning-based algorithm made 500 modeling attempts, and the square correlation coefficient of the best trained model on the test sets was 0.9. The XGBoost model reached a square correlation coefficient of 0.97 and a mean square error of only 0.01. We switched to the ZINC database and performed the same experiment, the results showed that the compounds in the former database showed stronger affinity. Finally, we further verified through molecular dynamics simulation that the complex composed of the candidate ligand and the target protein showed stable binding within 100 ns of simulation time. In summary, combined with the application based on artificial intelligence algorithms, we unearthed the active ingredients 1,2-Dimethylbenzene and Typhic acid contained in ",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 has a profound impact on people with existing mental disorders, augmenting the prevailing inequalities in mental health.\nIn order to understand the status of telepsychiatry in India and the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in mental health and its potential applications, a scoping review was done between March 2020 and May 2020. The literature review revealed 253 papers, which were used to derive the primary framework for analysis. The information was then reviewed for ideas and concepts, which were integrated with evidence from gray literature and categorized under broader themes based on the insights derived. Finally, a thematic framework was developed for discussion to tailor scientific information for decision-makers' needs.\nReview findings are summarized under the following headings: changing patterns of health-seeking behavior, origin and evolution of telepsychiatry, possible applications of telepsychiatry and AI, technological features, and AI models in mental health.\nThough there are several potential opportunities, the time is not yet ripe for telepsychiatry and AI to be adopted fully in the field of mental health care. But it is time that we develop indigenous proprietary technology and test and validate it. With many solutions offered by telepsychiatry and AI, psychiatrists must choose an appropriate tool based on their requirements, availability of resources, and feasibility of deployment. Harmony between conventional care and technology-based care must be reached gradually.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) facilitate the development of AI-powered medical imaging including ultrasonography (US). However, overlooking or misdiagnosis of malignant lesions may result in serious consequences; the introduction of AI to the imaging modalities may be an ideal solution to prevent human error. For the development of AI for medical imaging, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of modalities on the context of task setting, required data sets, suitable AI algorism, and expected performance with clinical impact. Regarding the AI-aided US diagnosis, several attempts have been made to construct an image database and develop an AI-aided diagnosis system in the field of oncology. Regarding the diagnosis of liver tumors using US images, 4- or 5-class classifications, including the discrimination of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), metastatic tumors, hemangiomas, liver cysts, and focal nodular hyperplasia, have been reported using AI. Combination of radiomic approach with AI is also becoming a powerful tool for predicting the outcome in patients with HCC after treatment, indicating the potential of AI for applying personalized medical care. However, US images show high heterogeneity because of differences in conditions during the examination, and a variety of imaging parameters may affect the quality of images; such conditions may hamper the development of US-based AI. In this review, we summarized the development of AI in medical images with challenges to task setting, data curation, and focus on the application of AI for the managements of liver tumor, especially for US diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) simulates intelligent behavior as well as critical thinking comparable to a human being and can be used to analyze and interpret complex medical data. The application of AI in imaging diagnostics reduces the burden of radiologists and increases the sensitivity of lung cancer screening so that the morbidity and mortality associated with lung cancer can be decreased. In this article, we have tried to evaluate the role of artificial intelligence in lung cancer screening, as well as the future potential and efficiency of AI in the classification of nodules. The relevant studies between 2010-2020 were selected from the PubMed database after excluding animal studies and were analyzed for the contribution of AI. Techniques such as deep learning and machine learning allow automatic characterization and classification of nodules with high precision and promise an advanced lung cancer screening method in the future. Even though several combination models with high performance have been proposed, an effectively validated model for routine use still needs to be improvised. Combining the performance of artificial intelligence with a radiologist's expertise offers a successful outcome with higher accuracy. Thus, we can conclude that higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of lung cancer screening and classification of nodules is possible through the integration of artificial intelligence and radiology. The validation of models and further research is to be carried out to determine the feasibility of this integration.",

    "abstract": "This theoretical article proposes a unified framework of analysis for the constructs of intelligence and creativity. General definitions for intelligence and creativity are provided, allowing fair comparisons between the two context-embedded constructs. A novel taxonomy is introduced to classify the contexts in which intelligent and/or creative behavior can be embedded, in terms of the tightness vs. looseness of the relevant conceptual space S and available time T. These two dimensions are used to form what is identified as the space-time continuum, containing four quadrants: tight space and tight time, loose space and tight time, tight space and loose time, loose space and loose time. The intelligence and creativity constructs can be mapped onto the four quadrants and found to overlap more or less, depending on the context characteristics. Measurement methodologies adapted to the four different quadrants are discussed. The article concludes with a discussion about future research directions based on the proposed theoretical framework, in terms of theories and hypotheses on intelligence and creativity, of eminent personalities and personality traits, as well as its consequences for developmental, educational, and professional environments.",

    "abstract": "Planning for mass vaccination against SARS-Cov-2 is ongoing in many countries considering that vaccine will be available for the general public in the near future. Rapid mass vaccination while a pandemic is ongoing requires the use of traditional and new temporary vaccination clinics. Use of drive-through has been suggested as one of the possible effective temporary mass vaccinations among other methods. In this study, we present a machine learning model that has been developed based on a big dataset derived from 125K runs of a drive-through mass vaccination simulation tool. The results show that the model is able to reasonably well predict the key outputs of the simulation tool. Therefore, the model has been turned to an online application that can help mass vaccination planners to assess the outcomes of different types of drive-through mass vaccination facilities much faster.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effect of an artificial intelligence (AI) support system on breast ultrasound diagnostic accuracy.In this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant, institutional review board-approved retrospective study, 200 lesions (155 benign, 45 malignant) were randomly selected from consecutive ultrasound-guided biopsies (June 2017-January 2019). Two readers, blinded to clinical history and pathology, evaluated lesions with and without an Food and Drug Administration-approved AI software. Lesion features, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) rating (1-5), reader confidence level (1-5), and AI BI-RADS equivalent (1-5) were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed for diagnostic accuracy, negative predictive value, positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and specificity of reader versus AI BI-RADS. Generalized estimating equation analysis was used for reader versus AI accuracy regarding lesion features and AI impact on low-confidence score lesions. Artificial intelligence effect on false-positive biopsy rate was determined. Statistical tests were conducted at a 2-sided 5% significance level.There was no significant difference in accuracy (73 vs 69.8%), negative predictive value (100% vs 98.5%), PPV (45.5 vs 42.4%), sensitivity (100% vs 96.7%), and specificity (65.2 vs 61.9; P = 0.118-0.409) for AI versus pooled reader assessment. Artificial intelligence was more accurate than readers for irregular shape (74.1% vs 57.4%, P = 0.002) and less accurate for round shape (26.5% vs 50.0%, P = 0.049). Artificial intelligence improved diagnostic accuracy for reader-rated low-confidence lesions with increased PPV (24.7% AI vs 19.3%, P = 0.004) and specificity (57.8% vs 44.6%, P = 0.008).Artificial intelligence decision support aid may help improve sonographic diagnostic accuracy, particularly in cases with low reader confidence, thereby decreasing false-positives.",

    "abstract": "Despite the growing investment in and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine, the applications of AI in an emergency setting remain unclear. This scoping review seeks to identify available literature regarding the applications of AI in emergency medicine.\nThe scoping review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for scoping reviews using Medline-OVID, EMBASE, CINAHL, and IEEE, with a double screening and extraction process. The search included articles published until February 28, 2020. Articles were excluded if they did not self-classify as studying an AI intervention, were not relevant to the emergency department (ED), or did not report outcomes or evaluation.\nOf the 1483 original database citations, 395 were eligible for full-text evaluation. Of these articles, a total of 150 were included in the scoping review. The majority of included studies were retrospective in nature (n = 124, 82.7%), with only 3 (2.0%) prospective controlled trials. We found 37 (24.7%) interventions aimed at improving diagnosis within the ED. Among the 150 studies, 19 (12.7%) focused on diagnostic imaging within the ED. A total of 16 (10.7%) studies were conducted in the out-of-hospital environment (eg, emergency medical services, paramedics) with the remainder occurring either in the ED or the trauma bay. Of the 24 (16%) studies that had human comparators, there were 12 (8%) studies in which AI interventions outperformed clinicians in at least 1 measured outcome.\nAI-related research is rapidly increasing in emergency medicine. There are several promising AI interventions that can improve emergency care, particularly for acute radiographic imaging and prediction-based diagnoses. Higher quality evidence is needed to further assess both short- and long-term clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has inspired new innovations in diagnosing, treating, and dispositioning patients during high census conditions with constrained resources. Our objective is to describe first experiences of physician interaction with a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm designed to enhance physician abilities to identify ground-glass opacities and consolidation on chest radiographs.\nDuring the first wave of the pandemic, we deployed a previously developed and validated deep-learning AI algorithm for assisted interpretation of chest radiographs for use by physicians at an academic health system in Southern California. The algorithm overlays radiographs with \"heat\" maps that indicate pneumonia probability alongside standard chest radiographs at the point of care. Physicians were surveyed in real time regarding ease of use and impact on clinical decisionmaking.\nOf the 5125 total visits and 1960 chest radiographs obtained in the emergency department (ED) during the study period, 1855 were analyzed by the algorithm. Among these, emergency physicians were surveyed for their experiences on 202 radiographs. Overall, 86% either strongly agreed or somewhat agreed that the intervention was easy to use in their workflow. Of the respondents, 20% reported that the algorithm impacted clinical decisionmaking.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first published literature evaluating the impact of medical imaging AI on clinical decisionmaking in the emergency department setting. Urgent deployment of a previously validated AI algorithm clinically was easy to use and was found to have an impact on clinical decision making during the predicted surge period of a global pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of tumor metastasis is crucial for clinical treatment. Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great promise in the field of medicine. We therefore aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of AI algorithms in detecting tumor metastasis using medical radiology imaging.\nWe searched PubMed and Web of Science for studies published from January 1, 1997, to January 30, 2020. Studies evaluating an AI model for the diagnosis of tumor metastasis from medical images were included. We excluded studies that used histopathology images or medical wave-form data and those focused on the region segmentation of interest. Studies providing enough information to construct contingency tables were included in a meta-analysis.\nWe identified 2620 studies, of which 69 were included. Among them, 34 studies were included in a meta-analysis with a pooled sensitivity of 82% (95% CI 79-84%), specificity of 84% (82-87%) and AUC of 0\u00b790 (0\u00b787-0\u00b792). Analysis for different AI algorithms showed a pooled sensitivity of 87% (83-90%) for machine learning and 86% (82-89%) for deep learning, and a pooled specificity of 89% (82-93%) for machine learning, and 87% (82-91%) for deep learning.\nAI algorithms may be used for the diagnosis of tumor metastasis using medical radiology imaging with equivalent or even better performance to health-care professionals, in terms of sensitivity and specificity. At the same time, rigorous reporting standards with external validation and comparison to health-care professionals are urgently needed for AI application in the medical field.\nCollege students' innovative entrepreneurial training plan program .",

    "abstract": "To establish albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade-based and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) grade-based nomograms, as well as to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model to compare the prognostic performance and discrimination of these two grades for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with sorafenib as an initial treatment.\nThis multicenter retrospective study included patients from three hospitals between January 2013 and August 2018. In the training cohort, independent risk factors associated with overall survival (OS) were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses. The nomograms and ANN were established and then validated in two validation cohorts.\nA total of 504 patients (319, 61, and 124 patients from hospitals A, B, and C, respectively) were included. The median OS was 15.2, 26.9, and 14.8 months in the training cohort and validation cohorts 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.218). In the training cohort, both ALBI grade and CTP grade were identified as independent risk factors. The ALBI grade-based and CTP grade-based nomograms were established separately and showed similar prognostic performance and discrimination when validated in the validation cohorts (C-index in validation cohort 1: 0.799 vs. 0.779, P = 0.762; in validation cohort 2: 0.700 vs. 0.693, P = 0.803). The ANN model showed that the ALBI grade had higher importance in survival prediction than the CTP grade.\nThe ALBI grade and CTP grade have comparable prognostic performance for HCC patients treated with TACE combined with sorafenib. ALBI grades 1 and 2 have the potential to act as a stratification factor for clinical trials on the combination therapy of TACE and systemic therapy.",

    "abstract": "In the last decades, interest in the study of the negative consequences of bullying for the victims has increased. Victims are often known to show emotional adjustment issues, such as negative self-concept and low life satisfaction. Moreover, some studies have observed important associations between self-concept and life satisfaction, in which a positive self-concept is related to high levels of life satisfaction. Other studies have pointed out the importance of emotional intelligence (EI), as a regulatory and protective factor against the negative impact of victimization on adjustment in adolescents. The main objective of this work was to analyze the mediating effect of self-concept on life satisfaction and the moderated mediation effect of EI on self-concept and life satisfaction in the context of peer victimization. The participants in the study were 1,318 Spanish students of both sexes and aged between 11 and 18 (",

    "abstract": "The current study mainly explored the influence of fluid intelligence (IQ) and emotional intelligence (EI) on affective decision-making from a developmental perspective, specifically, during the transition from childhood into early adolescence. Meanwhile, their age-related differences in affective decision-making were explored. A total of 198 participants aged 8-12 completed the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), the Cattell's Culture Fair Intelligence Test and the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Child Form. Based on the net scores of IGT, the development of affective decision-making ability did not increase monotonically with age, and there was a developmental trend of an impaired IGT performance in early adolescence (aged 11-12), especially in the early learning phase (first 40 trials) of the IGT. More importantly, IQ and EI played different roles for children and early adolescents: IQ and EI jointly predicted the IGT performance for 8-10 years old children, whereas only EI contributed to the IGT performance of 11-12 years old early adolescents. The present study extends the evidence how cognitive processing and emotional processing interact in affective decision-making from the developmental perspective. Furthermore, it provides insights of future research and intervention with early adolescents' poor affective decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), in general, refers to the machines (or computers) that mimic \"cognitive\" functions that we associate with our mind, such as \"learning\" and \"solving problem\". New biomarkers derived from medical imaging are being discovered and are then fused with non-imaging biomarkers (such as office, laboratory, physiological, genetic, epidemiological, and clinical-based biomarkers) in a big data framework, to develop AI systems. These systems can support risk prediction and monitoring. This perspective narrative shows the powerful methods of AI for tracking cardiovascular risks. We conclude that AI could potentially become an integral part of the COVID-19 disease management system. Countries, large and small, should join hands with the WHO in building biobanks for scientists around the world to build AI-based platforms for tracking the cardiovascular risk assessment during COVID-19 times and long-term follow-up of the survivors.",

    "abstract": "In addition to being pivotal for the host health, the skin microbiome possesses a large reservoir of metabolic enzymes, which can metabolize molecules (cosmetics, medicines, pollutants, etc.) that form a major part of the skin exposome. Therefore, to predict the complete metabolism of any molecule by skin microbiome, a curated database of metabolic enzymes (1,094,153), reactions, and substrates from \u223c900 bacterial species from 19 different skin sites were used to develop \"SkinBug.\" It integrates machine learning, neural networks, and chemoinformatics methods, and displays a multiclass multilabel accuracy of up to 82.4% and binary accuracy of up to 90.0%. SkinBug predicts all possible metabolic reactions and associated enzymes, reaction centers, skin microbiome species harboring the enzyme, and the respective skin sites. Thus, SkinBug will be an indispensable tool to predict xenobiotic/biotic metabolism by skin microbiome and will find applications in exposome and microbiome studies, dermatology, and skin cancer research.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has made deep inroads into dentistry in the last few years. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the development of AI applications that are widely employed in dentistry and evaluate their performance in terms of diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and predicting the prognosis of the treatment.\nThe literature for this paper was identified and selected by performing a thorough search in the electronic data bases like PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Google scholar, Scopus, Web of science, and Saudi digital library published over the past two decades (January 2000-March 15, 2020).After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 43 articles were read in full and critically analyzed. Quality analysis was performed using QUADAS-2.\nAI technologies are widely implemented in a wide range of dentistry specialties. Most of the documented work is focused on AI models that rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). These AI models have been used in detection and diagnosis of dental caries, vertical root fractures, apical lesions, salivary gland diseases, maxillary sinusitis, maxillofacial cysts, cervical lymph nodes metastasis, osteoporosis, cancerous lesions, alveolar bone loss, predicting orthodontic extractions, need for orthodontic treatments, cephalometric analysis, age and gender determination.\nThese studies indicate that the performance of an AI based automated system is excellent. They mimic the precision and accuracy of trained specialists, in some studies it was found that these systems were even able to outmatch dental specialists in terms of performance and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In the recent years artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized in the field of dentistry. The aim of this systematic review was to document the scope and performance of the artificial intelligence based models that have been widely used in orthodontic diagnosis, treatment planning, and predicting the prognosis.\nThe literature for this paper was identified and selected by performing a thorough search for articles in the electronic data bases like Pubmed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Google scholar, Scopus and Web of science, Saudi digital library published over the past two decades (January 2000-February 2020). After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 articles were read in full and critically analyzed. QUADAS-2 were adapted for quality analysis of the studies included.\nAI technology has been widely applied for identifying cephalometric landmarks, determining need for orthodontic extractions, determining the degree of maturation of the cervical vertebra, predicting the facial attractiveness after orthognathic surgery, predicting the need for orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment planning. Most of these artificial intelligence models are based on either artificial neural networks (ANNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nThe results from these reported studies are suggesting that these automated systems have performed exceptionally well, with an accuracy and precision similar to the trained examiners. These systems can simplify the tasks and provide results in quick time which can save the dentist time and help the dentist to perform his duties more efficiently. These systems can be of great value in orthodontics.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a chronic disease that causes the most deaths in the world, being a public health problem nowadays. Even though breast cancer affects the daily lives of patients, many women become resilient after the disease, decreasing the impact of the diagnosis. Based on a positive psychology approach, the concept of co-vitality arises understood as a set of socio-emotional competencies that enhance psychological adaptation. In this sense, emotional intelligence is one of the main protective factors associated with resilience. However, it is not always as beneficial as it seems, and can lead to collateral effects on psychological adjustment. Given this controversy, this study aims to find the specific processes through which the dimensions of Perceived Emotional Intelligence (PEI) (Emotional Attention, Emotional Clarity, and Mood Repair) can act as a risk or protective factor in the development of resilience. The total sample was 167 women (Age: ",

Gastrointestinal Endoscopy has shown to be a fertile terrain for the development of AI systems aiming to aid endoscopists in various aspects of their daily activity. Lesion detection can be one of the two main aspects in which AI can increase diagnostic yield and abilities of endoscopists. In colonoscopy, it is well known that a substantial rate of missed neoplasia is still present, representing the major cause of interval cancer. In addition, an extremely high variability in adenoma detection rate, the main key quality indicator in colonoscopy, has been extensively reported.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence algorithms have the potential to become an important diagnostic tool to optimize stroke workflow. Viz LVO is a medical product leveraging a convolutional neural network designed to detect large-vessel occlusions on CTA scans and notify the treatment team within minutes via a dedicated mobile application. We aimed to evaluate the detection accuracy of the Viz LVO in real clinical practice at a comprehensive stroke center.\nViz LVO was installed for this study in a comprehensive stroke center. All consecutive head and neck CTAs performed from January 2018 to March 2019 were scanned by the algorithm for detection of large-vessel occlusions. The system results were compared with the formal reports of senior neuroradiologists used as ground truth for the presence of a large-vessel occlusion.\nA total of 1167 CTAs were included in the study. Of these, 404 were stroke protocols. Seventy-five (6.4%) patients had a large-vessel occlusion as ground truth; 61 were detected by the system. Sensitivity was 0.81, negative predictive value was 0.99, and accuracy was 0.94. In the stroke protocol subgroup, 72 (17.8%) of 404 patients had a large-vessel occlusion, with 59 identified by the system, showing a sensitivity of 0.82, negative predictive value of 0.96, and accuracy of 0.89.\nOur experience evaluating Viz LVO shows that the system has the potential for early identification of patients with stroke with large-vessel occlusions, hopefully improving future management and stroke care.",

    "abstract": "Digital technologies are transforming human relations, interactions and experiences in the business landscape. Whilst a great potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in the service industries is predicted, the concrete influence of AI on customer experiences remains little understood. Drawing upon the service-dominant (SD) logic as a theoretical lens and a scenario technique approach, this study explores the impact of artificial intelligence as an operant resource on event experiences. The findings offer a conceptualisation of three distinct future scenarios for the year 2026 that map out a spectrum of experiences from value co-creation to value co-destruction of events. The paper makes a theoretical contribution in that it bridges marketing, technology and experience literature, and zooms in on AI as a non-human actor of future experience life ecosystems. A practical guideline for event planners is offered on how to implement AI across each touch point of the events ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "The linings of the oral cavity are excellent needle-free vaccination sites, able to induce immune responses at distal sites and confer systemic protection. However, owing to the mucosal tissues' intrinsic characteristics, the design of effective antigen-delivery systems is not an easy task. In the present work, we propose to develop and characterize thermosensitive and mucoadhesive hydrogels for orotransmucosal vaccination taking advantage of artificial intelligence tools (AIT). Hydrogels of variable composition were obtained combining Pluronic\u00ae F127 (PF127), Hybrane\u00ae S1200 (HS1200) and Gantrez\u00ae AN119 (AN119) or S97 (S97). Systems were characterized in terms of physicochemical properties, adhesion capacity to mucosal tissues and antigen-like microspheres release. Additionally, polymers biocompatibility and their immune-stimulation capacity was assessed in human macrophages. Interestingly, cells treated with HS1200 exhibited a significant proliferation enhancement compared to control. The use of AIT allowed to determine the effect of each polymer on formulations properties. The proportions of PF127 and Gantrez\u00ae are mainly the factors controlling gelation temperature, mucoadhesion, adhesion work and gel strength. Meanwhile, cohesion and short-term microsphere release are dependent on the PF127 concentration. However, long-term microsphere release varies depending on the Gantrez\u00ae variety and the PF127 concentration used. Hydrogels prepared with S97 showed slower microsphere release. The use of AIT allowed to establish the conditions able to produce ternary hydrogels with immune-stimulatory properties together with adequate mucoadhesion capacity and antigen-like microspheres release.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is widely used as a diagnostic tool for evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). Despite the excellent capability to rule-out CAD, CCTA may overestimate the degree of stenosis; furthermore, CCTA analysis can be time consuming, often requiring advanced postprocessing techniques. In consideration of the most recent ESC guidelines on CAD management, which will likely increase CCTA volume over the next years, new tools are necessary to shorten reporting time and improve the accuracy for the detection of ischemia-inducing coronary lesions. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) may provide a helpful tool in CCTA, improving the evaluation and quantification of coronary stenosis, plaque characterization, and assessment of myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, in comparison with existing risk scores, machine-learning algorithms can better predict the outcome utilizing both imaging findings and clinical parameters. Medical AI is moving from the research field to daily clinical practice, and with the increasing number of CCTA examinations, AI will be extensively utilized in cardiac imaging. This review is aimed at illustrating the state of the art in AI-based CCTA applications and future clinical scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic computer forensics is a popular area in computer forensics that combines network intrusion technology with computer forensics technology. A novel dynamic computer forensics model is proposed based on an artificial immune system. Simulating the artificial immune mechanism, the definitions of self, non-self, and immunocyte in the network transactions are given. Then, detailed evolution processes for immature detectors, mature detectors, and memory detectors are given. Real-time network risk evaluation equations are constructed, which can compute the risk of each type of network attack. Finally, computer forensics is accomplished according to the real-time network risk. The immune cells dynamically capture the real-time computer system status of the invading antigen, including CPU utilization, memory utilization, network bandwidth utilization status, etc. Theoretical analysis and comparative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model improves the real-time efficiency and performance with low technical requirements for technicians compared with existing models.",

    "abstract": "Drug discovery and the development of safe and effective therapeutics is an intricate procedure, further complicated in the context of cancer research by the inherent heterogeneity and complexity of the disease. To address the difficulties of identifying, validating, and pursuing a promising drug target, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies including machine learning (ML) have been adopted at all stages throughout the drug development pipeline. Various methods are widely employed to efficiently process and learn from experimental data sets, with agent-based models garnering thorough interest due to their ability to model individual cell populations with aberrant phenotypes. The predictive power of artificial intelligence modelling techniques founded in comprehensive datasets and automated decision-making generates an obvious avenue of interest for application in the drug discovery pipeline.",

    "abstract": "The death of a patient is one of the most stressful situations a healthcare professional can face for the first time at work or during training. Palliative and end of life care education aims to impart appropriate awareness and understanding of key issues arising at the end of life, but also to develop learners' interpersonal skills in leadership, communication and management of their own emotional load. There is a pressing need to be explicit around death, dying and care at the end of life and to equip clinical staff with the ability to manage the emotions that are experienced by their patients, their teams and themselves. Emotional intelligence is considered as a framework for medical educators to use in this setting with presentation of a simulated patient vignette to contextualise this.",

    "abstract": "To explore the value of artificial intelligence combined with multi-parametric MRI (AI-mpMRI) in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.\nThis retrospective study included 64 cases of prostate cancer confirmed by biopsy and treated by radical prostatectomy from May 2017 to February 2018. The mpMRI images of T2 weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic-contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI and the pathological sections corresponding to the three sequential MRI images were collected. The benign and malignant regions were labeled on the pathological slice level, the three sequential MRI axial images at the same level were virtually covered with the pathological slice using computer-aided transparent mapping technology, and selected the fixed-sized benign and malignant regions of interest (ROI). The MATLAB software was used to display the features of the images and screen out the characteristic parameters with P < 0.05, so as to derive high-accuracy analytical methods for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.\nA total of 31 image characteristics were extracted with the MATLAB software, and 3 high-accuracy analytical methods screened out for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, including the linear discrimination, logistic regression analysis, and support vector machine classification, with the accuracy rates of 75.9%, 75.4% and 74.9% and the areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.83, 0.82 and 0.82, respectively.\nAI-mpMRI can achieve a high detection rate in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer and therefore has a high clinical application value.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of targeted drugs heavily relies on three-dimensional (3D) structures of target proteins. When the 3D structure of a protein target is unknown, it is very difficult to design its corresponding targeted drugs. Although the 3D structures of some proteins (the so-called undruggable targets) are known, their targeted drugs are still absent. As increasing crystal/cryogenic electron microscopy structures are deposited in Protein Data Bank, it is much more possible to discover the targeted drugs. Moreover, it is also highly probable to turn previous undruggable targets into druggable ones when we identify their hidden allosteric sites. In this review, we focus on the currently available advanced methods for the discovery of novel compounds targeting proteins without 3D structure and how to turn undruggable targets into druggable ones.",

    "abstract": "Indirect measurement can be used as an alternative to obtain a desired quantity, whose physical positioning or use of a direct sensor in the plant is expensive or not possible. This procedure can been improved by means of feedback control strategies of a secondary variable, which can be measured and controlled. Its main advantage is a new form of dynamic response, with improvements in the response time of the measurement of the quantity of interest. In water pumping networks, this methodology can be employed for measuring the flow indirectly, which can be advantageous due to the high price of flow sensors and the operational complexity to install them in pipelines. In this work, we present the use of artificial intelligence techniques in the implementation of the feedback system for indirect flow measurement. Among the contributions of this new technique is the design of the pressure controller using the Fuzzy logic theory, which rules out the need for knowing the plant model, as well as the use of an artificial neural network for the construction of nonlinear models with the purpose of indirectly estimating the flow. The validation of the proposed approach was carried out through experimental tests in a water pumping system, fully automated and installed at the Laboratory of Hydraulic and Energy Efficiency in Sanitation at the Federal University of Paraiba (LENHS/UFPB). The results were compared with an electromagnetic flow sensor present in the system, obtaining a maximum relative error of 10%.",

    "abstract": "According to the statistics, 40% of unplanned disruptions in electricity distribution grids are caused by failure of equipment in high voltage (HV) transformer substations. These damages in most cases are caused by partial discharge (PD) phenomenon which progressively leads to false operation of equipment. The detection and localization of PD at early stage can significantly reduce repair and maintenance expenses of HV assets. In this paper, a non-invasive PD detection and localization solution has been proposed, which uses three ultrasonic sensors arranged in an L shape to detect, identify and localize PD source. The solution uses a fusion of ultrasonic signal processing, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods to classify and process PD signals. The research revealed that the support vector machines classifier performed best among two other classifiers in terms of sensitivity and specificity while classifying discharge and surrounding noise signals. The proposed ultrasonic signal processing methods based on binaural principles allowed us to achieve an experimental lateral source positioning error of 0.1 m by using 0.2 m spacing between L shaped sensors. Finally, an approach based on DL was suggested, which allowed us to detect a single PD source in optical images and, in such a way, to provide visual representation of PD location.",

    "abstract": "Real-time reverse transcription (RT) PCR is the gold standard for detecting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), owing to its sensitivity and specificity, thereby meeting the demand for the rising number of cases. The scarcity of trained molecular biologists for analyzing PCR results makes data verification a challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI) was designed to ease verification, by detecting atypical profiles in PCR curves caused by contamination or artifacts. Four classes of simulated real-time RT-PCR curves were generated, namely, positive, early, no, and abnormal amplifications. Machine learning (ML) models were generated and tested using small amounts of data from each class. The best model was used for classifying the big data obtained by the Virology Laboratory of Simon Bolivar University from real-time RT-PCR curves for SARS-CoV-2, and the model was retrained and implemented in a software that correlated patient data with test and AI diagnoses. The best strategy for AI included a binary classification model, which was generated from simulated data, where data analyzed by the first model were classified as either positive or negative and abnormal. To differentiate between negative and abnormal, the data were reevaluated using the second model. In the first model, the data required preanalysis through a combination of prepossessing. The early amplification class was eliminated from the models because the numbers of cases in big data was negligible. ML models can be created from simulated data using minimum available information. During analysis, changes or variations can be incorporated by generating simulated data, avoiding the incorporation of large amounts of experimental data encompassing all possible changes. For diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, this type of AI is critical for optimizing PCR tests because it enables rapid diagnosis and reduces false positives. Our method can also be used for other types of molecular analyses.",

    "abstract": "(1) Background: Family is considered as one of the most important elements for the transmission of healthy habits that improve the lives of students. For this reason, the present study aims to describe the degree of family functionality, emotional intelligence, Mediterranean diet adherence, and extra-curricular physical activity engagement. A further aim is to perform a correlational analysis between these variables. (2) Methods: To this end, an ad hoc questionnaire was used, alongside the APGAR, KIDMED, and Trait Meta Mood Scale (TMMS-24). (3) Results: Finally, the data suggest that a high percentage of students need to improve their diet. Further, students reporting severe family dysfunction showed worse outcomes. Thus, levels of emotional clarity were lower when family functionality was poor. Poor diet quality was also associated with lower emotional attention, with Mediterranean diet adherence being positively related to emotional clarity and repair, as well as normal family functionality. (4) Conclusions: Boys showed higher levels of adherence to the Mediterranean diet adherence, while girls reported higher family functionality. Thus, compliance with the minimum recommendations for physical activity engagement was associated with adequate adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The importance of diet for obtaining an optimal physical condition, adequate emotional state, and family functionality is highlighted.",

    "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in various medical imaging applications has expanded remarkably, and several reports have focused on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) images of the pancreas. This review briefly summarizes each report in order to help endoscopists better understand and utilize the potential of this rapidly developing AI, after a description of the fundamentals of the AI involved, as is necessary for understanding each study. At first, conventional computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) was used, which extracts and selects features from imaging data using various methods and introduces them into machine learning algorithms as inputs. Deep learning-based CAD utilizing convolutional neural networks has been used; in these approaches, the images themselves are used as inputs, and more information can be analyzed in less time and with higher accuracy. In the field of EUS imaging, although AI is still in its infancy, further research and development of AI applications is expected to contribute to the role of optical biopsy as an alternative to EUS-guided tissue sampling while also improving diagnostic accuracy through double reading with humans and contributing to EUS education.",

    "abstract": "Increasing the students' academic achievement in the international evaluation arena is a challenge for our country, and cooperative learning and emotional intelligence may be a solution for this problem. The link between cooperative learning, emotional intelligence, and academic achievement has been poorly studied so far. The objective of the present investigation was to examine the influence of cooperative learning on trait emotional intelligence and academic achievement. The methodology used was a quasi-experimental design with pre/post-measurements and experimental/control groups. The participants were primary education students (n\u00a0=\u00a0692) and teachers (n\u00a0=\u00a024) from eight public schools in Madrid, Spain. The instruments used were the Emotional Quotient-Youth Version questionnaire and internal and external assessment tests. Our\u00a0results\u00a0indicated\u00a0that cooperative learning improved scores of one dimension of trait emotional intelligence, change adaptability, and students' academic achievement (Mathematics and Spanish Language). We discussed the possible implications of these outcomes for educational practice.",

    "abstract": "With the recent development of artificial intelligence along with information and communications infrastructure, a new paradigm of online services is being developed. Whereas in the past a service system could only exchange information of the service provider at the request of the user, information can now be provided by automatically analyzing a particular need, even without a direct user request. This also holds for online platforms of used-vehicle sales. In the past, consumers needed to inconveniently determine and classify the quality of information through static data provided by service and information providers. As a result, this service field has been harmful to consumers owing to such problems as false sales, fraud, and exaggerated advertising. Despite significant efforts of platform providers, there are limited human resources for censoring the vast amounts of data uploaded by sellers. Therefore, in this study, an algorithm called YOLOv3+MSSIM Type 2 for automatically censoring the data of used-vehicle sales on an online platform was developed. To this end, an artificial intelligence system that can automatically analyze an object in a vehicle video uploaded by a seller, and an artificial intelligence system that can filter the vehicle-specific terms and profanity from the seller's video presentation, were also developed. As a result of evaluating the developed system, the average execution speed of the proposed YOLOv3+MSSIM Type 2 algorithm was 78.6 ms faster than that of the pure YOLOv3 algorithm, and the average frame rate per second was improved by 40.22 fps. In addition, the average GPU utilization rate was improved by 23.05%, proving the efficiency.",

    "abstract": "AI (Artificial intelligence) is an interdisciplinary field aimed at the development of algorithms to endow machines with the capability of executing cognitive tasks. The number of publications regarding AI and surgery has increased dramatically over the last two decades. This phenomenon can partly be explained by the exponential growth in computing power available to the largest AI training runs. AI can be classified into different sub-domains with extensive potential clinical applications in the surgical setting. AI will increasingly become a major component of clinical practice in surgery. The aim of the present Narrative Review is to give a general introduction and summarized overview of AI, as well as to present additional remarks on potential surgical applications and future perspectives in surgery.",

    "abstract": "Depression is more common among older adults, but there is a paucity of information about its association with spiritual intelligence. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and association of depressive symptoms with spiritual intelligence among older adults.\nThis community-based cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 292 older adults in a rural area of Puducherry, India. A structured questionnaire was used to collect each participant's socio-demographic and behavioral factors; the presence of depressive symptoms was assessed by using Geriatric Depression Scale (short form), spiritual intelligence by the Spiritual Intelligence Self-Report Inventory-24 questionnaire and activities of daily living by Katz Index of Independence scale. Proportion for prevalence estimate, bivariate and multivariable log binomial regression analysis were done.\nThe prevalence of depressive symptoms was 64.1 % (187/292; 95 % CI 58.3-69.3). Of total, 103 (35.3 %) had low, 92 (31.55 %) had moderate and 97 (33.2 %) had high spiritual intelligence. About 11 % (32/292) were partially or fully dependent. Depressive symptoms showed a significant association with marital status, education, sleep pattern, relationship with family members and spiritual intelligence in bivariate analysis. Depressive symptoms were high among those with low spiritual intelligence and disturbed sleep pattern with Adjusted Prevalence Ratio of 1.33 (95 %CI 1.26-1.4) and 1.06 (95 %CI 1.0-1.14) respectively.\nMajority of the older adults had depressive symptoms and significantly more among those with low spiritual intelligence and disturbed sleep. This study gives new evidence on spiritual intelligence among older adults in a community setting and the magnitude of association of depressive symptoms with spiritual intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Personal activity intelligence (PAI) is a metric developed to simplify a physically active lifestyle for the participants. Regardless of following today's advice for physical activity, a PAI score \u2265100 per week at baseline, an increase in PAI score, and a sustained high PAI score over time were found to delay premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in a large population of Norwegians. However, the association between long-term temporal change in PAI and mortality in other populations have not been investigated.\nTo test whether temporal change in PAI is associated with CVD and all-cause mortality in a large population from the United States.\nWe studied 17,613 relatively healthy participants who received at least two medical examinations in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study between 1974 and 2002. The participant's weekly PAI scores were estimated twice, and adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CVD and all-cause mortality related to changes in PAI between baseline and last examination were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression analyses.\nDuring a median follow-up time of 9.3\u00a0years [interquartile range, 2.6-16.6; 181,765 person-years], there were 1144 deaths, including 400 CVD deaths. We observed an inverse linear association between change in PAI and risk of CVD mortality (P=0.007 for linear trend, and P=0.35 for quadratic trend). Compared to participants with zero PAI at both examinations, multivariable-adjusted analyses demonstrated that participants who maintained high PAI scores (\u2265100 PAI at both examinations) had a 51% reduced risk of CVD mortality [AHR, 0.49: 95% CI, 0.26-0.95)], and 42% reduced risk of all-cause mortality [AHR, 0.58: 95% CI, 0.41-0.83)]. For participants who increased their PAI scores over time (PAI score of zero at first examination and \u2265100 at last examination), the AHRs were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.55-1.02) for CVD mortality, and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69-0.99) for all-cause mortality. Participants who maintained high PAI score had 4.8 (95% CI, 3.3-6.4) years of life gained. For those who increased their PAI score over time, the corresponding years gained were 1.8\u00a0years (95% CI, 0.1-3.5).\nAmong relatively healthy participants, an increase in PAI and maintaining a high PAI score over time was associated with reduced risk of CVD and all-cause mortality.\nOur objective was to investigate the association between temporal changes in PAI and mortality in a large population from the United States. In this prospective cohort study of 17,613 relatively healthy participants at baseline, maintaining a high PAI score and an increase in PAI score over an average period of 6.3\u00a0years was associated with a significant reduction in CVD and all-cause mortality. Based on our results, clinicians can easily recommend that patients obtain at least 100 PAI for most favourable protection against CVD- and all-cause mortality, but can also mention that significant benefits also occur at maintaining low-to-moderate PAI levels.",

For participants who increased their PAI scores over time (PAI score of zero at first examination and \u2265100 at last examination), the AHRs were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.55-1.02) for CVD mortality, and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69-0.99) for all-cause mortality. Participants who maintained high PAI score had 4.8 (95% CI, 3.3-6.4) years of life gained. For those who increased their PAI score over time, the corresponding years gained were 1.8\u00a0years (95% CI, 0.1-3.5).",

    "abstract": "Pathological low-energy (LE) vertebral compression fractures (VFs) are common complications of osteoporosis and predictors of subsequent LE fractures. In 84% of cases, VFs are not reported on chest CT (CCT), which calls for the development of an artificial intelligence-based (AI) assistant that would help radiology specialists to improve the diagnosis of osteoporosis complications and prevent new LE fractures.\nTo develop an AI model for automated diagnosis of compression fractures of the thoracic spine based on chest CT images.\nBetween September 2019 and May 2020 the authors performed a retrospective sampling study of \u0421\u0421\u0422 images. The 160 of results were selected and anonymized. The data was labeled by seven readers. Using the morphometric analysis, the investigators received the following metric data: ventral, medial and dorsal dimensions. This was followed by a semiquantitative assessment of VFs degree. The data was used to develop the Comprise-G AI mode based on CNN, which subsequently measured the size of the vertebral bodies and then calculates the compression degree. The model was evaluated with the ROC curve analysis and by calculating sensitivity and specificity values.\nFormed data consist of 160 patients (a training group - 100 patients; a test group - 60 patients). The total of 2,066 vertebrae was annotated. When detecting Grade 2 and 3 maximum VFs in patients the Comprise-G model demonstrated sensitivity - 90,7%, specificity - 90,7%, AUC ROC - 0.974 on the 5-FOLD cross-validation data of the training dataset; on the test data - sensitivity - 83,2%, specificity - 90,0%, AUC ROC - 0.956; in vertebrae demonstrated sensitivity - 91,5%, specificity - 95,2%, AUC ROC - 0.981 on the cross-validation data; for the test data sensitivity - 79,3%, specificity - 98,7%, AUC ROC - 0.978.\nThe Comprise-G model demonstrated high diagnostic capabilities in detecting the VFs on CCT images and can be recommended for further validation.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence and big data are more and more used in medicine, either in prevention, diagnosis or treatment, and are clearly modifying the way medicine is thought and practiced. Some authors argue that the use of artificial intelligence techniques to analyze big data would even constitute a scientific revolution, in medicine as much as in other scientific disciplines. Moreover, artificial intelligence techniques, coupled with mobile health technologies, could furnish a personalized medicine, adapted to the individuality of each patient. In this paper we argue that this conception is largely a myth: what health professionals and patients need is not more data, but data that are critically appraised, especially to avoid bias.\nIn this historical and conceptual article, we focus on two main problems: first, the data and the problem of its validity; second, the inference drawn from the data by AI, and the establishment of correlations through the use of algorithms. We use examples from the contemporary use of mobile health (mHealth), i.e. the practice of medicine and public health supported by mobile or wearable devices such as mobile phones or smart watches.\nWe show that the validity of the data and of the inferences drawn from these mHealth data are likely to be biased. As biases are insensitive to the size of the sample, even if the sample is the whole population, artificial intelligence and big data cannot avoid biases and even tend to increase them.\nThe large amount of data thus appears rather as a problem than a solution. What contemporary medicine needs is not more data or more algorithms, but a critical appraisal of the data and of the analysis of the data. Considering the history of epidemiology, we propose three research priorities concerning the use of artificial intelligence and big data in medicine.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the performance of four artificial intelligence-aided diagnostic systems in identifying and measuring four types of pulmonary nodules.\nFour types of nodules were implanted in a commercial lung phantom. The phantom was scanned with multislice spiral computed tomography, after which four systems (A, B, C, D) were used to identify the nodules and measure their volumes.\nThe relative volume error (RVE) of system A was the lowest for all nodules, except for small ground glass nodules (SGGNs). System C had the smallest RVE for SGGNs, -0.13 (-0.56, 0.00). In the Bland-Altman test, only systems A and C passed the consistency test, P\u00a0=\u00a00.40. In terms of precision, the miss rate (MR) of system C was 0.00% for small solid nodules (SSNs), ground glass nodules (GGNs), and solid nodules (SNs) but 4.17% for SGGNs. The comparable system D MRs for SGGNs, SSNs, and GGNs were 71.30%, 25.93%, and 47.22%, respectively, the highest among all the systems. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that system A had the best performance in recognizing SSNs and GGNs, with areas under the curve of 0.91 and 0.68.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the possibility of AI-based addendum therapy for borderline personality disorder, its potential advantages and limitations. Identity disturbance in this condition is strongly connected to self-narratives, which manifest excessive incoherence, causal gaps, dysfunctional beliefs, and diminished self-attributions of agency. Different types of therapy aim at boosting self-knowledge through self-narratives in BPD. The suggestion of this paper is that human-to-human therapy could be complemented by AI assistance holding out the promise of making patients' self-narratives more coherent through improving the accuracy of their self-assessments, reflection on their emotions, and understanding their relationships with others. Theoretical and pragmatic arguments are presented in favour of this idea, and certain technical solutions are suggested to implement it.",

    "abstract": "To test medical students' perceptions of the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on radiology and the influence of these perceptions on their choice of radiology as a lifetime career.\nA cross-sectional multicenter survey of medical students in Saudi Arabia was conducted in April 2019.\nOf the 476 respondents, 34 considered radiology their first specialty choice, 26 considered it their second choice, and 65 considered it their third choice. Only 31% believed that AI would replace radiologists in their lifetime, while 44.8% believed that AI would minimize the number of radiologists needed in the future. Approximately 50% believed they had a good understanding of AI; however, when knowledge of AI was tested using five questions, on average, only 22% of the questions were answered correctly. Among the respondents who ranked radiology as their first choice, 58.8% were anxious about the uncertain impact of AI on radiology. The number of respondents who ranked radiology as one of their top three choices increased by 14 when AI was not a consideration. Radiology conferences and the opinions of radiologists had the most influence on the respondents' preferences for radiology.\nThe worry that AI might displace radiologists in the future had a negative influence on medical students' consideration of radiology as a career. Academic radiologists are encouraged to educate their students about AI and its potential impact when students are considering radiology as a lifetime career choice.\nRapid advances of AI in radiology will certainly impact the specialty, the concern of AI impact on radiology had negative influence in our participants and investing in AI education and is highly recommended.",

    "results": "Of the 476 respondents, 34 considered radiology their first specialty choice, 26 considered it their second choice, and 65 considered it their third choice. Only 31% believed that AI would replace radiologists in their lifetime, while 44.8% believed that AI would minimize the number of radiologists needed in the future. Approximately 50% believed they had a good understanding of AI; however, when knowledge of AI was tested using five questions, on average, only 22% of the questions were answered correctly. Among the respondents who ranked radiology as their first choice, 58.8% were anxious about the uncertain impact of AI on radiology. The number of respondents who ranked radiology as one of their top three choices increased by 14 when AI was not a consideration. Radiology conferences and the opinions of radiologists had the most influence on the respondents' preferences for radiology.",

    "abstract": "A number of tasks have been developed to measure the affective theory of mind (ToM), nevertheless, recent studies found that different affective ToM tasks do not correlate with each other, suggesting that further studies on affective ToM and its measurement are needed. More in-depth knowledge of the tools that are available to assess affective ToM is needed to decide which should be used in research and in clinical practice, and how to interpret results. The current study focuses on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) primarily to investigate in a sample of 112 children the currently unexplored relationships in middle childhood between performance on the RMET and fluid intelligence. Relationships with receptive vocabulary, age, and sex were also investigated. Moreover, because studying the family's influence on children mentalization could have important implications in developing prevention and treatment interventions, this study offers a novel contribution to the field by exploring the family's influence on children's RMET performance. Although significant positive correlations were found among RMET-C performance, fluid intelligence, and receptive language, regression analysis revealed that fluid intelligence was the only predictor. No family influence was found on children's RMET performance. On the whole, results from the current study offer some support to the hypothesis that RMET-C is not a \"pure\" ToM task, specifically the effect of fluid intelligence on RMET performance should be taken into account when RMET is used both in research and in the clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a sort of new technical science which can simulate, extend and expand human intelligence by developing theories, methods and application systems. In the last five years, the application of AI in medical research has become a hot topic in modern science and technology. Gynecological malignant tumors involves a wide range of knowledge, and AI can play an important part in these aspects, such as medical image recognition, auxiliary diagnosis, drug research and development, treatment scheme formulation and other fields. The purpose of this paper is to describe the progress of AI in gynecological malignant tumors and discuss some problems in its application. It is believed that AI improves the efficiency of diagnosis, reduces the burden of clinicians, and improves the effect of treatment and prognosis. AI will play an irreplaceable role in the field of gynecological malignant oncology and will promote the development of medicine and further promote the transformation from traditional medicine to precision medicine and preventive medicine. However, there are also some problems in the application of AI in gynecologic malignant tumors. For example, AI, inseparable from human participation, still needs to be more \"humanized\", and needs to further protect patients' privacy and health, improve legal and insurance protection, and further improve according to local ethnic conditions and national conditions. However, it is believed that with the continuous development of AI, especially ensemble classifier, and deep learning will have a profound influence on the future of medical technology, which is a powerful driving force for future medical innovation and reform.",

    "abstract": "Past research regarding the emotional characteristics of kibbutz children raised with communal sleeping arrangements (CSA) showed inconsistent findings for emotional difficulties, such as insecure attachment and lowered ability for intimacy. Only little research has examined these children's emotional characteristics in their adulthood. Trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) is a new concept measuring a constellation of correlated emotional traits that capture a person's typical way of processing emotional information and reacting to it. The present study examined if difficulties in intimacy and trait EI characterize adults who had been raised in CSA kibbutzim (Hebrew plural of kibbutz). Participants comprised 1185 adults, aged 30-79, of whom 735 were raised in CSA kibbutzim, and the rest did not grow up in a Kibbutz at all. The participants completed three self-report questionnaires: Schutte's Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSEIT) to measure trait EI; the Revised Adult Attachment Scale to measure adult attachment; and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Questionnaire to measure self-esteem. Results showed that most of the kibbutz CSA participants revealed levels of intimacy and trait EI comparable to the non-kibbutz group. However, a significant difference was found among adults with low self-esteem and poor attachment quality: For these participants, trait EI and intimacy were significantly lower for the CSA kibbutz group than for the non-kibbutz group. Furthermore, the CSA kibbutz group reported poorer non-verbal communication skills than the non-kibbutz group. We suggest that a minority of the CSA kibbutz children were less resilient to the kibbutz ecology. These children might have been more vulnerable to the effects of limited social options, decreased parental support, and the kibbutz education's ideological demands. For these children, the effects of communal upbringing on intimacy and attachment appear to be long-lasting, extending throughout their adulthood.",

First, we explored whether different belief profiles exist. Second, we examined if the emergent belief profiles (1) differ by demographic variables (e.g., age, education, child's self-regulation) and (2) are related to parents' failure beliefs, goal orientation (i.e., learning goals, performance-approach goals, performance-avoidance goals), and co-regulatory strategies (i.e., mastery-oriented and helpless-oriented strategies).

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a combination of different technologies that enable machines to sense, comprehend, and learn with human-like levels of intelligence. AI technology will eventually enhance human capability, provide machines genuine autonomy, and reduce errors, and increase productivity and efficiency. AI seems promising, and the field is full of invention, novel applications; however, the limitation of machine learning suggests a cautious optimism as the right strategy. AI is also becoming incorporated into medicine to improve patient care by speeding up processes and achieving greater accuracy for optimal patient care. AI using deep learning technology has been used to identify, differentiate catalog images in several medical fields including gastrointestinal endoscopy. The gastrointestinal endoscopy field involves endoscopic diagnoses and prognostication of various digestive diseases using image analysis with the help of various gastrointestinal endoscopic device systems. AI-based endoscopic systems can reliably detect and provide crucial information on gastrointestinal pathology based on their training and validation. These systems can make gastroenterology practice easier, faster, more reliable, and reduce inter-observer variability in the coming years. However, the thought that these systems will replace human decision making replace gastrointestinal endoscopists does not seem plausible in the near future. In this review, we discuss AI and associated various technological terminologies, evolving role in gastrointestinal endoscopy, and future possibilities.",

    "abstract": "Precision medicine (MP), using machine learning (ML) techniques of artificial intelligence (AI), analyzes the so-called \"big data\" to improve diagnostic skills and predictive response to therapy, in order to tailor the treatment on individual characteristics. Furthermore, the use of large databases is limited by their very nature, as data and not values, capable of threatening the validity and generalizability of the conclusions. Currently, for this reason, interventions on populations, subpopulations or groups are still fundamental, favoring, especially in the pharmacological field, the response of the \"average patient\", over the particular case. Therefore, it is essential to carry out methodologically robust, prospective studies of comparison between teams of doctors who use systems based on algorithms and teams that do not are using them, avoiding direct comparisons, less significant, between doctors and AI. Only in this case will technologies effectively applicable in real rather than experimental clinical contexts be implemented in the near future.",

    "abstract": "We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) method for estimating fetal weights of Japanese fetuses based on the gestational weeks and the bi-parietal diameter, abdominal circumference, and femur length. The AI comprised of neural network architecture was trained by deep learning with a dataset that consists of \u00b1 2 standard devia-tion (SD), \u00b1 1.5SD, and \u00b1 0SD categories of the approved standard values of ultrasonic measurements of the fetal weights of Japanese fetuses (Japan Society of Ultrasonics in Medicine [JSUM] data). We investigated the residuals and compared 2 other regression formulae for estimating the fetal weights of Japanese fetuses by t-test and Bland-Altman analyses, respectively. The residuals of the AI for the test dataset that was 12.5% of the JSUM data were 6.4 \u00b1 2.6, -3.8 \u00b1 8.6, and -0.32 \u00b1 6.3 (g) at -2SD, +2SD, and all categories, respectively. The residu-als of another AI method created with all of the JSUM data, of which 20% were randomized validation data, were -1.5 \u00b1 9.4, -2.5 \u00b1 7.3, and -1.1 \u00b1 6.7 (g) for -2SD, +2SD, and all categories, respectively. The residuals of this AI were not different from zero, whereas those of the published formulae differed from zero. Though vali-dation is required, the AI demonstrated potential for generating fetal weights accurately, especially for extreme fetal weights.",

    "abstract": "The global population is at present suffering from a pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The goal of this study was to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict blueprints for designing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, that contain a sufficiently broad repertoire of T-cell epitopes capable of providing coverage and protection across the global population. To help achieve these aims, we profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome across the most frequent 100 HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR alleles in the human population, using host-infected cell surface antigen presentation and immunogenicity predictors from the NEC Immune Profiler suite of tools, and generated comprehensive epitope maps. We then used these epitope maps as input for a Monte Carlo simulation designed to identify statistically significant \"epitope hotspot\" regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic across a broad spectrum of HLA types. We then removed epitope hotspots that shared significant homology with proteins in the human proteome to reduce the chance of inducing off-target autoimmune responses. We also analyzed the antigen presentation and immunogenic landscape of all the nonsynonymous mutations across 3,400 different sequences of the virus, to identify a trend whereby SARS-COV-2 mutations are predicted to have reduced potential to be presented by host-infected cells, and consequently detected by the host immune system. A sequence conservation analysis then removed epitope hotspots that occurred in less-conserved regions of the viral proteome. Finally, we used a database of the HLA haplotypes of approximately 22,000 individuals to develop a \"digital twin\" type simulation to model how effective different combinations of hotspots would work in a diverse human population; the approach identified an optimal constellation of epitope hotspots that could provide maximum coverage in the global population.\u00a0By combining the antigen presentation to the infected-host cell surface and immunogenicity predictions of the NEC Immune Profiler with a robust Monte Carlo and digital twin simulation, we have profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identified a subset of epitope hotspots that could be harnessed in a vaccine formulation to provide a broad coverage across the global population.",

    "abstract": "Excessive fluoride exposure is related to adverse health outcomes, but whether dopamine (DA) relative genes are involved in the health effect of low-moderate fluoride exposure on children's intelligence remain unclear.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study to explore the role of DA relative genes in the health effect of low-moderate fluoride exposure in drinking water.\nWe recruited 567 resident children, aged 6-11 years old, randomly from endemic and non-endemic fluorosis areas in Tianjin, China. Spot urine samples were tested for urinary fluoride concentration, combined Raven`s test was used for intelligence quotient test. Fasting venous blood were collected to analyze ANKK1 Taq1A (rs1800497), COMT Val158Met (rs4680), DAT1 40\u00a0bp VNTR and MAOA uVNTR. Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess associations between fluoride exposure and IQ scores. We applied multiplicative and additive models to appraise single gene-environment interaction. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to evaluate high-dimensional interactions of gene-gene and gene-environment.\nIn adjusted model, fluoride exposure was inversely associated with IQ scores (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-5.957, 95% CI: -9.712, -2.202). The mean IQ scores of children with high-activity MAOA genotype was significantly lower than IQ scores of those with low-activity (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) or female heterozygote (P\u00a0=\u00a00.016) genotype. We detected effect modification by four DA relative genes (ANKK1, COMT, DAT1 and MAOA) on the association between UF and IQ scores. We also found a high-dimensional gene-environment interaction among UF, ANKK1, COMT and MAOA on the effect of IQ (testing balanced accuracy = 0.5302, CV consistency: 10/10, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0107).\nOur study suggests DA relative genes may modify the association between fluoride and intelligence, and a potential interaction among fluoride exposure and DA relative genes on IQ.",

    "abstract": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been actively promoting the use of real-world data (RWD) in drug development. RWD can generate important real-world evidence reflecting the real-world clinical environment where the treatments are used. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine- and deep-learning (ML/DL) methods, have been increasingly used across many stages of the drug development process. Advancements in AI have also provided new strategies to analyze large, multidimensional RWD. Thus, we conducted a rapid review of articles from the past 20 years, to provide an overview of the drug development studies that use both AI and RWD. We found that the most popular applications were adverse event detection, trial recruitment, and drug repurposing. Here, we also discuss current research gaps and future opportunities.",

    "abstract": "The triage and initial care of injured patients and a subsequent right level of care is paramount for an overall outcome after traumatic injury. Early recognition of patients is an important case of such decision-making with risk of worse prognosis. This article is to answer if clinical and paraclinical signs can predict the critical conditions of injured patients after traumatic injury resuscitation.\nThe study included 1107 trauma patients, 16 years and older. The patients were trauma victims of Levels I and II triage and admitted to the Rajaee (Emtiaz) Trauma Hospital, Shiraz, in 2014-2015. The cross-industry process for data mining methodology and modeling was used for assessing the best early clinical and paraclinical variables to predict the patients' prognosis. Five modeling methods including the support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor algorithms, Bagging and Adaboost, and the neural network were compared by some evaluation criteria.\nLearning algorithms can predict the deterioration of injured patients by monitoring the Bagging and SVM models with 99% accuracy. The most-fitted variables were Glasgow Coma Scale score, base deficit, and diastolic blood pressure especially after initial resuscitation in the algorithms for overall outcome predictions.\nData mining could help in triage, initial treatment, and further decision-making for outcome measures in trauma patients. Clinical and paraclinical variables after resuscitation could predict short-term outcomes much better than variables on arrival. With artificial intelligence modeling system, diastolic blood pressure after resuscitation has a greater association with predicting early mortality rather than systolic blood pressure after resuscitation. Artificial intelligence monitoring may have a role in trauma care and should be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in the field of radiology is becoming more common. Several studies have demonstrated the potential utility of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques as aids for radiologists to solve specific radiological challenges. The decision-making process, the establishment of specific clinical or radiological targets, the profile of the different professionals involved in the development of AI solutions, and the relation with partnerships and stakeholders are only some of the main issues that have to be faced and solved prior to starting the development of radiological AI solutions. Among all the players in this multidisciplinary team, the communication between radiologists and data scientists is essential for a successful collaborative work. There are specific skills that are inherent to radiological and medical training that are critical for identifying anatomical or clinical targets as well as for segmenting or labelling lesions. These skills would then have to be transferred, explained, and taught to the data science experts to facilitate their comprehension and integration into ML or DL algorithms. On the other hand, there is a wide range of complex software packages, deep neural-network architectures, and data transfer processes for which radiologists need the expertise of software engineers and data scientists in order to select the optimal manner to analyse and post-process this amount of data. This paper offers a summary of the top five challenges faced by radiologists and data scientists including tips and tricks to build a successful AI team.",

    "abstract": "Ambient intelligence is increasingly finding applications in health-care settings, such as helping to ensure clinician and patient safety by monitoring staff compliance with clinical best practices or relieving staff of burdensome documentation tasks. Ambient intelligence involves using contactless sensors and contact-based wearable devices embedded in health-care settings to collect data (eg, imaging data of physical spaces, audio data, or body temperature), coupled with machine learning algorithms to efficiently and effectively interpret these data. Despite the promise of ambient intelligence to improve quality of care, the continuous collection of large amounts of sensor data in health-care settings presents ethical challenges, particularly in terms of privacy, data management, bias and fairness, and informed consent. Navigating these ethical issues is crucial not only for the success of individual uses, but for acceptance of the field as a whole.",

These on-body epidermal sensors can be integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) as augmented diagnostics tools for telehealth applications, especially for noninvasive health monitoring without using blood contents. One of many great benefits in utilizing sweat as biofluid is the capability of instantaneously continuous diagnosis during normal day-to-day activities.

    "abstract": "Within COVID-19 there is an urgent unmet need to predict at the time of hospital admission which COVID-19 patients will recover from the disease, and how fast they recover to deliver personalized treatments and to properly allocate hospital resources so that healthcare systems do not become overwhelmed. To this end, we have combined clinically salient CT imaging data synergistically with laboratory testing data in an integrative machine learning model to predict organ-specific recovery of patients from COVID-19. We trained and validated our model in 285 patients on each separate major organ system impacted by COVID-19 including the renal, pulmonary, immune, cardiac, and hepatic systems. To greatly enhance the speed and utility of our model, we applied an artificial intelligence method to segment and classify regions on CT imaging, from which interpretable data could be directly fed into the predictive machine learning model for overall recovery. Across all organ systems we achieved validation set area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) values for organ-specific recovery ranging from 0.80 to 0.89, and significant overall recovery prediction in Kaplan-Meier analyses. This demonstrates that the synergistic use of an artificial intelligence (AI) framework applied to CT lung imaging and a machine learning model that integrates laboratory test data with imaging data can accurately predict the overall recovery of COVID-19 patients from baseline characteristics.",

    "abstract": "To assess\u00a0a recently described CNN (convolutional neural network) DARC (Detection of Apoptosing Retinal Cells) algorithm in predicting new Subretinal Fluid (SRF) formation in Age-related-Macular-Degeneration (AMD).\nAnonymized DARC, baseline and serial OCT images (n\u00a0=\u00a0427) from 29 AMD eyes of Phase 2 clinical trial (ISRCTN10751859) were assessed with CNN algorithms, enabling the location of each DARC spot on corresponding OCT slices (n\u00a0=\u00a020,629). Assessment of DARC in a\u00a0rabbit model of angiogenesis was performed in parallel.\nA CNN DARC count >5 at baseline was significantly (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0156) related to development of new SRF throughout 36\u00a0months. Prediction rate of eyes using unique DARC spots overlying new SRF had positive predictive values, sensitivities and specificities >70%, with DARC count significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005) related to the magnitude of SRF accumulation at all time points. DARC identified earliest stages of angiogenesis in-vivo.\nDARC was able to predict new wet-AMD activity. Using only an OCT-CNN\u00a0definition of new SRF, we demonstrate that DARC can identify early endothelial neovascular activity, as confirmed by rabbit studies. Although larger validation studies are required, this shows the potential of DARC as a\u00a0biomarker of wet AMD, and potentially saving vision-loss.",

    "abstract": "The future of artificial intelligence (AI) heralds unprecedented change for the field of radiation oncology. Commercial vendors and academic institutions have created AI tools for radiation oncology, but such tools have not yet been widely adopted into clinical practice. In addition, numerous discussions have prompted careful thoughts about AI's impact upon the future landscape of radiation oncology: How can we preserve innovation, creativity, and patient safety? When will AI-based tools be widely adopted into the clinic? Will the need for clinical staff be reduced? How will these devices and tools be developed and regulated?\nIn this work, we examine how deep learning, a rapidly emerging subset of AI, fits into the broader historical context of advancements made in radiation oncology and medical physics. In addition, we examine a representative set of deep learning-based tools that are being made available for use in external beam radiotherapy treatment planning and how these deep learning-based tools and other AI-based tools will impact members of the radiation treatment planning team. Key Messages: Compared to past transformative innovations explored in this article, such as the Monte Carlo method or intensity-modulated radiotherapy, the development and adoption of deep learning-based tools is occurring at faster rates and promises to transform practices of the radiation treatment planning team. However, accessibility to these tools will be determined by each clinic's access to the internet, web-based solutions, or high-performance computing hardware. As seen by the trends exhibited by many technologies, high dependence on new technology can result in harm should the product fail in an unexpected manner, be misused by the operator, or if the mitigation to an expected failure is not adequate. Thus, the need for developers and researchers to rigorously validate deep learning-based tools, for users to understand how to operate tools appropriately, and for professional bodies to develop guidelines for their use and maintenance is essential. Given that members of the radiation treatment planning team perform many tasks that are automatable, the use of deep learning-based tools, in combination with other automated treatment planning tools, may refocus tasks performed by the treatment planning team and may potentially reduce resource-related burdens for clinics with limited resources.",

    "abstract": "Accurate assessment and early identification of gifted children is of great importance in terms of providing them with educational programs tailored for their abilities in specific areas. Individually administered intelligence tests are widely used to identify gifted children, and an above-average level of intellectual capacity is generally accepted as the main criterion for giftedness. This study aimed to investigate the utility of the Turkish version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) to distinguish gifted children from non-gifted children. For this purpose, 201 gifted children and 201 non-gifted children were included in the study. To be able to determine the predictive power of the WISC-IV index and subtest scores, logistic regression analyses were performed. Results indicated that the Perceptual Reasoning Index, Working Memory Index, and Processing Speed Index \u200b\u200bscores (except Verbal Comprehension Index score), and all subtest scores significantly predicted giftedness. Furthermore, correct classification rates among gifted children were 93% for index scores and 97% for subtest scores. The findings of this study suggest that intelligence scores obtained from the WISC-IV have a diagnostic utility and provide valid and reliable results in identifying gifted children.",

    "abstract": "It is generally agreed that variation in social and/or environmental complexity yields variation in selective pressures on brain anatomy, where more complex brains should yield increased intelligence. While these insights are based on many evolutionary studies, it remains unclear how ecology impacts brain plasticity and subsequently cognitive performance within a species. Here, we show that in wild cleaner fish (Labroides dimidiatus), forebrain size of high-performing individuals tested in an ephemeral reward task covaried positively with cleaner density, while cerebellum size covaried negatively with cleaner density. This unexpected relationship may be explained if we consider that performance in this task reflects the decision rules that individuals use in nature rather than learning abilities: cleaners with relatively larger forebrains used decision-rules that appeared to be locally optimal. Thus, social competence seems to be a suitable proxy of intelligence to understand individual differences under natural conditions.",

    "abstract": "Colposcopy diagnosis and directed biopsy are the key components in cervical cancer screening programs. However, their performance is limited by the requirement for experienced colposcopists. This study aimed to develop and validate a Colposcopic Artificial Intelligence Auxiliary Diagnostic System (CAIADS) for grading colposcopic impressions and guiding biopsies.\nAnonymized digital records of 19,435 patients were obtained from six hospitals across China. These records included colposcopic images, clinical information, and pathological results (gold standard). The data were randomly assigned (7:1:2) to a training and a tuning set for developing CAIADS and to a validation set for evaluating performance.\nThe agreement between CAIADS-graded colposcopic impressions and pathology findings was higher than that of colposcopies interpreted by colposcopists (82.2% versus 65.9%, kappa 0.750 versus 0.516, p\u2009<\u20090.001). For detecting pathological high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse (HSIL+), CAIADS showed higher sensitivity than the use of colposcopies interpreted by colposcopists at either biopsy threshold (low-grade or worse 90.5%, 95% CI 88.9-91.4% versus 83.5%, 81.5-85.3%; high-grade or worse 71.9%, 69.5-74.2% versus 60.4%, 57.9-62.9%; all p\u2009<\u20090.001), whereas the specificities were similar (low-grade or worse 51.8%, 49.8-53.8% versus 52.0%, 50.0-54.1%; high-grade or worse 93.9%, 92.9-94.9% versus 94.9%, 93.9-95.7%; all p\u2009>\u20090.05). The CAIADS also demonstrated a superior ability in predicting biopsy sites, with a median mean-intersection-over-union (mIoU) of 0.758.\nThe CAIADS has potential in assisting beginners and for improving the diagnostic quality of colposcopy and biopsy in the detection of cervical precancer/cancer.",

    "abstract": "Although the use of computational methods within the pharmaceutical industry is well established, there is an urgent need for new approaches that can improve and optimize the pipeline of drug discovery and development. In spite of the fact that there is no unique solution for this need for innovation, there has recently been a strong interest in the use of Artificial Intelligence for this purpose. As a matter of fact, not only there have been major contributions from the scientific community in this respect, but there has also been a growing partnership between the pharmaceutical industry and Artificial Intelligence companies. Beyond these contributions and efforts there is an underlying question, which we intend to discuss in this review: can the intrinsic difficulties within the drug discovery process be overcome with the implementation of Artificial Intelligence? While this is an open question, in this work we will focus on the advantages that these algorithms provide over the traditional methods in the context of early drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Online analytical processing (OLAP) approach is widely used in business intelligence to cater the multidimensional queries for decades. In this era of cutting-edge technology and the internet, data generation rates have been rising exponentially. Internet of things sensors and social media platforms are some of the major contributors, leading toward the absolute data boom. Storage and speed are the crucial parameters and undoubtedly the burning issues in efficient data handling. The key idea here is to address these two challenges of big data computing in OLAP. In this article, the authors have proposed and implemented OLAP on Hadoop by Indexing (OOHI). OOHI offers a simplified multidimensional model that stores dimensions in the schema server and measures on the Hadoop cluster. Overall setup is divided into various modules, namely: data storage module (DSM), dimension encoding module (DEM), cube segmentation module, segment selection module (SSM), and block selection and process (BSAP) module. Serialization and deserialization concept applied by DSM for storage and retrieval of the data for efficient space utilization. Integer encoding adopted by DEM in dimension hierarchy is selected to escape sparsity problem in multidimensional big data. To reduce search space by chunks of the cube from the queried chunks, SSM plays an important role. Map reduce-based indexing approach and series of seek operations of BSAP module were integrated to achieve parallelism and fault tolerance. Real-time oceanography data and supermarket data sets are applied to demonstrate that OOHI model is data independent. Various test cases are designed to cover the scope of each dimension and volume of data set. Comparative results and performance analytics portray that OOHI outperforms in data storage, dice, slice, and roll-up operations compared with Hadoop based OLAP.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence (AI) application evaluating of the impacted third molar teeth in Cone-beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images.\nIn total, 130 third molar teeth (65 patients) were included in this retrospective study. Impaction detection, Impacted tooth numbers, root/canal numbers of teeth, relationship with adjacent anatomical structures (inferior alveolar canal and maxillary sinus) were compared between the human observer and AI application. Recorded parameters agreement between the human observer and AI application based on the deep-CNN system was evaluated using the Kappa analysis.\nIn total, 112 teeth (86.2%) were detected as impacted by AI. The number of roots was correctly determined in 99 teeth (78.6%) and the number of canals in 82 teeth (68.1%). There was a good agreement in the determination of the inferior alveolar canal in relation to the mandibular impacted third molars (kappa: 0.762) as well as the number of roots detection (kappa: 0.620). Similarly, there was an excellent agreement in relation to maxillary impacted third molar and the maxillary sinus (kappa: 0.860). For the maxillary molar canal number detection, a moderate agreement was found between the human observer and AI examinations (kappa: 0.424).\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) application showed high accuracy values in the detection of impacted third molar teeth and their relationship to anatomical structures.",

    "abstract": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) has had a profound impact on areas such as image recognition, comparable advances in drug discovery are rare. This article quantifies the stages of drug discovery in which improvements in the time taken, success rate or affordability will have the most profound overall impact on bringing new drugs to market. Changes in clinical success rates will have the most profound impact on improving success in drug discovery; in other words, the quality of decisions regarding which compound to take forward (and how to conduct clinical trials) are more important than speed or cost. Although current advances in AI focus on how to make a given compound, the question of which compound to make, using clinical efficacy and safety-related end points, has received significantly less attention. As a consequence, current proxy measures and available data cannot fully utilize the potential of AI in drug discovery, in particular when it comes to drug efficacy and safety in vivo. Thus, addressing the questions of which data to generate and which end points to model will be key to improving clinically relevant decision-making in the future.",

Predictions given by the Tibot AI application were compared with diagnosis done by the dermatologist. The performance of AI application was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall.\nData of 398 patients were included in the application of whom 159 (39.9%) had fungal infections. Other conditions included eczema 36 (9%), alopecia 28 (7%), infestations 27 (6.8%), acne 25 (6.3%), psoriasis 19 (4.8%), benign tumors 7 (1.8%), bacterial infection 19 (4.8%), viral infection 15 (3.8%), and pigmentary disorders 20 (5%). The prediction accuracy (ability to get diagnosis in top three conditions) for alopecia, fungal infections, and eczema was 100%, 95.6%, and 91.7%, respectively. Mean prediction accuracy for correct diagnosis in the predicted top three diagnoses was 85.2%, and for correct diagnosis was 60.7%. Sensitivity and specificity of the application were approximately 86% and 98%, respectively. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of the application to diagnose alopecia was 100% and for fungal infections it was 96.85% and 90.05%, respectively.\nIn the preliminary stages, AI application tool showed promising results in diagnosing skin conditions. The accuracy and predictive value of the test may improve with the expansion of the database.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has surpassed dermatologists in skin cancer detection, but dermatology still lags behind radiology in its broader adoption. Building and using AI applications are becoming increasingly accessible. However, complex use cases may still require specialized expertise for design and deployment. AI has many applications in dermatology ranging from fundamental research, diagnostics, therapeutics, and cosmetic dermatology. The lack of standardization of images and privacy concerns are the foremost challenges stifling AI adoption. Dermatologists have a significant role to play in standardized data collection, curating data for machine learning, clinically validating AI solutions, and ultimately adopting this paradigm shift that is changing the way we practice.",

    "abstract": "Faced with an unprecedented amount of data coming from evermore ubiquitous sensors, the wastewater treatment community has been hard at work to develop new monitoring systems, models and controllers to bridge the gap between current practice and data-driven, smart water systems. For additional sensor data and models to have an appreciable impact, however, they must be relevant enough to be looked at by busy water professionals; be clear enough to be understood; be reliable enough to be believed and be convincing enough to be acted upon. Failure to attain any one of those aspects can be a fatal blow to the adoption of even the most promising new measurement technology. This review paper examines the state-of-the-art in the transformation of raw data into actionable insight, specifically for water resource recovery facility (WRRF) operation. Sources of difficulties found along the way are pinpointed, while also exploring possible paths towards improving the value of collected data for all stakeholders, i.e., all personnel that have a stake in the good and efficient operation of a WRRF.",

    "abstract": "Forensic odontology (FO) mainly deals with the identification of the individual through the remains, which mainly includes teeth and jawbones. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has proven to be a breakthrough in providing reliable information in decision making in forensic sciences. This systematic review aimed to report on the application and performance of AI technology in FO. The data was gathered through searching for the articles in the renowned search engines, which have been published between January 2000 - June 2020. QUADAS-2 was adopted for the risk of bias analysis of the included studies. AI technology has been widely applied in FO for identifying bite-marks, predicting mandibular morphology, gender determination, and age estimation. Most of these AI models are based on either artificial neural networks (ANNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results of the studies are promising. Studies have reported that these models display accuracy and precision equivalent to that of the trained examiners. These models can be promising tools when identifying victims of mass disasters and as an additive aid in medico-legal situations.",

Data were extracted and charted using an extraction tool and themes were explored using narrative analysis.\nThe review process resulted in the inclusion of four published studies. All studies used mixed methods and used artificial intelligence within clinical simulations as an intervention. No studies using virtual reality for pain education met the inclusion criteria. Participants of three studies were undergraduate nursing students in universities and participants in the fourth study were registered nurses within a hospital. Outcomes measured were user acceptance of the technology and feasibility in all studies. The context was hospital located and focused on acute pain episodes, with one exception being sickle cell pain. Three studies had adult patients and the other pediatric patients. The exclusion of input from a patient perspective was notable, as was a lack of interdisciplinary involvement.\nNurses are integral to the assessment and management of pain in many care settings requiring comprehensive communication and clinical skills. There is a paucity of research on the use of virtual reality or artificial intelligence in pain education for nurses. Current studies are preliminary in nature and/or pilot studies.

    "abstract": "The implementation of renewable energies is among the main challenges that we are confronting in the present situation of climate change. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) is optimized and used to assess the wave energy resource available to a wave farm over its service life. We select as case study a stretch of coastline in southern Spain. Different ANN architectures and training algorithms are tested for a dataset in deep water composed by: three values of significant wave height, four values of peak period, two values of incoming wave direction, three astronomical tide values, three storm surge values and three values of sea level rise induced by climate change. These deep-water sea states were propagated using a numerical model (Delft3D-Wave) and results were obtained at 176 locations. Thus, more than 114,000 data were used to train and test the ANNs. Once validated, the ANN was used to assess the cumulative wave energy at 704 locations during a 25-year period for three scenarios of rise in sea level according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports: present situation, pessimistic IPCC projection and optimistic IPCC projection. According to the results, the cumulative wave energy in the case study increases with increasing water depths. The greatest values of cumulative wave energy are reached at great depths off a shoreline horn and a port. Importantly, the rise in sea level will induce an increase in the wave energy resource. The ANN developed in this work allows the quantification of wave energy over long-term periods, reducing the computational cost, as well as the choice of the best locations for wave farms considering the effects of climate change.",

    "abstract": "Advancement of accurate models for predicting real estate price is of utmost importance for urban development and several critical economic functions. Due to the significant uncertainties and dynamic variables, modeling real estate has been studied as complex systems. In this study, a novel machine learning method is proposed to tackle real estate modeling complexity. Call detail records (CDR) provides excellent opportunities for in-depth investigation of the mobility characterization. This study explores the CDR potential for predicting the real estate price with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI). Several essential mobility entropy factors, including dweller entropy, dweller gyration, workers' entropy, worker gyration, dwellers' work distance, and workers' home distance, are used as input variables. The prediction model is developed using the machine learning method of multi-layered perceptron (MLP) trained with the evolutionary algorithm of particle swarm optimization (PSO). Model performance is evaluated using mean square error (MSE), sustainability index (SI), and Willmott's index (WI). The proposed model showed promising results revealing that the workers' entropy and the dwellers' work distances directly influence the real estate price. However, the dweller gyration, dweller entropy, workers' gyration, and the workers' home had a minimum effect on the price. Furthermore, it is shown that the flow of activities and entropy of mobility are often associated with the regions with lower real estate prices.",

    "abstract": "One of the serious mental disorders where people interpret reality in an abnormal state is schizophrenia. A combination of extremely disordered thinking, delusion, and hallucination is caused due to schizophrenia, and the daily functions of a person are severely disturbed because of this disorder. A wide range of problems are caused due to schizophrenia such as disturbed thinking and behaviour. In the field of human neuroscience, the analysis of brain activity is quite an important research area. For general cognitive activity analysis, electroencephalography (EEG) signals are widely used as a low-resolution diagnosis tool. The EEG signals are a great boon to understand the abnormality of the brain disorders, especially schizophrenia. In this work, schizophrenia EEG signal classification is performed wherein, initially, features such as Detrend Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Hurst Exponent, Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), Sample Entropy, Fractal Dimension (FD), Kolmogorov Complexity, Hjorth exponent, Lempel Ziv Complexity (LZC), and Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE) are extracted initially. The extracted features are, then, optimized for selecting the best features through four types of optimization algorithms here such as Artificial Flora (AF) optimization, Glowworm Search (GS) optimization, Black Hole (BH) optimization, and Monkey Search (MS) optimization, and finally, it is classified through certain classifiers. The best results show that, for normal cases, a classification accuracy of 87.54% is obtained when BH optimization is utilized with Support Vector Machine-Radial Basis Function (SVM-RBF) kernel, and for schizophrenia cases, a classification accuracy of 92.17% is obtained when BH optimization is utilized with SVM-RBF kernel.",

    "abstract": "AI is becoming ubiquitous, revolutionizing many aspects of our lives. In surgery, it is still a promise. AI has the potential to improve surgeon performance and impact patient care, from post-operative debrief to real-time decision support. But, how much data is needed by an AI-based system to learn surgical context with high fidelity? To answer this question, we leveraged a large-scale, diverse, cholecystectomy video dataset. We assessed surgical workflow recognition and report a deep learning system, that not only detects surgical phases, but does so with high accuracy and is able to generalize to new settings and unseen medical centers. Our findings provide a solid foundation for translating AI applications from research to practice, ushering in a new era of surgical intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Mammography is the current standard for breast cancer screening. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for diagnosis of breast cancer in mammography, and explore whether it could benefit radiologists by improving accuracy of diagnosis.\nIn this retrospective study, an AI algorithm was developed and validated with 170\u2008230 mammography examinations collected from five institutions in South Korea, the USA, and the UK, including 36\u2008468 cancer positive confirmed by biopsy, 59\u2008544 benign confirmed by biopsy (8827 mammograms) or follow-up imaging (50\u2008717 mammograms), and 74\u2008218 normal. For the multicentre, observer-blinded, reader study, 320 mammograms (160 cancer positive, 64 benign, 96 normal) were independently obtained from two institutions. 14 radiologists participated as readers and assessed each mammogram in terms of likelihood of malignancy (LOM), location of malignancy, and necessity to recall the patient, first without and then with assistance of the AI algorithm. The performance of AI and radiologists was evaluated in terms of LOM-based area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and recall-based sensitivity and specificity.\nThe AI standalone performance was AUROC 0\u00b7959 (95% CI 0\u00b7952-0\u00b7966) overall, and 0\u00b7970 (0\u00b7963-0\u00b7978) in the South Korea dataset, 0\u00b7953 (0\u00b7938-0\u00b7968) in the USA dataset, and 0\u00b7938 (0\u00b7918-0\u00b7958) in the UK dataset. In the reader study, the performance level of AI was 0\u00b7940 (0\u00b7915-0\u00b7965), significantly higher than that of the radiologists without AI assistance (0\u00b7810, 95% CI 0\u00b7770-0\u00b7850; p<0\u00b70001). With the assistance of AI, radiologists' performance was improved to 0\u00b7881 (0\u00b7850-0\u00b7911; p<0\u00b70001). AI was more sensitive to detect cancers with mass (53 [90%] vs 46 [78%] of 59 cancers detected; p=0\u00b7044) or distortion or asymmetry (18 [90%] vs ten [50%] of 20 cancers detected; p=0\u00b7023) than radiologists. AI was better in detection of T1 cancers (73 [91%] vs 59 [74%] of 80; p=0\u00b70039) or node-negative cancers (104 [87%] vs 88 [74%] of 119; p=0\u00b70025) than radiologists.\nThe AI algorithm developed with large-scale mammography data showed better diagnostic performance in breast cancer detection compared with radiologists. The significant improvement in radiologists' performance when aided by AI supports application of AI to mammograms as a diagnostic support tool.\nLunit.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has identified the main predictors of being a victim of school bullying. This study focused on the phenomenon of school bullying and its relationship with self-perceived emotional intelligence. The main aim was to analyze the mediating effect of emotional attention, clarity, and repair in relation to school victimization. The sample was made up of 822 primary school pupils from 10 public schools. Data were collected through self-reports, exploring the profile of victims of school bullying, and the dimensions of self-perceived emotional intelligence (PEI). A multivariate analysis and multinomial regression showed a relationship between the two variables; the probability of being a victim of school bullying was 5.14 times higher among pupils with low clarity, 2.72 times higher among pupils with low repair, and 2.62 times higher among pupils with excessive attention. The results demonstrated that the better their emotional regulation and understanding, the less likely pupils are to be victims of school bullying. This confirmed that adequate emotional attention and excellent emotional clarity and repair are protective factors against victimization.",

    "abstract": "The automatic detection and counting of white blood cells (WBCs) play a vital role in the diagnosis of hematological diseases. Computer-aided methods are prevalent in the detection of WBCs because the manual process involves several complexities. In this article, a complete automatic detection algorithm to recognize the WBCs embedded in cluttered and complicated smear images of blood is designed.\nThe proposed algorithm uses the ellipse detection approach to approximate the presence of WBCs in the Blood. A newly designed artificial electric field algorithm with novel velocity and position bound (AEFA-C) is employed for this purpose. The problem of detection of WBCs is transformed into an optimization problem where the random candidate solutions (ellipses) are efficiently mapped. These candidate ellipses are mapped onto the edge map of the smear image, and a complete mapping is obtained using the AEFA-C algorithm.\nThe effectiveness of the AEFA-C based detector is tested over the 60 smear images of the blood, having all the five types of WBCs or leukocytes.

    "abstract": "The active cervical range of motion (aROM) is assessed by clinicians to inform their decision-making. Even with the ability of neck motion to discriminate injured from non-injured subjects, the mechanisms to explain recovery or persistence of WAD remain unclear. There are few studies of ROM examinations with precision tools using kinematics as predictive factors of recovery rate. The present paper will evaluate the performance of an artificial neural network (ANN) using kinematic variables to predict the overall change of aROM after a period of rehabilitation in WAD patients. To achieve this goal the neck kinematics of a cohort of 1082 WAD patients (55.1% females), with mean age 37.68 (SD 12.88) years old, from across Spain were used. Prediction variables were the kinematics recorded by the EBI\u00ae 5 in routine biomechanical assessments of these patients. These include normalized ROM, speed to peak and ROM coefficient of variation. The improvement of aROM was represented by the Neck Functional Holistic Analysis Score (NFHAS). A supervised multi-layer feed-forward ANN was created to predict the change in NFHAS. The selected architecture of the ANN showed a mean squared error of 308.07-272.75 confidence interval for a 95% in the Monte Carlo cross validation. The performance of the ANN was tested with a subsample of patients not used in the training. This comparison resulted in a medium correlation with R = 0.5. The trained neural network to predict the expected difference in NFHAS between baseline and follow up showed modest results. While the overall performance is moderately correlated, the error of this prediction is still too large to use the method in clinical practice. The addition of other clinically relevant factors could further improve prediction performance.",

    "abstract": "The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the healthcare field has occurred with little communication between computer scientists and doctors. The impact of AI on health outcomes and inequalities calls for health professionals and data scientists to make a collaborative effort to ensure historic health disparities are not encoded into the future. We present a study that evaluates bias in existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) models used in psychiatry and discuss how these biases may widen health inequalities. Our approach systematically evaluates each stage of model development to explore how biases arise from a clinical, data science and linguistic perspective.\nA literature review of the uses of NLP in mental health was carried out across multiple disciplinary databases with defined Mesh terms and keywords. Our primary analysis evaluated biases within 'GloVe' and 'Word2Vec' word embeddings. Euclidean distances were measured to assess relationships between psychiatric terms and demographic labels, and vector similarity functions were used to solve analogy questions relating to mental health.\nOur primary analysis of mental health terminology in GloVe and Word2Vec embeddings demonstrated significant biases with respect to religion, race, gender, nationality, sexuality and age. Our literature review returned 52 papers, of which none addressed all the areas of possible bias that we identify in model development. In addition, only one article existed on more than one research database, demonstrating the isolation of research within disciplinary silos and inhibiting cross-disciplinary collaboration or communication.\nOur findings are relevant to professionals who wish to minimize the health inequalities that may arise as a result of AI and data-driven algorithms. We offer primary research identifying biases within these technologies and provide recommendations for avoiding these harms in the future.",

AI has already been applied in ophthalmic diabetes care. AI-systems currently detect diabetic retinopathy in general practice with a high sensitivity and specificity. AI-systems for the screening, monitoring and treatment of age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma are promising and are still being developed. AI-algorithms, however, only perform tasks for which they have been specifically trained and highly depend on the data and reference-standard that were used to train the system in identifying a certain abnormality or disease. How the data and the gold standard were established and determined, influences the performance of the algorithm. Furthermore, interpretability of deep learning algorithms is still an ongoing issue. By highlighting on images the areas that were critical for the decision of the algorithm, users can gain more insight into how algorithms come to a particular result.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to propose a methodology for measuring user experience (UX) by using artificial intelligence-aided design (AIAD) technology in mobile application design. Unlike the traditional assistance design tools, AIAD focuses on the rational use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to measure and improve UX since conventional data collection methods (such as user interview and user observation) for user behavior data are inefficient and time-consuming. We propose to obtain user behavior data from logs of mobile application. In order to protect the privacy of users, only a few dimensions of information is used in the process of browsing and operating mobile application. The goal of the proposed methodology is to make the deep neural network model simulate the user's experience in the process of operating a mobile application as much as possible. We design and use projected pages of application to train neural networks for specific tasks. These projected pages consist of the click information of all users in the process of completing a certain task. Thus, features of user behavior can be aggregated and mapped in the connection layers and the hidden layers. Finally, the optimized design is executed on the social communication application to verify the efficiency of the proposed methodology.",

    "abstract": "Burnout is being experienced by medical students, residents, and practicing physicians at significant rates. Higher levels of Hardiness and Emotional Intelligence may protect individuals against burnout symptoms. Previous studies have shown both Hardiness and Emotional IntelIigence protect against detrimental effects of stress and can be adapted through training; however, there is limited research on how training programs affect both simultaneously. Therefore, the objective of this study was to define the association of Hardiness and Emotional Intelligence and their potential improvement through hyper realistic immersion simulation training in military medical students.\nParticipants in this study consisted of 68 second year medical students representing five medical schools who were concurrently enrolled in the United States military scholarship program. During a six day hyper-realistic surgical simulation training course, students rotated through different roles of a medical team and responded to several mass-casualty scenarios. Hardiness and Emotional Intelligence were assessed using the Hardiness Resilience Gauge (HRG) and the Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-I 2.0) respectively, at two time points: on arrival (pre-event) and after completion of the course (post-event).\nHardiness and Emotional Intelligence scores and sub scores consistently improved from pre-event to post-event assessments. No difference in training benefit was observed between genders but differences were observed by age where age was more often associated with Emotional Intelligence. In addition, factor analysis indicated that the HRG and EQ-I 2.0 assessment tools measured predominately different traits although they share some commonalities in some components.\nThis study indicates that Hardiness and Emotional Intelligence scores can be improved through immersion training in military medical students. Results from this study support the use of training course interventions and prompt the need for long term evaluation of improvement strategies on mitigating burnout symptoms.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the influence of social status on behavior in a modified dictator game (DG). Since the DG contains an inherent dominance gradient, we examined the relationship between dictator decisions and recipient status, which was operationalized by three social identities and an artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, we examined the predictive value of social dominance orientation (SDO) on the behavior of dictators toward the different social and non-social hierarchical recipients. A multilevel model analysis showed that recipients with the same status as the dictator benefited the most and the artificial intelligence the least. Furthermore, SDO, regardless of social status, predicted behavior toward recipients in such a way that higher dominance was associated with lower dictator offers. In summary, participants treated other persons of higher and lower status equally, those of equal status better and, above all, an algorithm worst. The large proportion of female participants and the limited variance of SDO should be taken into account with regard to the results of individual differences in SDO.",

Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and initially of non-severe type were retrospectively included. The initial CT scan on admission was used for imaging analysis. The presence of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and other findings were visually evaluated. CT severity score was calculated according to the extent of lesion involvement. In addition, AI based quantification of GGO and consolidation volume were also performed. 123 patients (mean age: 64.43\u2009\u00b1\u200914.02; 62 males) were included. GGO\u2009+\u2009consolidation was more frequently revealed in progress-to-severe group whereas pure GGO was more likely to be found in non-severe group. Compared to non-severe group, patients in progress-to-severe group had larger GGO volume (167.33\u2009\u00b1\u2009167.88\u00a0cm",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a disruptive technology that involves the use of computerised algorithms to dissect complicated data. Among the most promising clinical applications of AI is diagnostic imaging, and mounting attention is being directed at establishing and fine-tuning its performance to facilitate detection and quantification of a wide array of clinical conditions. Investigations leveraging computer-aided diagnostics have shown excellent accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of small radiographic abnormalities, with the potential to improve public health. However, outcome assessment in AI imaging studies is commonly defined by lesion detection while ignoring the type and biological aggressiveness of a lesion, which might create a skewed representation of AI's performance. Moreover, the use of non-patient-focused radiographic and pathological endpoints might enhance the estimated sensitivity at the expense of increasing false positives and possible overdiagnosis as a result of identifying minor changes that might reflect subclinical or indolent disease. We argue for refinement of AI imaging studies via consistent selection of clinically meaningful endpoints such as survival, symptoms, and need for treatment.",

    "abstract": "We examined the potential change in cancer detection when using an artificial intelligence (AI) cancer-detection software to triage certain screening examinations into a no radiologist work stream, and then after regular radiologist assessment of the remainder, triage certain screening examinations into an enhanced assessment work stream. The purpose of enhanced assessment was to simulate selection of women for more sensitive screening promoting early detection of cancers that would otherwise be diagnosed as interval cancers or as next-round screen-detected cancers. The aim of the study was to examine how AI could reduce radiologist workload and increase cancer detection.\nIn this retrospective simulation study, all women diagnosed with breast cancer who attended two consecutive screening rounds were included. Healthy women were randomly sampled from the same cohort; their observations were given elevated weight to mimic a frequency of 0\u00b77% incident cancer per screening interval. Based on the prediction score from a commercially available AI cancer detector, various cutoff points for the decision to channel women to the two new work streams were examined in terms of missed and additionally detected cancer.\n7364 women were included in the study sample: 547 were diagnosed with breast cancer and 6817 were healthy controls. When including 60%, 70%, or 80% of women with the lowest AI scores in the no radiologist stream, the proportion of screen-detected cancers that would have been missed were 0, 0\u00b73% (95% CI 0\u00b70-4\u00b73), or 2\u00b76% (1\u00b71-5\u00b74), respectively. When including 1% or 5% of women with the highest AI scores in the enhanced assessment stream, the potential additional cancer detection was 24 (12%) or 53 (27%) of 200 subsequent interval cancers, respectively, and 48 (14%) or 121 (35%) of 347 next-round screen-detected cancers, respectively.\nUsing a commercial AI cancer detector to triage mammograms into no radiologist assessment and enhanced assessment could potentially reduce radiologist workload by more than half, and pre-emptively detect a substantial proportion of cancers otherwise diagnosed later.\nStockholm City Council.",

    "abstract": "In February, 2020, the European Commission published a white paper on artificial intelligence (AI) as well as an accompanying communication and report. The paper sets out policy options to facilitate a secure and trustworthy development of AI and considers health to be one of its most important areas of application. We illustrate that the European Commission's approach, as applied to medical AI, presents some challenges that can be detrimental if not addressed. In particular, we discuss the issues of European values and European data, the update problem of AI systems, and the challenges of new trade-offs such as privacy, cybersecurity, accuracy, and intellectual property rights. We also outline what we view as the most important next steps in the Commission's iterative process. Although the European Commission has done good work in setting out a European approach for AI, we conclude that this approach will be more difficult to implement in health care. It will require careful balancing of core values, detailed consideration of nuances of health and AI technologies, and a keen eye on the political winds and global competition.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning is a novel machine learning technique that has been shown to be as effective as human graders in detecting diabetic retinopathy from fundus photographs. We used a cost-minimisation analysis to evaluate the potential savings of two deep learning approaches as compared with the current human assessment: a semi-automated deep learning model as a triage filter before secondary human assessment; and a fully automated deep learning model without human assessment.\nIn this economic analysis modelling study, using 39\u2008006 consecutive patients with diabetes in a national diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Singapore in 2015, we used a decision tree model and TreeAge Pro to compare the actual cost of screening this cohort with human graders against the simulated cost for semi-automated and fully automated screening models. Model parameters included diabetic retinopathy prevalence rates, diabetic retinopathy screening costs under each screening model, cost of medical consultation, and diagnostic performance (ie, sensitivity and specificity). The primary outcome was total cost for each screening model. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were done to gauge the sensitivity of the results to key model assumptions.\nFrom the health system perspective, the semi-automated screening model was the least expensive of the three models, at US$62 per patient per year. The fully automated model was $66 per patient per year, and the human assessment model was $77 per patient per year. The savings to the Singapore health system associated with switching to the semi-automated model are estimated to be $489\u2008000, which is roughly 20% of the current annual screening cost. By 2050, Singapore is projected to have 1 million people with diabetes; at this time, the estimated annual savings would be $15 million.\nThis study provides a strong economic rationale for using deep learning systems as an assistive tool to screen for diabetic retinopathy.\nMinistry of Health, Singapore.",

    "abstract": "The SPIRIT 2013 statement aims to improve the completeness of clinical trial protocol reporting by providing evidence-based recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed. This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human-AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret, and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "There is high demand to develop computer-assisted diagnostic tools to evaluate prostate core needle biopsies (CNBs), but little clinical validation and a lack of clinical deployment of such tools. We report here on a blinded clinical validation study and deployment of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm in a pathology laboratory for routine clinical use to aid prostate diagnosis.\nAn AI-based algorithm was developed using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides of prostate CNBs digitised with a Philips scanner, which were divided into training (1\u2008357\u2008480 image patches from 549 H&E-stained slides) and internal test (2501 H&E-stained slides) datasets. The algorithm provided slide-level scores for probability of cancer, Gleason score 7-10 (vs Gleason score 6 or atypical small acinar proliferation [ASAP]), Gleason pattern 5, and perineural invasion and calculation of cancer percentage present in CNB material. The algorithm was subsequently validated on an external dataset of 100 consecutive cases (1627 H&E-stained slides) digitised on an Aperio AT2 scanner. In addition, the AI tool was implemented in a pathology laboratory within routine clinical workflow as a second read system to review all prostate CNBs. Algorithm performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity, and sensitivity, as well as Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) for cancer percentage.\nThe algorithm achieved an AUC of 0\u00b7997 (95% CI 0\u00b7995 to 0\u00b7998) for cancer detection in the internal test set and 0\u00b7991 (0\u00b7979 to 1\u00b700) in the external validation set. The AUC for distinguishing between a low-grade (Gleason score 6 or ASAP) and high-grade (Gleason score 7-10) cancer diagnosis was 0\u00b7941 (0\u00b7905 to 0\u00b7977) and the AUC for detecting Gleason pattern 5 was 0\u00b7971 (0\u00b7943 to 0\u00b7998) in the external validation set. Cancer percentage calculated by pathologists and the algorithm showed good agreement (r=0\u00b7882, 95% CI 0\u00b7834 to 0\u00b7915; p<0\u00b70001) with a mean bias of -4\u00b714% (-6\u00b736 to -1\u00b791). The algorithm achieved an AUC of 0\u00b7957 (0\u00b7930 to 0\u00b7985) for perineural invasion. In routine practice, the algorithm was used to assess 11\u2008429 H&E-stained slides pertaining to 941 cases leading to 90 Gleason score 7-10 alerts and 560 cancer alerts. 51 (9%) cancer alerts led to additional cuts or stains being ordered, two (4%) of which led to a third opinion request. We report on the first case of missed cancer that was detected by the algorithm.\nThis study reports the successful development, external clinical validation, and deployment in clinical practice of an AI-based algorithm to accurately detect, grade, and evaluate clinically relevant findings in digitised slides of prostate CNBs.\nIbex Medical Analytics.",

    "abstract": "The studies about the effect of the graphene reinforcement ratio and machining parameters to improve the machining performance of Ti6Al4V alloy are still rare and incomplete to meet the Industry 4.0 manufacturing criteria. In this study, a hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with a multi-objective particle swarm optimization method is developed to obtain the optimal combination of milling parameters and reinforcement ratio that lead to minimize the feed force, depth force, and surface roughness. For achieving this, Ti6Al4V matrix nanocomposites reinforced with 0 wt.%, 0.6 wt.%, and 1.2 wt.% graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) are produced. Afterward, a full factorial approach was used to design experiments to investigate the effect of cutting speed, feed rate, and graphene nanoplatelets ratio on machining behaviour. After that, artificial intelligence based on ANFIS is used to develop prediction models as the fitness function of the multi-objective particle swarm optimization method. The experimental results showed that the developed models can obtain an accurate estimation of depth force, feed force, and surface roughness with a mean absolute percentage error of 3.87%, 8.56%, and 2.21%, respectively, as compared with experimentally measured outputs. In addition, the developed artificial intelligence models showed 361.24%, 35.05%, and 276.47% less errors for depth force, feed force, and surface roughness, respectively, as compared with the traditional mathematical models. The multi-objective optimization results from the new approach indicated that a cutting speed of 62 m/min, feed rate of 139 mm/min, and GNPs reinforcement ratio of 1.145 wt.% lead to the improved machining characteristics of GNPs reinforced Ti6Al4V matrix nanocomposites. Henceforth, the hybrid method as a novel artificial intelligent method can be used for optimizing the machining processes with complex relationships between the output responses.",

    "abstract": "The current theories suggest the fundamental role of semantic memory in creativity, mediating bottom-up (divergent thinking) and top-down (fluid intelligence) cognitive processes. However, the relationship between creativity, intelligence, and the organization of the semantic memory remains poorly-characterized in children. We investigated the ways in which individual differences in children's semantic memory structures are influenced by their divergent thinking and fluid intelligence abilities. The participants (mean age 10) were grouped by their levels (high/low) of divergent thinking and fluid intelligence. We applied a recently-developed Network Science approach in order to examine group-based semantic memory graphs. Networks were constructed from a semantic fluency task. The results revealed that divergent thinking abilities are related to a more flexible structure of the semantic network, while fluid intelligence corresponds to a more structured semantic network, in line with the previous findings from the adult sample. Our findings confirm the crucial role of semantic memory organization in creative performance, and demonstrate that this phenomenon can be traced back to childhood. Finally, we also corroborate the network science methodology as a valid approach to the study of creative cognition in the developmental population.",

    "abstract": "The article presents a systematic review protocol. The aim of the study is an assessment of current studies regarding the application of artificial intelligence and neural networks in the screening for adverse perinatal outcomes. We intend to compare the reported efficacy of these methods to improve pregnancy care and outcomes. There are more and more studies that describe the role of machine learning in facilitating the diagnosis of adverse perinatal outcomes, like gestational diabetes or pregnancy hypertension. A systematic review of available literature seems to be crucial to compare the known efficacy and application. Publication of a systematic review in this category would improve the value of future studies. The studies reporting on artificial intelligence application will have a major impact on future prenatal practice.",

    "abstract": "From cell phones to aerospace, artificial intelligence (AI) has wide-reaching influence in the modern age. In this review, we discuss the application of AI solutions to an equally ubiquitous problem in cytopathology - thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Thyroid nodules are common in the general population, and FNAB is the sampling modality of choice. The resulting prevalence in the practicing pathologist's daily workload makes thyroid FNAB an appealing target for the application of AI solutions.\nThis review summarizes all available literature on the application of AI to thyroid cytopathology. We follow the evolution from morphometric analysis to convolutional neural networks. We explore the application of AI technology to different questions in thyroid cytopathology, including distinguishing papillary carcinoma from benign, distinguishing follicular adenoma from carcinoma and identifying non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features by key words and phrases. Key Messages: The current literature shows promise towards the application of AI technology to thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy. Much work is needed to define how this powerful technology will be of best use to the future of cytopathology practice.",

    "abstract": "Advanced medical image analytics is increasingly used to predict clinical outcome in patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal tumors. This review provides an overview on the value of radiomics in predicting response to treatment in patients with gastrointestinal tumors.\nA systematic review was conducted, according to PRISMA guidelines. The protocol was prospectively registered (PROSPERO: CRD42019128408). PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched. Original studies reporting on the value of radiomics in predicting response to treatment in patients with a gastrointestinal tumor were included. A narrative synthesis of results was conducted. Results were stratified by tumor type. Quality assessment of included studies was performed, according to the radiomics quality score.\nThe comprehensive literature search identified 1360 unique studies, of which 60 articles were included for analysis. In 37 studies, radiomics models and individual radiomic features showed good predictive performance for response to treatment (area under the curve or accuracy >\u20090.75). Various strategies to construct predictive models were used. Internal validation of predictive models was often performed, while the majority of studies lacked external validation. None of the studies reported predictive models implemented in clinical practice.\nRadiomics is increasingly used to predict response to treatment in patients suffering from gastrointestinal cancer. This review demonstrates its great potential to help predict response to treatment and improve patient selection and early adjustment of treatment strategy in a non-invasive manner.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making a continuous progression into the field of Radiation Oncology in Canada and globally. While this field continues to evolve, there is no clear understanding about how radiation oncologists, radiation therapists, medical physicists and radiation trainees perceive AI and its' impact on radiation oncology as a discipline. The purpose of this study was to investigate the perception of these four Canadian professional groups about AI. and how AI will affect radiation oncology as a specialty.\nFollowing an in-depth scientific review of the existing literature, a 29 Likert-scale questionnaire was developed using Google Survey. The questionnaire was piloted and distributed through national organizations including the Canadian Association for Radiation Oncology (CARO), the Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Therapy (CAMRT) and the Canadian Organization of Medical Physicists (COMP), initially in February, and again between March and June 2020. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.\n159 responses were received from 10 Canadian provinces. Knowledge about AI was moderate with an average of 5/10, but 91% responded interest in learning more about it. The negative implications of AI were related to fear of losing jobs and shift of practice. The majority of participants agreed AI would positively impact on patient treatment.\nRadiation oncology professionals believe AI will be an important part of patient treatment in their future practices. The fear about AI may be mitigated with further education programs about AI, which can gain more confidence in the acceptance of AI.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based applications have transformed several industries and are widely used in various consumer products and services. In medicine, AI is primarily being used for image classification and natural language processing and has great potential to affect image-based specialties such as radiology, pathology, and gastroenterology (GE). This document reviews the reported applications of AI in GE, focusing on endoscopic image analysis.\nThe MEDLINE database was searched through May 2020 for relevant articles by using key words such as machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, computer-aided diagnosis, convolutional neural networks, GI endoscopy, and endoscopic image analysis. References and citations of the retrieved articles were also evaluated to identify pertinent studies. The manuscript was drafted by 2 authors and reviewed in person by members of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Technology Committee and subsequently by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Governing Board.\nDeep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks have been used in several areas of GI endoscopy, including colorectal polyp detection and classification, analysis of endoscopic images for diagnosis of \nThe implementation of AI technologies across multiple GI endoscopic applications has the potential to transform clinical practice favorably and improve the efficiency and accuracy of current diagnostic methods.",

    "abstract": "To date, little knowledge exists about perceived stress or emotional intelligence among Saudi students specialising in health sciences. This study uses sociodemographic factors to assess the correlations and divergences between emotional intelligence and perceived stress among health-science students in Saudi applied health-science colleges.\nThe present study adopted a cross-sectional, descriptive correlational design and recruited a convenience sample of 274 nursing and paramedic students. The participants were invited to complete a self-report questionnaire, which covered demographic factors, emotional intelligence (the MindTools test), and perceived stress (the Perceived Stress Scale).\nAlmost all participants (97.1%) had average-to-high levels of emotional intelligence (mean\u00a0=\u00a050.58 in a 15-75 ranged scale); this was particularly true for nursing students and students in their first and third academic years. Overall, the students had a moderate level of perceived stress (mean\u00a0=\u00a01.75 in a 0-4 ranged scale), with assignments and workload causing the highest levels of stress. A negative non-significant correlation was found between emotional intelligence and perceived stress.\nThe research findings show that emotional intelligence does not differ significantly by nationality, gender, or specialty satisfaction. The students' gender, nationality, specialty, specialty satisfaction, and academic year were not significantly associated with levels of perceived stress. However, higher (although non-significant) levels of emotional intelligence were associated with lower levels of perceived stress. It is therefore essential to educate health-science students about emotional intelligence and teach them to identify and overcome stressors. Information about emotional intelligence and perceived stress should be incorporated into health-science curricula.\n\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0648\u062c\u062f \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646

    "results": "Almost all participants (97.1%) had average-to-high levels of emotional intelligence (mean\u00a0=\u00a050.58 in a 15-75 ranged scale); this was particularly true for nursing students and students in their first and third academic years. Overall, the students had a moderate level of perceived stress (mean\u00a0=\u00a01.75 in a 0-4 ranged scale), with assignments and workload causing the highest levels of stress. A negative non-significant correlation was found between emotional intelligence and perceived stress.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 global pandemic is a threat not only to the health of millions of individuals, but also to the stability of infrastructure and economies around the world. The disease will inevitably place an overwhelming burden on healthcare systems that cannot be effectively dealt with by existing facilities or responses based on conventional approaches. We believe that a rigorous clinical and societal response can only be mounted by using intelligence derived from a variety of data sources to better utilize scarce healthcare resources, provide personalized patient management plans, inform policy, and expedite clinical trials. In this paper, we introduce five of the most important challenges in responding to COVID-19 and show how each of them can be addressed by recent developments in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that the integration of these techniques into local, national, and international healthcare systems will save lives, and propose specific methods by which implementation can happen swiftly and efficiently. We offer to extend these resources and knowledge to assist policymakers seeking to implement these techniques.",

    "abstract": "Youth involves a lot of mental health issues. A descriptive cross-sectional study was undertaken to determine the relationship between emotional intelligence, self-esteem, and assertiveness among 432 youth (18-23 years) from selected colleges of Udupi district, Karnataka using Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test, Rosenberg self-esteem scale, and Youth Assertiveness Scale. The mean emotional intelligence among youth was 124.99 \u00b1 18.71, whereas the mean self-esteem and assertiveness scores were 18.48 \u00b1 3.33 and 60.706 \u00b1 7.077, respectively. Linear relationships among the key variables were assessed using the Karl Pearson's correlation coefficient. Self-esteem and assertiveness showed a weak positive relationship (r = 0.282 and 0.288, P = 0.001 respectively) with emotional intelligence, whereas the relationship between self-esteem and assertiveness also revealed a positive relationship (r = 0.367, P = 0.001). The significant correlation between these variables indicates a need for regular assessment among the youth. Rising self-esteem and training in assertiveness help the individual to use his emotions wisely and improve emotional intelligence.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of asthma in Chinese children has rapidly increased as a result of inadequate management. This is mainly due to the failure of many primary-level pediatricians to distinguish asthma from common respiratory diseases, such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Such misdiagnoses often lead to the abuse of antibiotics and systemic glucocorticoids. Additionally, if asthma is not diagnosed early, chronic airway inflammation results in lesions that not only hamper children's athletic abilities, but serve as the primary cause for adult chronic airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nA number of machine learning-based models including CatBoost, Logistic Regression, Na\u00efve Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been developed to identify asthma via utilizing retrospective electronic medical records (EMRs) of patients. These models were evaluated independently using EMRs from both the Pulmonology Department and other departments of the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China.\nTwo independent test sets were applied for performance evaluation. TestSet-1 consisted of 325 positive asthma cases and 428 negative cases from the Pulmonology Department. TestSet-2 was composed of 2,123 cases from non-pulmonology departments, and included 337 positive and 1,786 negative cases. Experimental results showed that the CatBoost model outperformed other models on both test sets with an accuracy of 84.7% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 90.9% on TestSet-1, and an accuracy of 96.7% and an AUC of 98.1% on TestSet-2.\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) model could rapidly and accurately identify asthma in general medical wards of children, and may aid primary pediatricians in the correct diagnoses of asthma. It possesses great clinical value and practical significance in improving the control rate of asthma in children, optimizing medical resources, and limiting the abuse of antibiotics and systemic glucocorticoids.",

    "abstract": "Oral cancer is the sixth most prevalent cancer worldwide. Public knowledge in oral cancer risk factors and survival is limited.\nTo come up with machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the length of survival for individuals diagnosed with oral cancer, and to explore the most important factors that were responsible for shortening or lengthening oral cancer survival.\nWe used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from the years 1975 to 2016 that consisted of a total of 257880 cases and 94 variables. Four ML techniques in the area of artificial intelligence were applied for model training and validation. Model accuracy was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), \nThe most important factors predictive of oral cancer survival time were age at diagnosis, primary cancer site, tumor size and year of diagnosis. Year of diagnosis referred to the year when the tumor was first diagnosed, implying that individuals with tumors that were diagnosed in the modern era tend to have longer survival than those diagnosed in the past. The extreme gradient boosting ML algorithms showed the best performance, with the MAE equaled to 13.55, MSE 486.55 and RMSE 22.06.\nUsing artificial intelligence, we developed a tool that can be used for oral cancer survival prediction and for medical-decision making. The finding relating to the year of diagnosis represented an important new discovery in the literature. The results of this study have implications for cancer prevention and education for the public.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to inorganic arsenic through drinking water is a threat for public health. Using the arsenic-containing water in the long-term causes a variety of skin diseases, high blood pressure, and skin cancer. Arsenic also damages the nervous system. A wide range of studies have studied the effect of arsenic in drinking water on the level of intelligence in children.\nFor the purpose of our research, we searched three electronic databases including Scopus, Web of Science, and Medline (PubMed) in English from 2000 to January 2018. We used the dose-response meta-analysis through applying random effect models in order to estimate the pooled association (with a 95% uncertainty) between water arsenic concentration and intelligence level.\nUsing a two-stage random effect model to investigate the dose-response association between arsenic concentration and Intelligence Quotient scale, we estimated a significant linear association as -0.08 (95% CI: -0.14, -0.01). Actually, for each unit increase in arsenic concentration (one microgram per liter), intelligence quotient scale decreases by 0.08%.\nConsidering the significance of the relationship between arsenic concentration in drinking water and the level of intelligence quotient as an important factor in training, the level of arsenic and its associated risks should be decreased in water resources.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has huge potential to improve the health and well-being of people, but adoption in clinical practice is still limited. Lack of transparency is identified as one of the main barriers to implementation, as clinicians should be confident the AI system can be trusted. Explainable AI has the potential to overcome this issue and can be a step towards trustworthy AI. In this paper we review the recent literature to provide guidance to researchers and practitioners on the design of explainable AI systems for the health-care domain and contribute to formalization of the field of explainable AI. We argue the reason to demand explainability determines what should be explained as this determines the relative importance of the properties of explainability (i.e. interpretability and fidelity). Based on this, we propose a framework to guide the choice between classes of explainable AI methods (explainable modelling versus post-hoc explanation; model-based, attribution-based, or example-based explanations; global and local explanations). Furthermore, we find that quantitative evaluation metrics, which are important for objective standardized evaluation, are still lacking for some properties (e.g. clarity) and types of explanations (e.g. example-based methods). We conclude that explainable modelling can contribute to trustworthy AI, but the benefits of explainability still need to be proven in practice and complementary measures might be needed to create trustworthy AI in health care (e.g. reporting data quality, performing extensive (external) validation, and regulation).",

    "abstract": "This review describes the steps and conclusions from the development and validation of an artificial intelligence algorithm (the Hypotension Prediction Index), one of the first machine learning predictive algorithms used in the operating room environment. The algorithm has been demonstrated to reduce intraoperative hypotension in two randomized controlled trials via real-time prediction of upcoming hypotensive events prompting anesthesiologists to act earlier, more often, and differently in managing impending hypotension. However, the algorithm entails no dynamic learning process that evolves from use in clinical patient care, meaning the algorithm is fixed, and furthermore provides no insight into the decisional process that leads to an early warning for intraoperative hypotension, which makes the algorithm a \"black box.\" Many other artificial intelligence machine learning algorithms have these same disadvantages. Clinical validation of such algorithms is relatively new and requires more standardization, as guidelines are lacking or only now start to be drafted. Before adaptation in clinical practice, impact of artificial intelligence algorithms on clinical behavior, outcomes and economic advantages should be studied too.",

    "abstract": "Corpus callosotomy (CC) is an established surgical option for palliative treatment of medically intractable epilepsy, especially for seizures with drop attacks. We postulated that specific risk factors for post-CC transient disturbance of consciousness (pCTDC) are associated with CC. The purpose of this study was to review patients with intractable epilepsy who underwent CC and to statistically analyze risk factors for pCTDC.\nInclusion criteria for patients who underwent CC between January 2009 and November 2019 were: (1) \u22652\u202fyears old and (2) followed up for more than 8\u202fmonths. The state of consciousness before and after CC was evaluated with the Glasgow coma scale. We statistically assessed predictors for pCTDC as the primary outcome.\nFifty-six patients (19 females, 37 males) were enrolled, and the age range was 2-57\u202fyears old. Thirty-seven (66.1%) patients developed pCTDC. The mean period from the beginning of the state of pCTDC to recovery to their baseline conscious level was 4.9\u202fdays (range: 2-25\u202fdays). All three (100%) normal intelligence level patients, 13 (81%) of 16 patients with a moderately impaired level of intelligence, and 21 (57%) of 37 patients with a severely impaired level of intelligence exhibited pCTDC. Univariate (p\u202f=\u202f0.044) and multivariate (p\u202f=\u202f0.006) logistic regression analyses for predictors of pCTDC showed that intellectual function was statistically significant.\nTwo-thirds of patients developed pCTDC. One risk factor for pCTDC may be higher intellectual function.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have found that emotional intelligence has a remarkable influence on authentic leadership. However, the conceivable relationship between emotional intelligence and authentic leadership was unclear, as were the hypothetical bases used in previous studies.\nTo determine the correlation between emotional intelligence and authentic leadership of the nursing leaders and the socio-demographic characteristics by which emotional intelligence and authentic leadership vary.\nData derived from 152 of the distributed 180 questionnaires were analyzed (84.44% response rate). Nurse leaders in the academy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were assessed from April to July of 2019. t-Tests were used to test gender differences, while the Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were employed for age, position, and years of experience. The relationship between the emotional intelligence and authentic leadership scores was analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficients (bivariate r). The relationships of the four dimensions in the emotional intelligence construct and overall emotional intelligence were assessed using multiple regression analysis and simple linear regression analysis.\nAge and years of experience significantly and positively related to emotional intelligence, whereas gender, age, and years of experience in the current position (p\u202f=\u202f0.026) were significant regarding authentic leadership. The emotional intelligence total score strongly and positively related to authentic leadership. The regression results on the four emotional intelligence dimensions indicated that the extent of using emotions had the strongest influence on authentic leadership (B\u202f=\u202f0.99) followed by appraisal of one's emotions (B\u202f=\u202f0.70) and appraisal of others' emotions (B\u202f=\u202f0.69). The simple regression analysis indicated that, for every one-point increase in total emotional intelligence score, authentic leadership score increased by 0.086.\nAge and years of experience were significant factors explaining variation in emotional intelligence, whereas gender, age, and years of experience in the current position were significant for explaining variation in authentic leadership. Using emotions was the strongest influence on authentic leadership, and the emotional intelligence dimension measuring regulation of emotion had no significant influence on authentic leadership.",

Early and correct diagnosis of glaucoma can prevent irreversible vision loss and glaucomatous structural damages to the eye.

Artificial intelligence coupled with optical coherence tomography imaging creates an algorithm that can be effectively used to make a model of complex data for detection as well as diagnosis of glaucoma. The present review is an attempt to provide state-of-the-art information on various AI techniques used in the diagnosis and assessment of glaucoma. The second part of the review is focused on understanding how the AI along with machine learning (ML) can be potentially used to be subjected for software as a medical device (SaMD) in precise diagnosis or early detection of disease conditions.",

    "abstract": "Memristive devices share remarkable similarities to biological synapses, dendrites, and neurons at both the physical mechanism level and unit functionality level, making the memristive approach to neuromorphic computing a promising technology for future artificial intelligence. However, these similarities do not directly transfer to the success of efficient computation without device and algorithm co-designs and optimizations. Contemporary deep learning algorithms demand the memristive artificial synapses to ideally possess analog weighting and linear weight-update behavior, requiring substantial device-level and circuit-level optimization. Such co-design and optimization have been the main focus of memristive neuromorphic engineering, which often abandons the \"non-ideal\" behaviors of memristive devices, although many of them resemble what have been observed in biological components. Novel brain-inspired algorithms are being proposed to utilize such behaviors as unique features to further enhance the efficiency and intelligence of neuromorphic computing, which calls for collaborations among electrical engineers, computing scientists, and neuroscientists.",

    "abstract": "We combined clinical practice changes, standardizations, and technology to automate aggregation, integration, and harmonization of comprehensive patient data from the multiple source systems used in clinical practice into a big data analytics resource system (BDARS). We then developed novel artificial intelligence algorithms, coupled with the BDARS, to identify structure dose volume histograms (DVH) metrics associated with dysphagia.\nFrom the BDARS harmonized data of \u226522,000 patients, we identified 132 patients recently treated for head and neck cancer who also demonstrated dysphagia scores that worsened from base line to a maximum grade \u22652. We developed a method that used both physical and biologically corrected (\u03b1/\u03b2 = 2.5) DVH curves to test both absolute and percentage volume based DVH metrics. Combining a statistical categorization algorithm with machine learning (SCA-ML) provided more extensive detailing of response threshold evidence than either approach alone. A sensitivity guided, minimum input, machine learning (ML) model was iteratively constructed to identify the key structure DVH metric thresholds.\nSeven swallowing structures producing 738 candidate DVH metrics were ranked for association with dysphagia using SCA-ML scoring. Structures included superior pharyngeal constrictor (SPC), inferior pharyngeal constrictor (IPC), larynx, and esophagus. Bilateral parotid and submandibular gland (SG) structures were categorized by relative mean dose (eg, SG_high, SG_low) as a dose versus tumor centric analog to contra and ipsilateral designations. Structure DVH metrics with high SCA-ML scores included the following: SPC: D20% (equivalent dose [EQD2] Gy) \u226547.7; SPC: D25% (Gy) \u226550.4; IPC: D35% (Gy) \u226561.7; parotid_low: D60% (Gy) \u226513.2; and SG_high: D35% (Gy) \u226561.7. Larynx: D25% (Gy) \u226521.2 and SG_low: D45% \u226528.2 had high SCA-ML scores but were segmented on less than 90% of plans. A model based on SPC: D20% (EQD2 Gy) alone had sensitivity and area under the curve of 0.88 \u00b1 0.13 and 0.74 \u00b1 0.17, respectively.\nThis study provides practical demonstration of combining big data with artificial intelligence to increase volume of evidence in clinical learning paradigms.",

Bilateral parotid and submandibular gland (SG) structures were categorized by relative mean dose (eg, SG_high, SG_low) as a dose versus tumor centric analog to contra and ipsilateral designations. Structure DVH metrics with high SCA-ML scores included the following: SPC: D20% (equivalent dose [EQD2] Gy) \u226547.7; SPC: D25% (Gy) \u226550.4; IPC: D35% (Gy) \u226561.7; parotid_low: D60% (Gy) \u226513.2; and SG_high: D35% (Gy) \u226561.7. Larynx: D25% (Gy) \u226521.2 and SG_low: D45% \u226528.2 had high SCA-ML scores but were segmented on less than 90% of plans. A model based on SPC: D20% (EQD2 Gy) alone had sensitivity and area under the curve of 0.88 \u00b1 0.13 and 0.74 \u00b1 0.17, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Although many researchers talk about a \"patient database,\" they typically are not referring to a database at all, but instead to a spreadsheet of curated facts about a cohort of patients. This article describes relational database systems and how they differ from spreadsheets. At their core, spreadsheets are only capable of describing one-to-one (1:1) relationships. However, this article demonstrates that clinical medical data encapsulate numerous one-to-many relationships. Consequently, spreadsheets are very inefficient relative to relational database systems, which gracefully manage such data. Databases provide other advantages, in that the data fields are \"typed\" (that is, they contain specific kinds of data). This prevents users from entering spurious data during data import. Because each record contains a \"key,\" it becomes impossible to add duplicate information (ie, add the same patient twice). Databases store data in very efficient ways, minimizing space and memory requirements on the host system. Likewise, databases can be queried or manipulated using a highly complex language called SQL. Consequently, it becomes trivial to cull large amounts of data from a vast number of data fields on very precise subsets of patients. Databases can be quite large (terabytes or more in size), yet still are highly efficient to query. Consequently, with the explosion of data available in electronic health records and other data sources, databases become increasingly important to contain or order these data. Ultimately, this will enable the clinical researcher to perform artificial intelligence analyses across vast amounts of clinical data in a way heretofore impossible. This article provides initial guidance in terms of creating a relational database system.",

    "abstract": "Homology modeling is a method for building protein 3D structures using protein primary sequence and utilizing prior knowledge gained from structural similarities with other proteins. The homology modeling process is done in sequential steps where sequence/structure alignment is optimized, then a backbone is built and later, side-chains are added. Once the low-homology loops are modeled, the whole 3D structure is optimized and validated. In the past three decades, a few collective and collaborative initiatives allowed for continuous progress in both homology and ",

Imaging methods are important and indispensable of GISTs in diagnosis, risk staging, therapy, and follow-up. The recommended imaging method for staging and follow-up is computed tomography (CT) according to current guidelines. Artificial intelligence (AI) applies and elaborates theses, procedures, modes, and utilization systems for simulating, enlarging, and stretching the intellectual capacity of humans. Recently, researchers have done a few studies to explore AI applications in GIST imaging.

    "abstract": "Aging clocks that accurately predict human age based on various biodata types are among the most important recent advances in biogerontology. Since 2016 multiple deep learning solutions have been created to interpret facial photos, omics data, and clinical blood parameters in the context of aging. Some of them have been patented to be used in commercial settings. However, psychological changes occurring throughout the human lifespan have been overlooked in the field of \"deep aging clocks\". In this paper, we present two deep learning predictors trained on social and behavioral data from Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study: (a) PsychoAge, which predicts chronological age, and (b) SubjAge, which describes personal aging rate perception. Using 50 distinct features from the MIDUS dataset these models have achieved a mean absolute error of 6.7 years for chronological age and 7.3 years for subjective age. We also show that both PsychoAge and SubjAge are predictive of all-cause mortality risk, with SubjAge being a more significant risk factor. Both clocks contain actionable features that can be modified using social and behavioral interventions, which enables a variety of aging-related psychology experiment designs. The features used in these clocks are interpretable by human experts and may prove to be useful in shifting personal perception of aging towards a mindset that promotes productive and healthy behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Gleason grading is the standard diagnostic method for prostate cancer and is essential for determining prognosis and treatment. The dearth of expert pathologists, the inter- and intraobserver variability, as well as the labour intensity of Gleason grading all necessitate the development of a user-friendly tool for robust standardisation.\nTo develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, based on machine learning and convolutional neural networks, as a tool for improved standardisation in Gleason grading in prostate cancer biopsies.\nA total of 698 prostate biopsy sections from 174 patients were used for training. The training sections were annotated by two senior consultant pathologists. The final algorithm was tested on 37 biopsy sections from 21 patients, with digitised slide images from two different scanners.\nCorrelation, sensitivity, and specificity parameters were calculated.\nThe algorithm shows high accuracy in detecting cancer areas (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 68%). Compared with the pathologists, the algorithm also performed well in detecting cancer areas (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.99) and assigning the Gleason patterns correctly: Gleason patterns 3 and 4 (ICC: 0.96 and 0.94, respectively), and to a lesser extent, Gleason pattern 5 (ICC: 0.82). Similar results were obtained using two different scanners.\nOur AI-based algorithm can reliably detect prostate cancer and quantify the Gleason patterns in core needle biopsies, with similar accuracy as pathologists. The results are reproducible on images from different scanners with a proven low level of intraobserver variability. We believe that this AI tool could be regarded as an efficient and interactive tool for pathologists.\nWe developed a sensitive artificial intelligence tool for prostate biopsies, which detects and grades cancer with similar accuracy to pathologists. This tool holds promise to improve the diagnosis of prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "In this study, to address the problems of multiple dimensions, large scales, complex tension resource scheduling, and strict quality control requirements in the tensioning process of cables in prestressed steel structures, the technical characteristics of digital twins (DTs) and artificial intelligence (AI) are analyzed. An intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables method driven by the integration of DTs and AI is proposed. Based on the current research status of cable tensioning and DTs, combined with the goal of intelligent tensioning, a fusion mechanism for DTs and AI is established and their integration to drive intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables technology is analyzed. In addition, the key issues involved in the construction of an intelligent control center driven by the integration of DTs and AI are discussed. By considering the construction elements of space and time dimensions, the tensioning process is controlled at multiple levels, thereby realizing the intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables. Driven by intelligent tensioning methods, the safety performance evaluation of the intelligent tensioning process is analyzed. Combined with sensing equipment and intelligent algorithms, a high-fidelity twin model and three-dimensional integrated data model are constructed to realize closed-loop control of the intelligent tensioning safety evaluation. Through the study of digital twins and artificial intelligence fusion to drive the intelligent tensioning method for prestressed cables, this study focuses on the analysis of the intelligent evaluation of safety performance. This study provides a reference for fusion applications with DTs and AI in intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19, which is accompanied by acute respiratory distress, multiple organ failure, and death, has spread worldwide much faster than previously thought. However, at present, it has limited treatments.\nTo overcome this issue, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model of COVID-19, named EDRnet (ensemble learning model based on deep neural network and random forest models), to predict in-hospital mortality using a routine blood sample at the time of hospital admission.\nWe selected 28 blood biomarkers and used the age and gender information of patients as model inputs. To improve the mortality prediction, we adopted an ensemble approach combining deep neural network and random forest models. We trained our model with a database of blood samples from 361 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, and applied it to 106 COVID-19 patients in three Korean medical institutions.\nIn the testing data sets, EDRnet provided high sensitivity (100%), specificity (91%), and accuracy (92%). To extend the number of patient data points, we developed a web application (BeatCOVID19) where anyone can access the model to predict mortality and can register his or her own blood laboratory results.\nOur new AI model, EDRnet, accurately predicts the mortality rate for COVID-19. It is publicly available and aims to help health care providers fight COVID-19 and improve patients' outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on key areas in which artificial intelligence has affected the chess world, including cheat detection methods, which are especially necessary recently, as there has been an unexpected rise in the popularity of online chess. Many major chess events that were to take place in 2020 have been canceled, but the global popularity of chess has in fact grown in recent months due to easier conversion of the game from offline to online formats compared with other games. Still, though a game of chess can be easily played online, there are some concerns about the increased chances of cheating. Artificial intelligence can address these concerns.",

    "abstract": "To elucidate the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in therapeutics for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Five databases were searched (December 2019-May 2020). We included both published and pre-print original articles in English that applied AI, machine learning or deep learning in drug repurposing, novel drug discovery, vaccine and antibody development for COVID-19. Out of 31 studies included, 16 studies applied AI for drug repurposing, whereas 10 studies utilized AI for novel drug discovery. Only four studies used AI technology for vaccine development, whereas one study generated stable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Approx. 50% of studies exclusively targeted 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2, and only two studies targeted ACE/TMPSS2 for inhibiting host viral interactions. Around 16% of the identified drugs are in different phases of clinical evaluation against COVID-19. AI has emerged as a promising solution of COVID-19 therapeutics. During this current pandemic, many of the researchers have used AI-based strategies to process large databases in a more customized manner leading to the faster identification of several potential targets, novel/repurposing of drugs and vaccine candidates. A number of these drugs are either approved or are in a late-stage clinical trial and are potentially effective against SARS-CoV2 indicating validity of the methodology. However, as the use of AI-based screening program is currently in budding stage, sole reliance on such algorithms is not advisable at this current point of time and an evidence based approach is warranted to confirm their usefulness against this life-threatening disease.

    "abstract": "Perioperative medicine is a patient-centered, multidisciplinary and integrated clinical practice that starts from the moment of contemplation of surgery until full recovery. Every perioperative phase (preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative) must be studied and planned in order to optimize the entire patient management. Perioperative optimization does not only concern a short-term outcome improvement, but it has also a strong impact on long term survival. Clinical cases variability leads to the collection and analysis of a huge amount of different data, coming from multiple sources, making perioperative management standardization very difficult. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play a primary role in this challenge, helping human mind in perioperative practice planning and decision-making process. AI refers to the ability of a computer system to perform functions and reasoning typical of the human mind; Machine Learning (ML) could play a fundamental role in presurgical planning, during intraoperative phase and postoperative management. Perioperative medicine is the cornerstone of surgical patient management and the tools deriving from the application of AI seem very promising as a support in optimizing the management of each individual patient. Despite the increasing help that will derive from the use of AI tools, the uniqueness of the patient and the particularity of each individual clinical case will always keep the role of the human mind central in clinical and perioperative management. The role of the physician, who must analyze the outputs provided by AI by following his own experience and knowledge, remains and will always be essential.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have the potential to improve multiple facets of medical practice, including diagnosis of disease, surgical training, clinical outcomes, and access to healthcare. There have been various applications of this technology to surgical fields. AI and ML have been used to evaluate a surgeon's technical skill. These technologies can detect instrument motion, recognize patterns in video recordings, and track the physical motion, eye movements, and cognitive function of the surgeon. These modalities also aid in the advancement of robotic surgical training. The da Vinci Standard Surgical System developed a recording and playback system to help trainees receive tactical feedback to acquire more precision when operating. ML has shown promise in recognizing and classifying complex patterns on diagnostic images and within pathologic tissue analysis. This allows for more accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment. Artificial neural networks are able to analyze sets of symptoms in conjunction with labs, imaging, and exam findings to determine the likelihood of a diagnosis or outcome. Telemedicine is another use of ML and AI that uses technology such as voice recognition to deliver health care remotely. Limitations include the need for large data sets to program computers to create the algorithms. There is also the potential for misclassification of data points that do not follow the typical patterns learned by the machine. As more applications of AI and ML are developed for the surgical field, further studies are needed to determine feasibility, efficacy, and cost.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant metabolism is the root cause of several serious health issues, creating a huge burden to health and leading to diminished life expectancy. A dysregulated metabolism induces the secretion of several molecules which in turn trigger the inflammatory pathway. Inflammation is the natural reaction of the immune system to a variety of stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, and harmful substances. Metabolically triggered inflammation, also called metaflammation or low-grade chronic inflammation, is the consequence of a synergic interaction between the host and the exposome-a combination of environmental drivers, including diet, lifestyle, pollutants and other factors throughout the life span of an individual. Various levels of chronic inflammation are associated with several lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes, obesity, metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), cancers, cardiovascular disorders (CVDs), autoimmune diseases, and chronic lung diseases. Chronic diseases are a growing concern worldwide, placing a heavy burden on individuals, families, governments, and health-care systems. New strategies are needed to empower communities worldwide to prevent and treat these diseases. Precision medicine provides a model for the next generation of lifestyle modification. This will capitalize on the dynamic interaction between an individual's biology, lifestyle, behavior, and environment. The aim of precision medicine is to design and improve diagnosis, therapeutics and prognostication through the use of large complex datasets that incorporate individual gene, function, and environmental variations. The implementation of high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) can predict risks with greater accuracy based on available multidimensional clinical and biological datasets. AI-powered precision medicine provides clinicians with an opportunity to specifically tailor early interventions to each individual. In this article, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing and evolving recent, data-driven technologies, such as AI, in preventing, treating and reversing lifestyle-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) is thought to play a significant role in professional and academic success. EI is important for medical personnel\u00a0to cope with highly stressful circumstances during clinical and academic settings. The present prospective follow-up study intends to evaluate the changes in EI and their correlates among medical undergraduates over a five-year period.\nData were collected in 2015 and 2020 at the Faculty of Medicine, University of\u00a0Colombo, Sri Lanka. EI was assessed using the validated 33-item self-assessment tool, Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSEIT). In addition, socio-demographic details, students' involvement in extracurricular-activities during undergraduate life, students' satisfaction regarding the choice of studying medicine and plans to do postgraduate studies were also evaluated. A multiple-regression analysis was conducted among all students using percentage change in EI score as the continuous dependent variable, together with other independent variables (plan to do postgraduate studies, satisfaction in choice of medicine and extracurricular-activities).\nSample size was 170 (response rates-96.6%), with 41.2% males (n\u2009=\u200970). Mean EI scores at baseline among all students was 122.7\u2009\u00b1\u200911.6, and it had significantly increased at follow-up to 128.9\u2009\u00b1\u200911.2 (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.001). This significant increase was independently observed in both males (122.1\u2009\u00b1\u200912.2 vs. 130.0\u2009\u00b1\u200912.4, p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.001) and females (123.1\u2009\u00b1\u200911.1 vs. 128.2\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3, p\u2009=\u20090.001). During follow-up, an increase in EI score was observed in students of all religions and ethnicities. Mean EI score also increased in all categories of monthly income, irrespective of the employment status or attainment of higher education of either parent. An increase in mean EI score during follow-up was observed in students irrespective of their engagement in or number of extracurricular-activities, they were involved. In the multiple regression analysis, being satisfied regarding their choice of the medical undergraduate programme (OR:11.75, p\u2009=\u20090.001) was the only significant factor associated with the percentage change in EI score.\nEI in this group significantly improved over 5-years of follow-up and was independent of gender, religion, ethnicity, socio-economic parameters and academic performance. Satisfaction in the chosen field was a significant predictor of the overall change in EI. Future studies are\u00a0\u00a0needed to identify and measure factors responsible for improvement in EI among medical undergraduates.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in Canada, and accurate, early diagnosis are critical to improving clinical outcomes. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based imaging analytics are a promising healthcare innovation that aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer diagnosis. Maximizing their clinical potential while mitigating their risks and limitations will require focused leadership informed by interdisciplinary expertise and system-wide insight. We convened a knowledge exchange workshop with diverse Saskatchewan health system leaders and stakeholders to explore issues surrounding the use of AI in diagnostic imaging for lung cancer, including implementation opportunities, challenges, and priorities. This technology is anticipated to improve patient outcomes, reduce unnecessary healthcare spending, and increase knowledge. However, health system leaders must also address the needs for robust data, financial investment, effective communication and collaboration between healthcare sectors, privacy and data protections, and continued interdisciplinary research to achieve this technology's potential benefits.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies show that the family plays a crucial role not only in the education of children but also in the acquisition of skills in the process of teaching and formal learning, especially in their reading competence. Furthermore, within the family, studies point to the basic role of the mother as the main axis of both educational and social teaching. The approach of this research aims to analyze whether maternal habits can influence the reading competence of their children. On the other hand, numerous studies point to the relationship between reading skills and emotional intelligence. Its inclusion in the equation of this construct can give information that will nuance the learning process in this evolutionary process. Thus, in this research, the objective is to establish the existence of a relationship between maternal reading habits with respect to reading competence and emotional intelligence in post-adolescents. Four-hundred-twenty first-year university students participated between the ages of 18 and 20 (43.8% men and 56.2% women) from the Andalusian universities of Granada, Malaga, and Jaen, all of them located in areas of medium socio-cultural context. Moderate mediation and factorial ANCOVA analyses have been carried out. The results point to the fact that the profile of the post-adolescents with the best score in reading competence also scores better in emotional intelligence and their mothers are those who score highest in reading habits. Thus, the role of the mother within the family is even more important than it appears in a society that seeks parity. New forms of work-family conciliation are necessary in order not to break the mother-child bond.",

    "abstract": "Although heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a rapidly emerging global health problem, an adequate tool to screen it reliably and economically does not exist. We developed an interpretable deep learning model (DLM) using electrocardiography (ECG) and validated its performance.\nThis retrospective cohort study included two hospitals. 34 103 patients who underwent echocardiography and ECG within 1 week and indicated normal left ventricular systolic function were included in this study. A DLM based on an ensemble neural network was developed using 32 671 ECGs of 20 169 patients. The internal validation included 1979 ECGs of 1979 patients. Furthermore, we conducted an external validation with 11 955 ECGs of 11 955 patients from another hospital. The endpoint was to detect HFpEF. During the internal and external validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of a DLM using 12-lead ECG for detecting HFpEF were 0.866 (95% confidence interval 0.850-0.883) and 0.869 (0.860-0.877), respectively. In the 1412 individuals without HFpEF at initial echocardiography, patients whose DLM was defined as having a higher risk had a significantly higher chance of developing HFpEF than those in the low-risk group (33.6% vs. 8.4%, \nThe DLM demonstrated high performance for HFpEF detection using not only a 12-lead ECG but also 6- single-lead ECG. These results suggest that HFpEF can be screened using conventional ECG devices and diverse life-type ECG machines employing the DLM, thereby preventing disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Screening for prostate cancer relies on the serum prostate-specific antigen test, which provides a high rate of false positives (80%). This results in a large number of unnecessary biopsies and subsequent overtreatment. Considering the frequency of the test, there is a critical unmet need of precision screening for prostate cancer. Here, we introduced a urinary multimarker biosensor with a capacity to learn to achieve this goal. The correlation of clinical state with the sensing signals from urinary multimarkers was analyzed by two common machine learning algorithms. As the number of biomarkers was increased, both algorithms provided a monotonic increase in screening performance. Under the best combination of biomarkers, the machine learning algorithms screened prostate cancer patients with more than 99% accuracy using 76 urine specimens. Urinary multimarker biosensor leveraged by machine learning analysis can be an important strategy of precision screening for cancers using a drop of bodily fluid.",

    "abstract": "There has been a recent explosion of research into the field of artificial intelligence as applied to clinical radiology with the advent of highly accurate computer vision technology. These studies, however, vary significantly in design and quality. While recent guidelines have been established to advise on ethics, data management and the potential directions of future research, systematic reviews of the entire field are lacking. We aim to investigate the use of artificial intelligence as applied to radiology, to identify the clinical questions being asked, which methodological approaches are applied to these questions and trends in use over time.\nWe will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. We will perform a literature search through MEDLINE (Pubmed), and EMBASE, a detailed data extraction of trial characteristics and a narrative synthesis of the data. There will be no language restrictions. We will take a task-centred approach rather than focusing on modality or clinical subspecialty. Sub-group analysis will be performed by segmentation tasks, identification tasks, classification tasks, pegression/prediction tasks as well as a sub-analysis for paediatric patients.\nEthical approval will not be required for this study, as data will be obtained from publicly available clinical trials. We will disseminate our results in a peer-reviewed publication. Registration number PROSPERO: CRD42020154790.",

    "abstract": "Neurological disorders significantly outnumber diseases in other therapeutic areas. However, developing drugs for central nervous system (CNS) disorders remains the most challenging area in drug discovery, accompanied with the long timelines and high attrition rates. With the rapid growth of biomedical data enabled by advanced experimental technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as an indispensable tool to draw meaningful insights and improve decision making in drug discovery. Thanks to the advancements in AI and ML algorithms, now the AI/ML-driven solutions have an unprecedented potential to accelerate the process of CNS drug discovery with better success rate. In this review, we comprehensively summarize AI/ML-powered pharmaceutical discovery efforts and their implementations in the CNS area. After introducing the AI/ML models as well as the conceptualization and data preparation, we outline the applications of AI/ML technologies to several key procedures in drug discovery, including target identification, compound screening, hit/lead generation and optimization, drug response and synergy prediction, de novo drug design, and drug repurposing. We review the current state-of-the-art of AI/ML-guided CNS drug discovery, focusing on blood-brain barrier permeability prediction and implementation into therapeutic discovery for neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss the major challenges and limitations of current approaches and possible future directions that may provide resolutions to these difficulties.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis remains an urgent issue on the urban health agenda, especially in low- and middle-income countries. There is a need to develop and implement innovative and effective solutions in the tuberculosis diagnostic process. In this article, We describe the importance of artificial intelligence as a strategy to address tuberculosis control, particularly by providing timely diagnosis. Besides technological factors, the role of socio-technical, cultural and organizational factors is emphasized. The eRx tool involving deep learning algorithms and specifically the use of convolutional neural networks is presented as a case study. eRx is a promising artificial intelligence-based tool for the diagnosis of tuberculosis; which comprises a variety of innovative techniques involving remote X-ray analysis for suspected tuberculosis cases. Innovations based on artificial intelligence tools can optimize the diagnostic process for tuberculosis and other communicable diseases.\nLa tuberculosis sigue siendo un tema urgente en la agenda de la salud urbana, especialmente en pa\u00edses de medianos y bajos ingresos. Existe la necesidad de desarrollar e implementar soluciones innovadoras y efectivas en el proceso de diagn\u00f3stico de la tuberculosis. En este art\u00edculo, se describe la importancia de la inteligencia artificial como una estrategia para enfrentar la tuberculosis, mediante un diagn\u00f3stico oportuno. Adem\u00e1s de los factores tecnol\u00f3gicos, se enfatiza el rol de los factores sociot\u00e9cnicos, culturales y organizacionales. Se presenta como caso la herramienta eRx que involucra algoritmos de aprendizaje profundo y, en espec\u00edfico, el uso de redes neuronales convolucionales. eRx es una herramienta prometedora basada en inteligencia artificial para el diagn\u00f3stico de tuberculosis que comprende una variedad de t\u00e9cnicas innovadoras que implican el an\u00e1lisis remoto de rayos\u00a0X para casos sospechosos de tuberculosis. Las innovaciones basadas en herramientas de inteligencia artificial pueden optimizar el proceso de diagn\u00f3stico de la tuberculosis y de otras enfermedades transmisibles.",

    "abstract": "Trait Emotional Intelligence (EI) has been associated with psychological outcomes in many conditions; however, it has received little attention in the field of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). We explored the relationship between trait EI, mood states, and future orientation in a sample of Italian women victims of IPV.\nWe recruited 409 help-seeking women who were victims of IPV. They completed the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire, Positive Affect-Negative Affect Schedule, Long-Term Personal Direction Scale, and Achievability of Future Goals Scale.\nThe results showed that trait EI was associated with the future orientation of IPV victims both directly and indirectly through the mood states.\nOur findings suggest potential paths for developing future psychoeducation methodologies designed at improving the quality of life of women IPV victims.",

    "abstract": "Undergraduate student, especially first-year students face challenges in the new found academic environment. Critical thinking (CT) has been found to be effective in managing negative experiences. Earlier literature found Emotional intelligence (EI) is accounted for variance in critical thinking (CT) skill irrespective of the gender. However, there is scarcity of research on the relationship between EI and CT disposition with respect to gender. The present research intended to study the effect of EI on CT disposition of students in the transition phase with gender as a moderator. 500 first-year undergraduate students from West Bengal (eastern part of India) were selected to fill up assessment tools; the Profile of Emotional Competence (Brasseur et al., 2013) and Critical Thinking Disposition Assessment (Ricketts & Rudd, 2005). Structural Equation Model (SEM) was followed using AMOS adopting maximum likelihood approach. Path analysis revealed an accepted model fit establishing EI to have significant effect on CT disposition. However, this effect was not moderated by gender. The present research might be helpful in generating awareness regarding the importance of EI and training for developing disposition of CT among college fresher's well-being and emotional health. The study has highlighted the non-significant moderating role of gender in relation to EI and CT disposition that was missing in the existing literature.",

    "abstract": "The digitalization of health and medicine and the growing availability of electronic health records (EHRs) has encouraged healthcare professionals and clinical researchers to adopt cutting-edge methodologies in the realms of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics to exploit existing large medical databases. In Hospital and Health System pharmacies, the application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to access and analyze the unstructured, free-text information captured in millions of EHRs (e.g., medication safety, patients' medication history, adverse drug reactions, interactions, medication errors, therapeutic outcomes, and pharmacokinetic consultations) may become an essential tool to improve patient care and perform real-time evaluations of the efficacy, safety, and comparative effectiveness of available drugs. This approach has an enormous potential to support share-risk agreements and guide decision-making in pharmacy and therapeutics (P&T) Committees.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to determine whether artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted markerless motion capture software is useful in the clinical medicine and rehabilitation fields. Currently, it is unclear whether the AI-assisted markerless method can be applied to individuals with lower limb dysfunction, such as those using an ankle foot orthosis or a crutch. However, as many patients with lower limb paralysis and foot orthosis users lose metatarsophalangeal (MP) joint flexion during the stance phase, it is necessary to estimate the accuracy of foot recognition under fixed MP joint motion. The hip, knee, and ankle joint angles during treadmill walking were determined using OpenPose (a markerless method) and the conventional passive marker motion capture method; the results from both methods were compared. We also examined whether an ankle foot orthosis and a crutch could influence the recognition ability of OpenPose. The hip and knee joint data obtained by the passive marker method (MAC3D), OpenPose, and manual video analysis using Kinovea software showed significant correlation. Compared with the ankle joint data obtained by OpenPose and Kinovea, which were strongly correlated, those obtained by MAC3D presented a weaker correlation. OpenPose can be an adequate substitute for conventional passive marker motion capture for both normal gait and abnormal gait with an orthosis or a crutch. Furthermore, OpenPose is applicable to patients with impaired MP joint motion. The use of OpenPose can reduce the complexity and cost associated with conventional passive marker motion capture without compromising recognition accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Understanding workforce pressures within surgery is an inexact science. This paper assembles evidence regarding oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) consultant appointments in the UK and plans for prospective data collection in the future. Information about the number of OMFS specialists joining the UK specialist list was obtained from the General Medical Council and compared to a database of substantive OMFS consultant posts. OMFS consultants were asked to contribute information about their training programmes and consultant appointments (date, interview experience, and sub-specialty interest). This information was collated on Excel\u00a9 and analysed using WinStat\u00a9. Data on OMFS consultant posts advertised in 'NHS Jobs' and the British Medical Journal were collected. The mean (SD) number of specialists joining the specialist list per year is 24.1 (5.2) with a median of 24 and a range of 15 - 36. The number of trainees completing training and numbers joining the OMFS specialist list are in balance at present. The median delay between OMFS specialist listing and appointment as a consultant was 72 days and mean of 169 with the 25th centile of five days, standard deviation of 239 days and maximum of 5.2 years. Of those returning data, 135 (47%) candidates were the sole interviewee and 83 (29%) had one other candidate at their successful interview. The mean application ratio for each post was 1.9 and the median number of candidates was one, mean 1.6 and maximum candidates seven. About half of the posts were filled by trainees from their regional training rotation. Prospective data collection on advertised posts, interviews held, expected retirements/new posts, combined with a route for trainees approaching CCT to highlight their availability may streamline recruitment and allow a more rapid recognition of recruitment problems.",

    "abstract": "In Tg-rasH2 carcinogenicity mouse models, a positive control group is treated with a carcinogen such as urethane or N-nitroso-N-methylurea to test study validity based on the presence of the expected proliferative lesions in the transgenic mice. We hypothesized that artificial intelligence-based deep learning (DL) could provide decision support for the toxicologic pathologist by screening for the proliferative changes, verifying the expected pattern for the positive control groups. Whole slide images (WSIs) of the lungs, thymus, and stomach from positive control groups were used for supervised training of a convolutional neural network (CNN). A single pathologist annotated WSIs of normal and abnormal tissue regions for training the CNN-based supervised classifier using INHAND criteria. The algorithm was evaluated using a subset of tissue regions that were not used for training and then additional tissues were evaluated blindly by 2 independent pathologists. A binary output (proliferative classes present or not) from the pathologists was compared to that of the CNN classifier. The CNN model grouped proliferative lesion positive and negative animals at high concordance with the pathologists. This process simulated a workflow for review of these studies, whereby a DL algorithm could provide decision support for the pathologists in a nonclinical study.",

    "abstract": "Rodent progressive cardiomyopathy (PCM) encompasses a constellation of microscopic findings commonly seen as a spontaneous background change in rat and mouse hearts. Primary histologic features of PCM include varying degrees of cardiomyocyte degeneration/necrosis, mononuclear cell infiltration, and fibrosis. Mineralization can also occur. Cardiotoxicity may increase the incidence and severity of PCM, and toxicity-related morphologic changes can overlap with those of PCM. Consequently, sensitive and consistent detection and quantification of PCM features are needed to help differentiate spontaneous from test article-related findings. To address this, we developed a computer-assisted image analysis algorithm, facilitated by a fully convolutional network deep learning technique, to detect and quantify the microscopic features of PCM (degeneration/necrosis, fibrosis, mononuclear cell infiltration, mineralization) in rat heart histologic sections. The trained algorithm achieved high values for accuracy, intersection over union, and dice coefficient for each feature. Further, there was a strong positive correlation between the percentage area of the heart predicted to have PCM lesions by the algorithm and the median severity grade assigned by a panel of veterinary toxicologic pathologists following light microscopic evaluation. By providing objective and sensitive quantification of the microscopic features of PCM, deep learning algorithms could assist pathologists in discerning cardiotoxicity-associated changes.",

These two tasks belong to the key issues related to the management and operation of water supply networks, apart from the reduction in water losses caused by network failures and ensuring proper water quality.

    "abstract": "Credit scoring is an important tool used by financial institutions to correctly identify defaulters and non-defaulters. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are the Artificial Intelligence techniques that have been attracting interest due to their flexibility to account for various data patterns. Both are black-box models which are sensitive to hyperparameter settings. Feature selection can be performed on SVM to enable explanation with the reduced features, whereas feature importance computed by RF can be used for model explanation. The benefits of accuracy and interpretation allow for significant improvement in the area of credit risk and credit scoring. This paper proposes the use of Harmony Search (HS), to form a hybrid HS-SVM to perform feature selection and hyperparameter tuning simultaneously, and a hybrid HS-RF to tune the hyperparameters. A Modified HS (MHS) is also proposed with the main objective to achieve comparable results as the standard HS with a shorter computational time. MHS consists of four main modifications in the standard HS: (i) Elitism selection during memory consideration instead of random selection, (ii) dynamic exploration and exploitation operators in place of the original static operators, (iii) a self-adjusted bandwidth operator, and (iv) inclusion of additional termination criteria to reach faster convergence. Along with parallel computing, MHS effectively reduces the computational time of the proposed hybrid models. The proposed hybrid models are compared with standard statistical models across three different datasets commonly used in credit scoring studies. The computational results show that MHS-RF is most robust in terms of model performance, model explainability and computational time.",

    "abstract": "Visually impaired people face numerous difficulties in their daily life, and technological interventions may assist them to meet these challenges. This paper proposes an artificial intelligence-based fully automatic assistive technology to recognize different objects, and auditory inputs are provided to the user in real time, which gives better understanding to the visually impaired person about their surroundings. A deep-learning model is trained with multiple images of objects that are highly relevant to the visually impaired person. Training images are augmented and manually annotated to bring more robustness to the trained model. In addition to computer vision-based techniques for object recognition, a distance-measuring sensor is integrated to make the device more comprehensive by recognizing obstacles while navigating from one place to another. The auditory information that is conveyed to the user after scene segmentation and obstacle identification is optimized to obtain more information in less time for faster processing of video frames. The average accuracy of this proposed method is 95.19% and 99.69% for object detection and recognition, respectively. The time complexity is low, allowing a user to perceive the surrounding scene in real time.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes and compares the sensitivity and suitability of several artificial intelligence techniques applied to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system for the classification of stars. The MK system is based on a sequence of spectral prototypes that allows classifying stars according to their effective temperature and luminosity through the study of their optical stellar spectra. Here, we include the method description and the results achieved by the different intelligent models developed thus far in our ongoing stellar classification project: fuzzy knowledge-based systems, backpropagation, radial basis function (RBF) and Kohonen artificial neural networks. Since one of today's major challenges in this area of astrophysics is the exploitation of large terrestrial and space databases, we propose a final hybrid system that integrates the best intelligent techniques, automatically collects the most important spectral features, and determines the spectral type and luminosity level of the stars according to the MK standard system. This hybrid approach truly emulates the behavior of human experts in this area, resulting in higher success rates than any of the individual implemented techniques. In the final classification system, the most suitable methods are selected for each individual spectrum, which implies a remarkable contribution to the automatic classification process.",

    "abstract": "Conjugate gaze deviation is associated with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), although previously only measured on a 2D plane. The current study evaluates 3D imaging efficacy to assess conjugate gaze deviation and correlate direction and strength of deviation to neuro-clinical findings.A retrospective analysis of 519 patients who had CT scans for suspected AIS at our institution. Direction and angle of eye deviation were calculated based on 2D axial images. Volumetric reconstruction of CT scans allowed for calculation of 3D conjugate gaze adjusted length (CGAL). Angle, direction, and vector strength of both 2D and 3D scans were calculated by an artificial intelligence algorithm and tested for agreement with hemispheric ischemia location. CGAL measurements were correlated to NIHSS scores. Follow up MRI data was used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of CGAL in the identification of AIS.The final analysis included 122 patients. A strong agreement was found between 3D gaze direction and hemispheric ischemia location. CGAL measurements were highly correlated with NIHSS score (r\u200a=\u200a.72, P\u200a=\u200a.01). A CGAL >0.25, >0.28, and >0.35 exhibited a sensitivity of 91%, 86%, and 82% and specificity of 66%, 89%, and 89%, respectively, in AIS identification. A CGAL >0.28 has the best sensitivity-specificity balance in the identification of AIS. A CGAL >0.25 has the highest sensitivity.Given CED's correlation with NIHSS score a 1/4 deviation in the ipsilateral direction is a sensitive ancillary radiographic sign to assist radiologists in making a correct diagnosis even when not presented with full clinical data.",

    "abstract": "In December 2019, COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan, China, leading to national and international disruptions in health care, business, education, transportation, and nearly every aspect of our daily lives. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been leveraged amid the COVID-19 pandemic; however, little is known about its use for supporting public health efforts.\nThis scoping review aims to explore how AI technology is being used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported in the literature. Thus, it is the first review that describes and summarizes features of the identified AI techniques and data sets used for their development and validation.\nA scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). We searched the most commonly used electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo) between April 10 and 12, 2020. These terms were selected based on the target intervention (ie, AI) and the target disease (ie, COVID-19). Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the extracted data.\nWe considered 82 studies out of the 435 retrieved studies. The most common use of AI was diagnosing COVID-19 cases based on various indicators. AI was also employed in drug and vaccine discovery or repurposing and for assessing their safety. Further, the included studies used AI for forecasting the epidemic development of COVID-19 and predicting its potential hosts and reservoirs. Researchers used AI for patient outcome-related tasks such as assessing the severity of COVID-19, predicting mortality risk, its associated factors, and the length of hospital stay. AI was used for infodemiology to raise awareness to use water, sanitation, and hygiene. The most prominent AI technique used was convolutional neural network, followed by support vector machine.\nThe included studies showed that AI has the potential to fight against COVID-19. However, many of the proposed methods are not yet clinically accepted. Thus, the most rewarding research will be on methods promising value beyond COVID-19. More efforts are needed for developing standardized reporting protocols or guidelines for studies on AI.",

AI was also employed in drug and vaccine discovery or repurposing and for assessing their safety. Further, the included studies used AI for forecasting the epidemic development of COVID-19 and predicting its potential hosts and reservoirs. Researchers used AI for patient outcome-related tasks such as assessing the severity of COVID-19, predicting mortality risk, its associated factors, and the length of hospital stay. AI was used for infodemiology to raise awareness to use water, sanitation, and hygiene. The most prominent AI technique used was convolutional neural network, followed by support vector machine.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The primary purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and the effectiveness of Starkey Livio Artificial Intelligence hearing aids in tracking step count. A secondary purpose was to investigate the accuracy of the fall detection and alert system of Livio hearing aids in detecting fall maneuvers. Method A participant wore Binaural Starkey Livio receiver-in-the-canal style hearing aids, a Sportline pedometer, and a Fitbit Charge 3 concurrently during both real-world and treadmill walking conditions. The real-world condition was conducted over a 5-day period. Step count for the treadmill protocol was assessed at six different treadmill speeds (2 mph, 2.5 mph, 3 mph, 3.5 mph, 4 mph, 4.5 mph, and 5 mph). The fall detection and alert system were assessed through falling maneuvers of activities of daily living. Results In the real-world condition, Livio, Sportline, and Fitbit recorded steps within 1 ",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related death world-wide despite advances in treatment. This largely relates to the fact that many of these patients already have advanced diseases at the time of initial diagnosis. As most lung cancers present as nodules initially, an accurate classification of pulmonary nodules as early lung cancers is critical to reducing lung cancer morbidity and mortality. There have been significant recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for lung nodule evaluation. Deep learning (DL) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in pulmonary nodule detection and have also excelled in segmentation and classification of pulmonary nodules. This review aims to provide an overview of progress that has been made in AI recently for pulmonary nodule detection and characterization with the ultimate goal of lung cancer prediction and classification while outlining some of the pitfalls and challenges that remain to bring such advancements to routine clinical use.",

    "abstract": "The surgical management of complications surrounding patients who have undergone hip arthroplasty necessitates accurate identification of the femoral implant manufacturer and model. Failure to do so risks delays in care, increased morbidity, and further economic burden. Because few arthroplasty experts can confidently classify implants using plain radiographs, automated image processing using deep learning for implant identification may offer an opportunity to improve the value of care rendered.\nWe trained, validated, and externally tested a deep-learning system to classify total hip arthroplasty and hip resurfacing arthroplasty femoral implants as one of 18 different manufacturer models from 1972 retrospectively collected anterior-posterior (AP) plain radiographs from 4 sites in one quaternary referral health system. From these radiographs, 1559 were used for training, 207 for validation, and 206 for external testing. Performance was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, as compared with a reference standard of implant model from operative reports with implant serial numbers.\nThe training and validation data sets from 1715 patients and 1766 AP radiographs included 18 different femoral components across four leading implant manufacturers and 10 fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeons. After 1000 training epochs by the deep-learning system, the system discriminated 18 implant models with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.999, accuracy of 99.6%, sensitivity of 94.3%, and specificity of 99.8% in the external-testing data set of 206 AP radiographs.\nA deep-learning system using AP plain radiographs accurately differentiated among 18 hip arthroplasty models from four industry leading manufacturers.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence model based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the likelihood of achieving a live birth using the proteomic profile of spent culture media and blastocyst morphology.\nThis retrospective cohort study included 212 patients who underwent single blastocyst transfer at IVI Valencia. A single image of each of 186 embryos was studied, and the protein profile was analysed in 81 samples of spent embryo culture medium from patients included in the preimplantation genetic testing programme. The information extracted from the analyses was used as input data for the ANN. The multilayer perceptron and the back-propagation learning method were used to train the ANN. Finally, predictive power was measured using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve.\nThree ANN architectures classified most of the embryos correctly as leading (LB+) or not leading (LB-) to a live birth: 100.0% for ANN1 (morphological variables and two proteins), 85.7% for ANN2 (morphological variables and seven proteins), and 83.3% for ANN3 (morphological variables and 25 proteins). The artificial intelligence model using information extracted from blastocyst image analysis and concentrations of interleukin-6 and matrix metalloproteinase-1 was able to predict live birth with an AUC of 1.0.\nThe model proposed in this preliminary report may provide a promising tool to select the embryo most likely to lead to a live birth in a euploid cohort. The accuracy of prediction demonstrated by this software may improve the efficacy of an assisted reproduction treatment by reducing the number of transfers per patient. Prospective studies are, however, needed.",

    "abstract": "While digital psychiatric interventions reduce treatment barriers, not all persons benefit from this type of treatment. Research is needed to preemptively identify who is likely to benefit from these digital treatments in order to redirect those people to a higher level of care. The current manuscript used an ensemble of machine learning methods to predict changes in major depressive and generalized anxiety disorder symptoms from pre to 9-month follow-up in a randomized controlled trial of a transdiagnostic digital intervention based on participants' (N=632) pre-treatment data. The results suggested that baseline characteristics could accurately predict changes in depressive symptoms in both treatment groups (r=0.482, 95% CI[0.394, 0.561]; r=0.477, 95% CI[0.385, 0.560]) and anxiety symptoms in both treatment groups (r=0.569, 95% CI[0.491, 0.638]; r=0.548, 95% CI[0.464, 0.622]). These results suggest that machine learning models are capable of preemptively predicting a person's responsiveness to digital treatments, which would enable personalized decision-making about which persons should be directed towards standalone digital interventions or towards blended stepped-care.",

    "abstract": "Internet is essential part of everyday life and certainly facilitate it on several levels. It is a helpful information tool, and knowledge, but its unlimited range often is risky for users. The behaviors and outcomes of internet abuse have already been well-documented in the literature; less is known about the role of personal factors that reinforce internet addiction. Based on the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution model (I-PACE), the current study investigates the role of trait emotional intelligence and self-esteem, age, and gender in relation to addictive internet behaviors. We conducted an online investigation among respondents. The participants were Italian university students who voluntarily completed the Abuse Internet Addiction scale (UADI) and the Rosenberg Self-esteem scale. Path analysis results revealed that both trait emotional intelligence and self-esteem had a protective direct effect on addictive internet behaviors. Age negatively affects addictive internet behaviors; younger are more likely to develop addictive internet behaviors than older individuals. Finally, we did not find an effect of gender on addictive internet behaviors. Our results suggest the need to develop prevention plans for addictive internet behaviors and educational programs to increase emotional intelligence and self-esteem components to help younger to improve interpersonal and emotional management skills to better handle their internet use.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) learning models can be created to predict drug structures that can be used to treat COVID-19. Despite the effectively demonstrated repurposed drugs, more repurposed drugs should be recognized. Furthermore, technological advancements have been helpful in the battle against COVID-19. Machine intelligence technology can support this procedure by rapidly determining adequate and effective drugs against COVID-19 and by overcoming any barrier between a large number of repurposed drugs, laboratory/clinical testing, and final drug authorization.

    "abstract": "Consumer-oriented mobile self-diagnosis apps have been developed using undisclosed algorithms, presumably based on machine learning and other artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US Food and Drug Administration now discerns apps with learning AI algorithms from those with stable ones and treats the former as medical devices. To the author's knowledge, no self-diagnosis app testing has been performed in the field of ophthalmology so far.\nThe objective of this study was to test apps that were previously mentioned in the scientific literature on a set of diagnoses in a deliberate time interval, comparing the results and looking for differences that hint at \"nonlocked\" learning algorithms.\nFour apps from the literature were chosen (Ada, Babylon, Buoy, and Your.MD). A set of three ophthalmology diagnoses (glaucoma, retinal tear, dry eye syndrome) representing three levels of urgency was used to simultaneously test the apps' diagnostic efficiency and treatment recommendations in this specialty. Two years was the chosen time interval between the tests (2018 and 2020). Scores were awarded by one evaluating physician using a defined scheme.\nTwo apps (Ada and Your.MD) received significantly higher scores than the other two. All apps either worsened in their results between 2018 and 2020 or remained unchanged at a low level. The variation in the results over time indicates \"nonlocked\" learning algorithms using AI technologies. None of the apps provided correct diagnoses and treatment recommendations for all three diagnoses in 2020. Two apps (Babylon and Your.MD) asked significantly fewer questions than the other two (P<.001).\n\"Nonlocked\" algorithms are used by self-diagnosis apps. The diagnostic efficiency of the tested apps seems to worsen over time, with some apps being more capable than others. Systematic studies on a wider scale are necessary for health care providers and patients to correctly assess the safety and efficacy of such apps and for correct classification by health care regulating authorities.",

    "abstract": "The immunization uptake rates in Pakistan are much lower than desired. Major reasons include lack of awareness, parental forgetfulness regarding schedules, and misinformation regarding vaccines. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and distancing measures, routine childhood immunization (RCI) coverage has been adversely affected, as caregivers avoid tertiary care hospitals or primary health centers. Innovative and cost-effective measures must be taken to understand and deal with the issue of low immunization rates. However, only a few smartphone-based interventions have been carried out in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to improve RCI.\nThe primary objectives of this study are to evaluate whether a personalized mobile app can improve children's on-time visits at 10 and 14 weeks of age for RCI as compared with standard care and to determine whether an artificial intelligence model can be incorporated into the app. Secondary objectives are to determine the perceptions and attitudes of caregivers regarding childhood vaccinations and to understand the factors that might influence the effect of a mobile phone-based app on vaccination improvement.\nA mixed methods randomized controlled trial was designed with intervention and control arms. The study will be conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital vaccination center. Caregivers of newborns or infants visiting the center for their children's 6-week vaccination will be recruited. The intervention arm will have access to a smartphone app with text, voice, video, and pictorial messages regarding RCI. This app will be developed based on the findings of the pretrial qualitative component of the study, in addition to no-show study findings, which will explore caregivers' perceptions about RCI and a mobile phone-based app in improving RCI coverage.\nPretrial qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted in February 2020. Enrollment of study participants for the randomized controlled trial is in process. Study exit interviews will be conducted at the 14-week immunization visits, provided the caregivers visit the immunization facility at that time, or over the phone when the children are 18 weeks of age.\nThis study will generate useful insights into the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of an Android-based smartphone app for improving RCI in Pakistan and in LMICs.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04449107; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04449107.\nDERR1-10.2196/22996.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have attracted considerable ethical attention for good reasons. Although AI models might advance human welfare in unprecedented ways, progress will not occur without substantial risks. This article considers 3 such risks: system malfunctions, privacy protections, and consent to data repurposing. To meet these challenges, traditional risk managers will likely need to collaborate intensively with computer scientists, bioinformaticists, information technologists, and data privacy and security experts. This essay will speculate on the degree to which these AI risks might be embraced or dismissed by risk management. In any event, it seems that integration of AI models into health care operations will almost certainly introduce, if not new forms of risk, then a dramatically heightened magnitude of risk that will have to be managed.",

    "abstract": "Electronic health record (EHR) vendors now offer \"off-the-shelf\" artificial intelligence (AI) models to client organizations. Our health system faced difficulties in promoting end-user utilization of a new AI model for predicting readmissions embedded in the EHR.\nThe aim is to conduct a case study centered on identifying barriers to uptake/utilization.\nA qualitative study was conducted using interviews with stakeholders. The interviews were used to identify relevant stakeholders, understand current workflows, identify implementation barriers, and formulate future strategies.\nWe discovered substantial variation in existing workflows around readmissions. Some stakeholders did not perform any formal readmissions risk assessment. Others accustomed to using existing risk scores such as LACE+ had concerns about transitioning to a new model. Some stakeholders had existing workflows in place that could accommodate the new model, but they were not previously aware that the new model was in production. Concerns expressed by end-users included: whether the model's predictors were relevant to their work, need for adoption of additional workflow processes, need for training and change management, and potential for unintended consequences (e.g., increased health care resource utilization due to potentially over-referring discharged patients to home health services).\nAI models for risk stratification, even if \"off-the-shelf\" by design, are unlikely to be \"plug-and-play\" in health care settings. Seeking out key stakeholders and defining clear use cases early in the implementation process can better facilitate utilization of these models.",

    "abstract": "This study aims at analyzing the separability of acute cerebral infarction lesions which were invisible in CT. 38 patients, who were diagnosed with acute cerebral infarction and performed both CT and MRI, and 18 patients, who had no positive finding in either CT or MRI, were enrolled. Comparative studies were performed on lesion and symmetrical regions, normal brain and symmetrical regions, lesion, and normal brain regions. MRI was reconstructed and affine transformed to obtain accurate lesion position of CT. Radiomic features and information gain were introduced to capture efficient features. Finally, 10 classifiers were established with selected features to evaluate the effectiveness of analysis. 1301 radiomic features were extracted from candidate regions after registration. For lesion and their symmetrical regions, there were 280 features with information gain greater than 0.1 and 2 features with information gain greater than 0.3. The average classification accuracy was 0.6467, and the best classification accuracy was 0.7748. For normal brain and their symmetrical regions, there were 176 features with information gain greater than 0.1, 1 feature with information gain greater than 0.2. The average classification accuracy was 0.5414, and the best classification accuracy was 0.6782. For normal brain and lesions, there were 501 features with information gain greater than 0.1 and 1 feature with information gain greater than 0.5. The average classification accuracy was 0.7480, and the best classification accuracy was 0.8694. In conclusion, the study captured significant features correlated with acute cerebral infarction and confirmed the separability of acute lesions in CT, which established foundation for further artificial intelligence-assisted CT diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Observation of the entire stomach during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is important; however, there is a lack of effective evaluation tools.\nTo develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted EGD system able to automatically monitor blind spots in real-time.\nAn AI-based system, called the Intelligent Detection Endoscopic Assistant (IDEA), was developed using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The performance of IDEA for recognition of gastric sites in images and videos was evaluated. Primary outcomes included diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\nA total of 170,297 images and 5779 endoscopic videos were collected to develop the system. As the test group, 3100 EGD images were acquired to evaluate the performance of DCNN in recognition of gastric sites in images. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of DCNN were determined as 97.18%,99.91%, and 99.83%, respectively. To assess the performance of IDEA in recognition of gastric sites in EGD videos, 129 videos were used as the test group. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of IDEA were 96.29%,93.32%, and 95.30%, respectively.\nIDEA achieved high accuracy for recognition of gastric sites in real-time. The system can be applied as a powerful assistant tool for monitoring blind spots during EGD.",

    "abstract": "Early detection and intervention of atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cornerstone for effective treatment and prevention of mortality. Diverse deep learning models (DLMs) have been developed, but they could not be applied in clinical practice owing to their lack of interpretability. We developed an explainable DLM to detect AF using ECG and validated its performance using diverse formats of ECG.\nWe conducted a retrospective study. The Sejong ECG dataset comprising 128,399 ECGs was used to develop and internally validated the explainable DLM. DLM was developed with two feature modules, which could describe the reason for DLM decisions. DLM was external validated using data from 21,837, 10,605, and 8528 ECGs from PTB-XL, Chapman, and PhysioNet non-restricted datasets, respectively. The predictor variables were digitally stored ECGs, and the endpoints were AFs.\nDuring internal and external validation of the DLM, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the DLM using a 12\u2011lead ECG in detecting AF were 0.997-0.999. The AUCs of the DLM with VAE using a 6\u2011lead and single\u2011lead ECG were 0.990-0.999. The AUCs of explainability about features such as rhythm irregularity and absence of P-wave were 0.961-0.993 and 0.983-0.993, respectively.\nOur DLM successfully detected AF using diverse ECGs and described the reason for this decision. The results indicated that an explainable artificial intelligence methodology could be adopted to the DLM using ECG and enhance the transparency of the DLM for its application in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease in which genetic factors contribute approximately 70% of etiological effects. Studies have found many significant genetic and environmental factors, but the pathogenesis of AD is still unclear. With the application of microarray and next-generation sequencing technologies, research using genetic data has shown explosive growth. In addition to conventional statistical methods for the processing of these data, artificial intelligence (AI) technology shows obvious advantages in analyzing such complex projects. This article first briefly reviews the application of AI technology in medicine and the current status of genetic research in AD. Then, a comprehensive review is focused on the application of AI in the genetic research of AD, including the diagnosis and prognosis of AD based on genetic data, the analysis of genetic variation, gene expression profile, gene-gene interaction in AD, and genetic analysis of AD based on a knowledge base. Although many studies have yielded some meaningful results, they are still in a preliminary stage. The main shortcomings include the limitations of the databases, failing to take advantage of AI to conduct a systematic biology analysis of multilevel databases, and lack of a theoretical framework for the analysis results. Finally, we outlook the direction of future development. It is crucial to develop high quality, comprehensive, large sample size, data sharing resources; a multi-level system biology AI analysis strategy is one of the development directions, and computational creativity may play a role in theory model building, verification, and designing new intervention protocols for AD.",

    "abstract": "Prediction of survival after the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been widely investigated, yet remains inadequate. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a valid adjunct to traditional statistics due to the ability to process vast amounts of data and find hidden interconnections between variables. AI and deep learning are increasingly employed in several topics of liver cancer research, including diagnosis, pathology, and prognosis.\nTo assess the role of AI in the prediction of survival following HCC treatment.\nA web-based literature search was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines using the keywords \"artificial intelligence\", \"deep learning\" and \"hepatocellular carcinoma\" (and synonyms). The specific research question was formulated following the patient (patients with HCC), intervention (evaluation of HCC treatment using AI), comparison (evaluation without using AI), and outcome (patient death and/or tumor recurrence) structure. English language articles were retrieved, screened, and reviewed by the authors. The quality of the papers was assessed using the Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions tool. Data were extracted and collected in a database.\nAmong the 598 articles screened, nine papers met the inclusion criteria, six of which had low-risk rates of bias. Eight articles were published in the last decade; all came from eastern countries. Patient sample size was extremely heterogenous (\nAI applied to survival prediction after HCC treatment provided enhanced accuracy compared with conventional linear systems of analysis. Improved transferability and reproducibility will facilitate the widespread use of AI methodologies.",

Optical computing systems may be able to meet these domain-specific needs but, despite half a century of research, general-purpose optical computing systems have yet to mature into a practical technology.

The metrics and visualizations exemplify the emergence and convergence of three areas of strategic interest: artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and internet of things (IoT) over the last 20 years (1998-2017). For 32,716 publications and 4,497 NSF awards, we identify their topical coverage (using the UCSD map of science), evolving co-author networks, and increasing convergence. The results support data-driven decision making when setting proper research and development (R&D) priorities; developing future S&T investment strategies; or performing effective research program assessment.",

    "abstract": "In the gait recognition problem, most studies are devoted to developing gait descriptors rather than introducing new classification methods. This paper proposes hybrid methods that combine regularized discriminant analysis (RDA) and swarm intelligence techniques for gait recognition. The purpose of this study is to develop strategies that will achieve better gait recognition results than those achieved by classical classification methods. In our approach, particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) are used. These techniques tune the observation weights and hyperparameters of the RDA method to minimize the objective function. The experiments conducted on the GPJATK dataset proved the validity of the proposed concept.",

    "abstract": "Nearly one-quarter of all cancer deaths worldwide are due to lung cancer, making this disease the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women. The most important determinant of survival in lung cancer is the disease stage at diagnosis, thus developing an effective screening method for early diagnosis has been a long-term goal in lung cancer care. In the last decade, and based on the results of large clinical trials, lung cancer screening programs using low-dose computer tomography (LDCT) in high-risk individuals have been implemented in some clinical settings, however, this method has various limitations, especially a high false-positive rate which eventually results in a number of unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions among the screened subjects. By using complex algorithms and software, artificial intelligence (AI) is capable to emulate human cognition in the analysis, interpretation, and comprehension of complicated data and currently, it is being successfully applied in various healthcare settings. Taking advantage of the ability of AI to quantify information from images, and its superior capability in recognizing complex patterns in images compared to humans, AI has the potential to aid clinicians in the interpretation of LDCT images obtained in the setting of lung cancer screening. In the last decade, several AI models aimed to improve lung cancer detection have been reported. Some algorithms performed equal or even outperformed experienced radiologists in distinguishing benign from malign lung nodules and some of those models improved diagnostic accuracy and decreased the false-positive rate. Here, we discuss recent publications in which AI algorithms are utilized to assess chest computer tomography (CT) scans imaging obtaining in the setting of lung cancer screening.",

    "abstract": "Imaging evaluation of the cerebral ventricles is important for clinical decision-making in pediatric hydrocephalus. Although quantitative measurements of ventricular size, over time, can facilitate objective comparison, automated tools for calculating ventricular volume are not structured for clinical use. The authors aimed to develop a fully automated deep learning (DL) model for pediatric cerebral ventricle segmentation and volume calculation for widespread clinical implementation across multiple hospitals.\nThe study cohort consisted of 200 children with obstructive hydrocephalus from four pediatric hospitals, along with 199 controls. Manual ventricle segmentation and volume calculation values served as \"ground truth\" data. An encoder-decoder convolutional neural network architecture, in which T2-weighted MR images were used as input, automatically delineated the ventricles and output volumetric measurements. On a held-out test set, segmentation accuracy was assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (0 to 1) and volume calculation was assessed using linear regression. Model generalizability was evaluated on an external MRI data set from a fifth hospital. The DL model performance was compared against FreeSurfer research segmentation software.\nModel segmentation performed with an overall Dice score of 0.901 (0.946 in hydrocephalus, 0.856 in controls). The model generalized to external MR images from a fifth pediatric hospital with a Dice score of 0.926. The model was more accurate than FreeSurfer, with faster operating times (1.48 seconds per scan).\nThe authors present a DL model for automatic ventricle segmentation and volume calculation that is more accurate and rapid than currently available methods. With near-immediate volumetric output and reliable performance across institutional scanner types, this model can be adapted to the real-time clinical evaluation of hydrocephalus and improve clinician workflow.",

    "abstract": "Follow-up of aortic aneurysms by computed tomography (CT) is crucial to balance the risks of treatment and rupture. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted radiology reporting promises time savings and reduced inter-reader variabilities.\nThe influence of AI assistance on the efficiency and accuracy of aortic aneurysm reporting according to the AHA / ESC guidelines was quantified based on 324 AI measurements and 1944 radiological measurements: 18 aortic aneurysm patients, each with two CT scans (arterial contrast phase, electrocardiogram-gated) with an interval of at least six months have been included. One board-certified radiologist and two residents (8/4/2 years of experience in vascular imaging) independently assessed aortic diameters at nine landmark positions. Aneurysm extensions were compared with original CT reports. After three weeks washout period, CTs were re-assessed, based on graphically illustrated AI measurements.\nTime-consuming guideline-compliant aortic measurements revealed additional affections of the root / arch for 80 % of aneurysms that had initially been reported to be limited to the ascending aorta. AI assistance reduced mean reporting time by 63 % from 13:01 to 04:46\u202fmin including manual corrections of AI measurements (performed for 33.6 % of all measurements with predominance at the sinuses of Vasalva). AI assistance reduced total diameter inter-reader variability by 42.5 % (0.42 / 1.16\u202fmm with / without AI assistance, mean of all patients and landmark positions, significant reduction for 6 out of 9 measuring positions). Conventional and AI-assisted quantification aneurysm progress varied to small extent (mean of 0.75\u202fmm over all patients / landmark positions) not significantly exceeding radiologist's inter-reader variabilities.\nGuideline-compliant aorta measurement is crucial to report detailed aneurysm extension which might affect the strategy of interventional repair. AI assistance promises improved reporting efficiency and has high potential to reduce radiologist's inter-reader variabilities that can hamper diagnostic follow-up accuracy.\nThe time-consuming guideline-compliant aorta aneurysm assessment is crucial to report aneurysm extension in detail; AI-assisted measurement reduces reporting time, improves extension evaluation and reduces inter-reader variability.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) raises many expectations regarding its ability to profoundly transform health care delivery. There is an abundant literature on the technical performance of AI applications in many clinical fields (e.g. radiology, ophthalmology). This article aims to bring forward the importance of studying organizational readiness to integrate AI into health care delivery.\nThe reflection is based on our experience in digital health technologies, diffusion of innovations and healthcare organizations and systems. It provides insights into why and how organizational readiness should be carefully considered.\nAs an important step to ensure successful integration of AI and avoid unnecessary investments and costly failures, better consideration should be given to: (1) Needs and added-value assessment; (2) Workplace readiness: stakeholder acceptance and engagement; (3) Technology-organization alignment assessment and (4) Business plan: financing and investments. In summary, decision-makers and technology promoters should better address the complexity of AI and understand the systemic challenges raised by its implementation in healthcare organizations and systems.\nFew studies have focused on the organizational issues raised by the integration of AI into clinical routine. The current context is marked by a perplexing gap between the willingness of decision-makers and technology promoters to capitalize on AI applications to improve health care delivery and the reality on the ground, where it is difficult to initiate the changes needed to realize their full benefits while avoiding their negative impacts.",

    "abstract": "Preliminary evidence concerning emotional intelligence (EI) and working memory (WM) showed that the relationship between them is dependent on the emotional content ('hot' or 'cool') of tasks involving WM. In this paper, we continue investigating the relationship between EI and WM, focusing on a crucial function of WM, i.e., the efficacy of updating its content. WM updating shows substantial correlations with general fluid intelligence (gF) and seems to be a significant predictor of cognitive performance and achievement. We assume that if updating is important for a wide range of higher-order processes, updating emotional content in WM could be essential for emotionally intelligent behavior. To test this hypothesis, we constructed two parallel versions of a task that requires WM updating: one with neutral and the other with emotional stimuli. In addition, performance-based measures of both gF and EI were used in the research. Using the structural equation approach, we sought to demonstrate that gF is dependent on the efficiency of WM updating for both emotional and neutral stimuli, whereas EI might depend only on the updating efficacy in the emotional context. The results are discussed in terms of the domain specificity of EI and the domain generality of gF. The main constraint of the study is its limited sample size (n\u2009=\u2009123 for intelligence measures, n\u2009=\u200969 for WM updating tasks). Moreover, the study was based on a female sample; thus, the conclusions can be extrapolated only to women.",

    "abstract": "Explainability is one of the most heavily debated topics when it comes to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. Even though AI-driven systems have been shown to outperform humans in certain analytical tasks, the lack of explainability continues to spark criticism. Yet, explainability is not a purely technological issue, instead it invokes a host of medical, legal, ethical, and societal questions that require thorough exploration. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the role of explainability in medical AI and makes an ethical evaluation of what explainability means for the adoption of AI-driven tools into clinical practice.\nTaking AI-based clinical decision support systems as a case in point, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the relevance of explainability for medical AI from the technological, legal, medical, and patient perspectives. Drawing on the findings of this conceptual analysis, we then conducted an ethical assessment using the \"Principles of Biomedical Ethics\" by Beauchamp and Childress (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice) as an analytical framework to determine the need for explainability in medical AI.\nEach of the domains highlights a different set of core considerations and values that are relevant for understanding the role of explainability in clinical practice. From the technological point of view, explainability has to be considered both in terms how it can be achieved and what is beneficial from a development perspective. When looking at the legal perspective we identified informed consent, certification and approval as medical devices, and liability as core touchpoints for explainability. Both the medical and patient perspectives emphasize the importance of considering the interplay between human actors and medical AI. We conclude that omitting explainability in clinical decision support systems poses a threat to core ethical values in medicine and may have detrimental consequences for individual and public health.\nTo ensure that medical AI lives up to its promises, there is a need to sensitize developers, healthcare professionals, and legislators to the challenges and limitations of opaque algorithms in medical AI and to foster multidisciplinary collaboration moving forward.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of the era of artificial intelligence, radiomics is an emerging field in which high-throughput imaging data are extracted from different types of images to model and predict clinical prognosis in a non-invasive manner. Currently, this field is in its initial stage of development and lacks standardized assessment criteria, but still remains a promising tool for the future research direction. Radiomics analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma will aid in the early diagnosis, prognostic evaluation and treatment plan, thereby promoting the continuous improvement of clinical treatment strategies, and providing precise treatment methods to improve the survival rate and cure rate of patients.

    "abstract": "In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have led to the rapid clinical implementation of devices with AI technology in the medical field. More than 60 AI-equipped medical devices have already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, and the active introduction of AI technology is considered to be an inevitable trend in the future of medicine. In the field of oncology, clinical applications of medical devices using AI technology are already underway, mainly in radiology, and AI technology is expected to be positioned as an important core technology. In particular, \"precision medicine,\" a medical treatment that selects the most appropriate treatment for each patient based on a vast amount of medical data such as genome information, has become a worldwide trend; AI technology is expected to be utilized in the process of extracting truly useful information from a large amount of medical data and applying it to diagnosis and treatment. In this review, we would like to introduce the history of AI technology and the current state of medical AI, especially in the oncology field, as well as discuss the possibilities and challenges of AI technology in the medical field.",

    "abstract": "Technology has been integrated into every facet of human life, and whether it is completely advantageous remains unknown, but one thing is for sure; we are dependent on technology. Medical advances from the integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and augmented realities are widespread and have helped countless patients. Much of the advanced technology utilized by medical providers today has been borrowed and extrapolated from other industries. There remains no great collaboration between providers and engineers, which may be why medicine is only in its infancy of innovation with regards to advanced technologic integration. The purpose of this narrative review is to highlight the different technologies currently being utilized in a variety of medical specialties. Furthermore, we hope that by bringing attention to one shortcoming of the medical community, we may inspire future innovators to seek collaboration outside of the purely medical community for the betterment of all patients seeking care.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to develop and validate a real-time deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) system for detecting early gastric cancer (EGC).\nAll 45,240 endoscopic images from 1364 patients were divided into a training dataset (35823 images from 1085 patients) and a validation dataset (9417 images from 279 patients). Another 1514 images from three other hospitals were used as external validation. We compared the diagnostic performance of the DCNN system with endoscopists, and then evaluated the performance of endoscopists with or without referring to the system. Thereafter, we evaluated the diagnostic ability of the DCNN system in video streams. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and Cohen's kappa coefficient were measured to assess the detection performance.\nThe DCNN system showed good performance in EGC detection in validation datasets, with accuracy (85.1%-91.2%), sensitivity (85.9%-95.5%), specificity (81.7%-90.3%), and AUC (0.887-0.940). The DCNN system showed better diagnostic performance than endoscopists and improved the performance of endoscopists. The DCNN system was able to process oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) video streams to detect EGC lesions in real time.\nWe developed a real-time DCNN system for EGC detection with high accuracy and stability. Multicentre prospective validation is needed to acquire high-level evidence for its clinical application.\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 81672935 and 81871947), Jiangsu Clinical Medical Center of Digestive System Diseases and Gastrointestinal Cancer (grant no.

    "abstract": "To analyze artificial intelligence image-assisted knee ligament injury repair and femoral nerve block analgesia after surgery.\nData-driven and artificial intelligence methods were adopted to systematically study magnetic resonance imaging image reconstruction, processing, and analysis. First, knee ligament reconstruction and femoral arteriography images were studied. Using the prior knowledge that the full width at half maximum of the contrast image does not change with the resolution, a constrained data exploration algorithm was proposed combined with the iterative algorithm. The algorithm could reconstruct high-resolution images using the collected low-frequency data of k-space. The experimental data and results were simulated with the enhanced knee ligaments and femoral nerve angiography images. Combining the spatial continuity of knee ligaments and femoral nerve, a multilayer input segmentation network was designed. The multisupervised network was adopted for output and had good segmentation results for the knee ligaments and femoral nerve. On this basis, a multiparametric image input speaker net was proposed to detect knee ligament injuries.\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the constructed model under the test set was 0.824, and the sensitivity and specificity were 0.800 and 0.836, respectively. The image was better than compressed sensing to reconstruct the image, which was more accurate for knee ligament and femoral nerve stenosis. The network also had higher sensitivity for knee joint trauma detection, which could aid clinicians. The postoperative femoral nerve block had a good detection effect, which could provide important information for clinical analgesia.\nThe artificial intelligence image-assisted diagnosis system for analysis and processing of multiparametric magnetic resonance images is useful for clinical decision making, reducing physicians' labor intensity, improving efficiency, and lowering the rate of misdiagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to a person's ability to acknowledge the feelings of oneself and others, and to control those feelings so as to behave in a socially acceptable manner. We investigated the relationships between the characteristics of EI among nurse managers, and their perceptions of how much their position's roles and responsibilities can be delegated to other staff members.\nWe surveyed 150 nurse managers working at 30 hospitals by using an anonymous questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of basic attributes, EI and work perception. The emotional intelligence scale (EQS) domain scores were analyzed by means of one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. EQS scores were compared with corresponding averages for working adults in the instructions. The perceived importance of duties of nurse managers was compared between the resulting EQS scores 'High' and 'Low' groups.\nThe analysis population consisted of 105 nurse managers. Their EQS scored higher in all three domains, and with the exception of Altruism for all factor scores than the average for working adults. The perceived importance of the typical duties of nurse managers were compared between the High and Low groups for each EQS domain. Significant differences were observed between nurse managers with High and Low Intrapersonal emotional quotient (EQ) on four tasks. No significant differences were found for any of the responsibilities when nurse managers with High and Low Interpersonal EQ or Situational EQ were compared.\nThe nurse managers' average EQS scores were higher in all areas. The high scores that were exhibited by could be considered desirable qualities for nurse managers. It seemed nurse managers with high scores in intrapersonal EQ struck a good balance between placing importance on EI considerations like managing relationships and creating a comfortable workplace, and management and leadership behaviors like department management and operations and data management.",

Their EQS scored higher in all three domains, and with the exception of Altruism for all factor scores than the average for working adults. The perceived importance of the typical duties of nurse managers were compared between the High and Low groups for each EQS domain. Significant differences were observed between nurse managers with High and Low Intrapersonal emotional quotient (EQ) on four tasks. No significant differences were found for any of the responsibilities when nurse managers with High and Low Interpersonal EQ or Situational EQ were compared.",

    "abstract": "To assess awareness and knowledge of Interventional Radiology (IR) in a large population of medical students in 2019.\nAn anonymous survey was distributed electronically to 9546 medical students from first to sixth year at three European medical schools. The survey contained 14 questions, including two general questions on diagnostic radiology (DR) and artificial intelligence (AI), and 11 on IR. Responses were analyzed for all students and compared between preclinical (PCs) (first to third year) and clinical phase (Cs) (fourth to sixth year) of medical school. Of 9546 students, 1459 students (15.3%) answered the survey.\nOn DR questions, 34.8% answered that AI is a threat for radiologists (PCs: 246/725 (33.9%); Cs: 248/734 (36%)) and 91.1% thought that radiology has a future (PCs: 668/725 (92.1%); Cs: 657/734 (89.5%)). On IR questions, 80.8% (1179/1459) students had already heard of IR; 75.7% (1104/1459) stated that their knowledge of IR wasn't as good as the other specialties and 80% would like more lectures on IR. Finally, 24.2% (353/1459) indicated an interest in a career in IR with a majority of women in preclinical phase, but this trend reverses in clinical phase.\nDevelopment of new technology supporting advances in artificial intelligence will likely continue to change the landscape of radiology; however, medical students remain confident in the need for specialty-trained human physicians in the future of radiology as a clinical practice. A large majority of medical students would like more information about IR in their medical curriculum; almost a quarter of students would be interested in a career in IR.",

    "abstract": "The situation of an off-center casing under non-uniform ground stress can occur in the process of drilling a salt-gypsum formation, and the related casing stress calculation has not yet been solved analytically. In addition, the experimental equipment in many cases cannot meet the actual conditions and the experimental cost is very high. These comprehensive factors cause the existing casing design to not meet the actual conditions and cause casing deformation, affecting the drilling operation in Tarim oil field. The finite element method is the only effective method to solve this problem at present, but the re-modelling process is time-consuming because of the changes in the parameters, such as the cement properties, casing centrality, and the casing size. In this article, an artificial intelligence method based on support vector machine (SVM) to predict the maximum stress of an off-center casing under non-uniform ground stress has been proposed. After a program based on a radial basis function (RBF)-support vector regression (SVR) (\nSupplementary material is available for this article at 10.1007/s11431-019-1694-4 and is accessible for authorized users.",

    "abstract": "Medicine is at a disciplinary crossroads. With the rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the healthcare field the future care of our patients will depend on the decisions we make now. Demographic healthcare inequalities continue to persist worldwide and the impact of medical biases on different patient groups is still being uncovered by the research community. At a time when clinical AI systems are scaled up in response to the Covid19 pandemic, the role of AI in exacerbating health disparities must be critically reviewed. For AI to account for the past and build a better future, we must first unpack the present and create a new baseline on which to develop these tools. The means by which we move forwards will determine whether we project existing inequity into the future, or whether we reflect on what we hold to be true and challenge ourselves to be better. AI is an opportunity and a mirror for all disciplines to improve their impact on society and for medicine the stakes could not be higher.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model for cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) analysis and validate the model's output with the results of human observers.\nA total of 647 lateral cephalograms were selected from patients with 10-30\u00a0years of chronological age (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation, 15.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.13\u00a0years). New software with a decision support system was developed for manual labeling of the dataset. A total of 26 points were marked on each radiograph. The CVM stages were saved on the basis of the final decision of the observer. Fifty-four image features were saved in text format. A new subset of 72 radiographs was created according to the classification result, and these 72 radiographs were visually evaluated by 4 observers. Weighted kappa (w\u03ba) and Cohen's kappa (c\u03ba) coefficients and percentage agreement were calculated to evaluate the compatibility of the results.\nIntraobserver agreement ranges were as follows: w\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.92-0.98, c\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.65-0.85, and 70.8%-87.5%. Interobserver agreement ranges were as follows: w\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.76-0.92, c\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.4-0.65, and 50%-72.2%. Agreement between the ANN model and observers 1, 2, 3, and 4 were as follows: w\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.85 (c\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 59.7%), w\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.8 (c\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.4, 50%), w\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.87 (c\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 62.5%), and w\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.91 (c\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.53, 61.1%), respectively (P\u00a0<0.001). An average of 58.3% agreement was observed between the ANN model and the human observers.\nThis\u00a0study demonstrated that the developed ANN model performed close to, if not better than, human observers in CVM analysis. By generating new algorithms, automatic classification of CVM with artificial intelligence may replace conventional evaluation methods used in the future.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome comprises a variety of microorganisms whose genes encode proteins to carry out crucial metabolic functions that are responsible for the majority of health-related issues in human beings. The advent of the technological revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) assisted synthetic biology (SB) approaches will play a vital role in the modulating the therapeutic and nutritive potential of probiotics. This can turn human gut as a reservoir of beneficial bacterial colonies having an immense role in immunity, digestion, brain function, and other health benefits. Hence, in the present review, we have discussed the role of several gene editing tools and approaches in synthetic biology that have equipped us with novel tools like Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR-Cas) systems to precisely engineer probiotics for diagnostic, therapeutic and nutritive value. A brief discussion over the AI techniques to understand the metagenomic data from the healthy and diseased gut microbiome is also presented. Further, the role of AI in potentially impacting the pace of developments in SB and its current challenges is also discussed. The review also describes the health benefits conferred by engineered microbes through the production of biochemicals, nutraceuticals, drugs or biotherapeutics molecules etc. Finally, the review concludes with the challenges and regulatory concerns in adopting synthetic biology engineered microbes for clinical applications. Thus, the review presents a synergistic approach of AI and SB toward human gut microbiome for better health which will provide interesting clues to researchers working in the area of rapidly evolving food and nutrition science.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to disrupt how we diagnose and treat patients. Previous work by our group has demonstrated that the majority of patients and their relatives feel comfortable with the application of AI to augment surgical care. The aim of this study was to similarly evaluate the attitudes of surgeons and the wider surgical team toward the role of AI in neurosurgery.\nIn a 2-stage cross sectional survey, an initial open-question qualitative survey was created to determine the perspective of the surgical team on AI in neurosurgery including surgeons, anesthetists, nurses, and operating room practitioners. Thematic analysis was performed to develop a second-stage quantitative survey that was distributed via social media. We assessed the extent to which they agreed and were comfortable with real-world AI implementation using a 5-point Likert scale.\nIn the first-stage survey, 33 participants responded. Six main themes were identified: imaging interpretation and preoperative diagnosis, coordination of the surgical team, operative planning, real-time alert of hazards and complications, autonomous surgery, and postoperative management and follow-up. In the second stage, 100 participants responded. Responders somewhat agreed or strongly agreed about AI being used for imaging interpretation (62%), operative planning (82%), coordination of the surgical team (70%), real-time alert of hazards and complications (85%), and autonomous surgery (66%). The role of AI within postoperative management and follow-up was less agreeable (49%).\nThis survey highlights that the majority of surgeons and the wider surgical team both agree and are comfortable with the application of AI within neurosurgery.",

    "abstract": "Catheter ablation is a standard therapy for frequent premature ventricular complex (PVCs). Predicting their origin from a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is crucial but it requires specialized knowledge and experience.\nThe objective of the present study was to develop and evaluate machine learning algorithms that predicted PVC origins from an ECG.\nWe developed the algorithms utilizing a support vector machine (SVM) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The training, validating, and testing data consisted of 116 PVCs from 111 patients who underwent catheter ablation. The ECG signals were labeled with the PVC origin, which was confirmed using a 3-dimensional electroanatomical mapping system. We classified the origins into 4 groups: right or left, outflow tract, or other sites. We trained and evaluated the model performance. The testing datasets were also evaluated by board-certified electrophysiologists and an existing classification algorithm. We also developed binary classification models that predicted whether the origin was on the right or left side of the heart.\nThe weighted accuracies of the 4-class classification were as follows: SVM 0.85, CNN 0.80, electrophysiologists 0.73, and existing algorithm 0.86. The precision, recall, and F\nArtificial intelligence-enabled algorithms that predict the origin of PVCs achieved superior accuracy compared to the electrophysiologists and comparable accuracy to the existing algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Innovations in CT have been impressive among imaging and medical technologies in both the hardware and software domain. The range and speed of CT scanning improved from the introduction of multidetector-row CT scanners with wide-array detectors and faster gantry rotation speeds. To tackle concerns over rising radiation doses from its increasing use and to improve image quality, CT reconstruction techniques evolved from filtered back projection to commercial release of iterative reconstruction techniques, and recently, of deep learning (DL)-based image reconstruction. These newer reconstruction techniques enable improved or retained image quality versus filtered back projection at lower radiation doses. DL can aid in image reconstruction with training data without total reliance on the physical model of the imaging process, unique artifacts of PCD-CT due to charge sharing, K-escape, fluorescence x-ray emission, and pulse pileups can be handled in the data-driven fashion. With sufficiently reconstructed images, a well-designed network can be trained to upgrade image quality over a practical/clinical threshold or define new/killer applications. Besides, the much smaller detector pixel for PCD-CT can lead to huge computational costs with traditional model-based iterative reconstruction methods whereas deep networks can be much faster with training and validation. In this review, we present techniques, applications, uses, and limitations of deep learning-based image reconstruction methods in CT.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been great interest in developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled computer-aided diagnostics solutions for the diagnosis of skin cancer. With the increasing incidence of skin cancers, low awareness among a growing population, and a lack of adequate clinical expertise and services, there is an immediate need for AI systems to assist clinicians in this domain. A large number of skin lesion datasets are available publicly, and researchers have developed AI solutions, particularly deep learning algorithms, to distinguish malignant skin lesions from benign lesions in different image modalities such as dermoscopic, clinical, and histopathology images. Despite the various claims of AI systems achieving higher accuracy than dermatologists in the classification of different skin lesions, these AI systems are still in the very early stages of clinical application in terms of being ready to aid clinicians in the diagnosis of skin cancers. In this review, we discuss advancements in the digital image-based AI solutions for the diagnosis of skin cancer, along with some challenges and future opportunities to improve these AI systems to support dermatologists and enhance their ability to diagnose skin cancer.",

    "abstract": "The synthetic glucose receptors help to develop glucose sensors and alternative insulin therapies. Designing a glucose recognition molecule in an aqueous system remains a considerable challenge. Therefore, In-silico molecular screening hypothesis is proposed to overcome the difficulties found during the modeling of a molecule. The small organic compounds from compound databases are screened for glucose receptor modeling. Thereafter, the different computational models are designed that mimic natural glucose receptors based on screened compounds. The orientation and binding of glucose molecules within the developed receptor are predicted through the molecular interaction approach. The modeled receptors and receptor-glucose complex structures are used for geometry optimization and molecular dynamics computation. The docking results reveal that ZINC82047919, ZINC238094340, and ZINC238519600 compounds-based models provide better interactions with glucose and its orientation within the receptor cavity. The molecular dynamics simulation results showed that the receptor designed using compound ZINC238094340 is unable to hold the glucose and undergo significant conformation changes during simulation process. The receptor designed from ZINC238094340 and ZINC238519600 compounds is utilized as a reference glucose binding receptor in this study. The proposed computational approach is able to develop a novel glucose receptor and other glucose relative sugar molecules.",

    "abstract": "Significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, and other machine-learning approaches have been made in recent years, with applications found in almost every industry, including health care. AI is capable of completing a spectrum of mundane to complex medically oriented tasks previously performed only by boarded physicians, most recently assisting with the detection of cancers difficult to find on histopathology slides. Although computers will likely not replace pathologists any time soon, properly designed AI-based tools hold great potential for increasing workflow efficiency and diagnostic accuracy in pathology. Recent trends, such as data augmentation, crowdsourcing for generating annotated data sets, and unsupervised learning with molecular and/or clinical outcomes versus human diagnoses as a source of ground truth, are eliminating the direct role of pathologists in algorithm development. Proper integration of AI-based systems into anatomic-pathology practice will necessarily require fully digital imaging platforms, an overhaul of legacy information-technology infrastructures, modification of laboratory/pathologist workflows, appropriate reimbursement/cost-offsetting models, and ultimately, the active participation of pathologists to encourage buy-in and oversight. Regulations tailored to the nature and limitations of AI are currently in development and, when instituted, are expected to promote safe and effective use. This review addresses the challenges in AI development, deployment, and regulation to be overcome prior to its widespread adoption in anatomic pathology.",

    "abstract": "The neural substrate of high intelligence performances remains not well understood. Based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) which provides microstructural information of white matter fibers, we proposed in this work to investigate the relationship between structural brain connectivity and intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. Fifty-seven children (8-12 y.o.) underwent a MRI examination, including conventional T1-weighted and DTI sequences, and neuropsychological testing using the fourth edition of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV), providing an estimation of the Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) based on four subscales: verbal comprehension index (VCI), perceptual reasoning index (PRI), working memory index (WMI), and processing speed index (PSI). Correlations between the IQ scores and both graphs and diffusivity metrics were explored. First, we found significant correlations between the increased integrity of WM fiber-bundles and high intelligence scores. Second, the graph theory analysis showed that integration and segregation graph metrics were positively and negatively correlated with WISC-IV scores, respectively. These results were mainly driven by significant correlations between FSIQ, VCI, and PRI and graph metrics in the temporal and parietal lobes. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that intelligence performances are related to the integrity of WM fiber-bundles as well as the density and homogeneity of WM brain networks.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence technology is a rapidly expanding field with many applications in acute stroke imaging, including ischemic and hemorrhage subtypes. Early identification of acute stroke is critical for initiating prompt intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality. Artificial intelligence can help with various aspects of the stroke treatment paradigm, including infarct or hemorrhage detection, segmentation, classification, large vessel occlusion detection, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score grading, and prognostication. In particular, emerging artificial intelligence techniques such as convolutional neural networks show promise in performing these imaging-based tasks efficiently and accurately. The purpose of this review is twofold: first, to describe AI methods and available public and commercial platforms in stroke imaging, and second, to summarize the literature of current artificial intelligence-driven applications for acute stroke triage, surveillance, and prediction.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer causes more deaths worldwide than any other cancer. For early-stage patients, low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) of the chest is considered to be an effective screening measure for reducing the risk of mortality. The accuracy and efficiency of cancer screening would be enhanced by an intelligent and automated system that meets or surpasses the diagnostic capabilities of human experts.\nBased on the artificial intelligence (AI) technique, i.e., deep neural network (DNN), we designed a framework for lung cancer screening. First, a semi-automated annotation strategy was used to label the images for training. Then, the DNN-based models for the detection of lung nodules (LNs) and benign or malignancy classification were proposed to identify lung cancer from LDCT images. Finally, the constructed DNN-based LN detection and identification system was named as DeepLN and confirmed using a large-scale dataset.\nA dataset of multi-resolution LDCT images was constructed and annotated by a multidisciplinary group and used to train and evaluate the proposed models. The sensitivity of LN detection was 96.5% and 89.6% in a thin section subset [the free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) is 0.716] and a thick section subset (the FROC is 0.699), respectively. With an accuracy of 92.46%\u00b10.20%, a specificity of 95.93%\u00b10.47%, and a precision of 90.46%\u00b10.93%, an ensemble result of benign or malignancy identification demonstrated a very good performance. Three retrospective clinical comparisons of the DeepLN system with human experts showed a high detection accuracy of 99.02%.\nIn this study, we presented an AI-based system with the potential to improve the performance and work efficiency of radiologists in lung cancer screening. The effectiveness of the proposed system was verified through retrospective clinical evaluation. Thus, the future application of this system is expected to help patients and society.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a path-breaking advancement for many industries, including the health care sector. The expeditious development of information technology and data processing has led to the formation of recent tools known as artificial intelligence. Radiology has been a portal for medical technological advancements, and AI will likely be no dissimilar. Radiology is the platform for many technological advances in the medical field; AI can undoubtedly impact every step of a radiologist's workflow. AI can simplify every activity like ordering and scheduling, protocoling and acquisition, image interpretation, reporting, communication, and billing. AI has eminent potential to augment efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but it also possesses inherent drawbacks and biases. We collected studies that were published in the past five years using PubMed as our database. We chose studies that were relevant to artificial intelligence in radiology. We mainly focused on the overview of AI in radiology, components included in the functioning of AI, AI assisting in the radiologists' workflow, ethical aspects of AI, challenges, and biases that AI experiencing together with some clinical applications of AI. Of all 33 studies, we found 15 articles discussed the overview and components of AI, five articles about AI affecting radiologist's workflow, five articles related to challenges and biases in AI, two articles discussed ethical aspects of AI, and six articles about practical implications of AI. We found out that the application of AI could make time-dependent tasks that can be performed effortlessly, permitting radiologists more time and opportunities to engage in patient care via increased time for consultation and development in imaging and extracting useful data from those images. AI could only be an aid to radiologists but will not\u00a0replace a radiologist. Radiologists who use AI to their benefit, rather than to avoid it out of fear, might supersede those radiologists who do not.\u00a0Substantial research should be done regarding the practical implications of AI algorithms for residents curriculum and the benefits of AI in radiology.",

    "abstract": "Stem cells are primitive and precursor cells with the potential to reproduce into diverse mature and functional cell types in the body throughout the developmental stages of life. Their remarkable potential has led to numerous medical discoveries and breakthroughs in science. As a result, stem cell-based therapy has emerged as a new subspecialty in medicine. One promising stem cell being investigated is the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC), which is obtained by genetically reprogramming mature cells to convert them into embryonic-like stem cells. These iPSCs are used to study the onset of disease, drug development, and medical therapies. However, functional studies on iPSCs involve the analysis of iPSC-derived colonies through manual identification, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and training-dependent. Thus, an automated instrument for the analysis of iPSC colonies is needed. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a novel technology to tackle this challenge. In particular, deep learning, a subfield of AI, offers an automated platform for analyzing iPSC colonies and other colony-forming stem cells. Deep learning rectifies data features using a convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of multi-layered neural network that can play an innovative role in image recognition. CNNs are able to distinguish cells with high accuracy based on morphologic and textural changes. Therefore, CNNs have the potential to create a future field of deep learning tasks aimed at solving various challenges in stem cell studies. This review discusses the progress and future of CNNs in stem cell imaging for therapy and research.",

    "abstract": "In arson cases, evidence such as DNA or fingerprints is often destroyed. One of the most important evidence modalities left is relating fire accelerants to a suspect. When gasoline is used as accelerant, the aim is to find a strong indication that a gasoline sample from a fire scene is related to a sample of a suspect. Gasoline samples from a fire scene are weathered, which prohibits a straightforward comparison. We combine machine learning, thermodynamic modeling, and quantum mechanics to predict the composition of unweathered gasoline samples starting from weathered ones. Our approach predicts the initial (unweathered) composition of the sixty main components in a weathered gasoline sample, with error bars of ca. 4% when weathered up to 80% w/w. This shows that machine learning is a valuable tool for predicting the initial composition of a weathered gasoline, and thereby relating samples to suspects.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) program developed using the deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) on neck US images can predict the BRAFV600E mutation in thyroid cancer.\n469 thyroid cancers in 469 patients were included in this retrospective study. A CAD program recently developed using the deep CNN provided risks of malignancy (0-100%) as well as binary results (cancer or not). Using the CAD program, we calculated the risk of malignancy based on a US image of each thyroid nodule (CAD value). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed including patient demographics, the American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System (TIRADS) categories and risks of malignancy calculated through CAD to identify independent predictive factors for the BRAFV600E mutation in thyroid cancer. The predictive power of the CAD value and final multivariable model for the BRAFV600E mutation in thyroid cancer were measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.\nIn this study, 380 (81%) patients were positive and 89 (19%) patients were negative for the BRAFV600E mutation. On multivariate analysis, older age (OR = 1.025, p = 0.018), smaller size (OR = 0.963, p = 0.006), and higher CAD value (OR = 1.016, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with the BRAFV600E mutation. The CAD value yielded an AUC of 0.646 (95% CI: 0.576, 0.716) for predicting the BRAFV600E mutation, while the multivariable model yielded an AUC of 0.706 (95% CI: 0.576, 0.716). The multivariable model showed significantly better performance than the CAD value alone (p = 0.004).\nDeep learning-based CAD for thyroid US can help us predict the BRAFV600E mutation in thyroid cancer. More multi-center studies with more cases are needed to further validate our study results.",

    "abstract": "We present a universal platform to synchronously analyze the possible existing state of two protein biomarkers. This platform is based on the integration of three logic gates: NAND, OR and NOT. These logic gates were constructed by the principle of immune recognition and fluorescence quenching between fluorescein labelled antibodies/antigens and antibody-conjugated graphene oxide (GO). An artificial intelligence (AI) protein analysis process was designed by us and accordingly a small program was written in JAVA. This protein analysis process with its JAVA code may be applied to give logic judgments on the possible existing state of two protein components. We expect that our fundamental research on multiple biomarker analysis can provide potential application in AI-assisted medical diagnosis with the interface for remote medical treatment.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) together result in an enormous burden on global healthcare. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a well-established biomarker of CKD and is associated with adverse cardiac events. This review highlights the link between eGFR reduction and that of atherosclerosis progression, which increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. In general, CVD risk assessments are performed using conventional risk prediction models. However, since these conventional models were developed for a specific cohort with a unique risk profile and further these models do not consider atherosclerotic plaque-based phenotypes, therefore, such models can either underestimate or overestimate the risk of CVD events. This review examined the approaches used for CVD risk assessments in CKD patients using the concept of integrated risk factors. An integrated risk factor approach is one that combines the effect of conventional risk predictors and non-invasive carotid ultrasound image-based phenotypes. Furthermore, this review provided insights into novel artificial intelligence methods, such as machine learning and deep learning algorithms, to carry out accurate and automated CVD risk assessments and survival analyses in patients with CKD.",

    "abstract": "Advances in deep learning and neural networking have allowed clinicians to understand the impact that artificial intelligence (AI) could have on improving clinical outcomes and resources expenditures. In the realm of genitourinary (GU) cancers, AI has had particular success in improving the diagnosis and treatment of prostate, renal, and bladder cancers. Numerous studies have developed methods to utilize neural networks to automate prognosis prediction, treatment plan optimization, and patient education. Furthermore, many groups have explored other techniques, including digital pathology and expert 3D modeling systems. Compared to established methods, nearly all the studies showed some level of improvement and there is evidence that AI pipelines can reduce the subjectivity in the diagnosis and management of GU malignancies. However, despite the many potential benefits of utilizing AI in urologic oncology, there are some notable limitations of AI when combating real-world data sets. Thus, it is vital that more prospective studies be conducted that will allow for a better understanding of the benefits of AI to both cancer patients and urologists.",

    "abstract": "Rapid diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) using electrocardiography (ECG) is the cornerstone of effective treatment and prevention of mortality; however, conventional interpretation methods has low reliability for detecting MI and is difficulty to apply to limb 6-lead ECG based life type or wearable devices. We developed and validated a deep learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm (DLA) for detecting MI using 6-lead ECG. A total of 412,461 ECGs were used to develop a variational autoencoder (VAE) that reconstructed precordial 6-lead ECG using limb 6-lead ECG. Data from 9536, 1301, and 1768 ECGs of adult patients who underwent coronary angiography within 24\u00a0h from each ECG were used for development, internal and external validation, respectively. During internal and external validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the DLA with VAE using a 6-lead ECG were 0.880 and 0.854, respectively, and the performances were preserved by the territory of the coronary lesion. Our DLA successfully detected MI using a 12-lead ECG or a 6-lead ECG. The results indicate that MI could be detected not only with a conventional 12 lead ECG but also with a life type 6-lead ECG device that employs our DLA.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated whether health-promoting behaviours mediate the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and well-being and health outcomes in the unemployed population. Spanish unemployed (N\u2009=\u2009530) completed questionnaires of EI, health-promoting lifestyles, subjective well-being and perceived health. Path-analytic results showed that EI predicted well-being and self-reported health. Health-promoting behaviours: spiritual growth, stress management and physical activity, partially mediated the link between EI and well-being and health outcomes. Findings are discussed in terms of the role that promoting health behaviours might play regarding to well-being and health outcomes after job-loss, and in developing of EI and health-promotion programmes for unemployed populations.",

    "abstract": "Background There are characteristic findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on chest images. An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to detect COVID-19 on chest radiographs might be useful for triage or infection control within a hospital setting, but prior reports have been limited by small data sets, poor data quality, or both. Purpose To present DeepCOVID-XR, a deep learning AI algorithm to detect COVID-19 on chest radiographs, that was trained and tested on a large clinical data set. Materials and Methods DeepCOVID-XR is an ensemble of convolutional neural networks developed to detect COVID-19 on frontal chest radiographs, with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test results as the reference standard. The algorithm was trained and validated on 14\u2009788 images (4253 positive for COVID-19) from sites across the Northwestern Memorial Health Care System from February 2020 to April 2020 and was then tested on 2214 images (1192 positive for COVID-19) from a single hold-out institution. Performance of the algorithm was compared with interpretations from five experienced thoracic radiologists on 300 random test images using the McNemar test for sensitivity and specificity and the DeLong test for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results A total of 5853 patients (mean age, 58 years \u00b1 19 [standard deviation]; 3101 women) were evaluated across data sets. For the entire test set, accuracy of DeepCOVID-XR was 83%, with an AUC of 0.90. For 300 random test images (134 positive for COVID-19), accuracy of DeepCOVID-XR was 82%, compared with that of individual radiologists (range, 76%-81%) and the consensus of all five radiologists (81%). DeepCOVID-XR had a significantly higher sensitivity (71%) than one radiologist (60%, ",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have been more and more established for the screening and detection of diseases and pathologies, as well as for describing interactions between measures where classical methods are too complex or fail. The purpose of this paper is to model the measured postoperative position of an intraocular lens implant after cataract surgery, based on preoperatively assessed biometric effect sizes using techniques of machine learning.\nIn this study, we enrolled 249 eyes of patients who underwent elective cataract surgery at Augenklinik Castrop-Rauxel. Eyes were measured preoperatively with the IOLMaster 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec), as well as preoperatively and postoperatively with the Casia 2 OCT (Tomey). Based on preoperative effect sizes axial length, corneal thickness, internal anterior chamber depth, thickness of the crystalline lens, mean corneal radius and corneal diameter a selection of 17 machine learning algorithms were tested for prediction performance for calculation of internal anterior chamber depth (AQD_post) and axial position of equatorial plane of the lens in the pseudophakic eye (LEQ_post).\nThe 17 machine learning algorithms (out of 4 families) varied in root mean squared/mean absolute prediction error between 0.187/0.139\u2009mm and 0.255/0.204\u2009mm (AQD_post) and 0.183/0.135\u2009mm and 0.253/0.206\u2009mm (LEQ_post), using 5-fold cross validation techniques. The Gaussian Process Regression Model using an exponential kernel showed the best performance in terms of root mean squared error for prediction of AQDpost and LEQpost. If the entire dataset is used (without splitting for training and validation data), comparison of a simple multivariate linear regression model vs. the algorithm with the best performance showed a root mean squared prediction error for AQD_post/LEQ_post with 0.188/0.187\u2009mm vs. the best performance Gaussian Process Regression Model with 0.166/0.159\u2009mm.\nIn this paper we wanted to show the principles of supervised machine learning applied to prediction of the measured physical postoperative axial position of the intraocular lenses. Based on our limited data pool and the algorithms used in our setting, the benefit of machine learning algorithms seems to be limited compared to a standard multivariate regression model.\nIn den vergangenen Jahren wurden zunehmend Systeme der k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz in der Medizin etabliert, die Pathologien oder Erkrankungen erkennen und schwer zu erfassende Zusammenh\u00e4nge zwischen Eingangsgr\u00f6\u00dfen beschreiben sollen. Ziel der Studie ist es, anhand von biometrischen Messgr\u00f6\u00dfen vor der Kataraktoperation die physikalische Position der Intraokularlinse nach der Operation mit Verfahren des maschinellen Lernens vorherzusagen.\n249 Augen von Patienten, die sich zur elektiven Kataraktoperation an der Augenklinik Castrop-Rauxel vorstellten, wurden mit dem IOLMaster 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec) und vor sowie nach der Operation mit dem Casia 2 (Tomey) untersucht. Aus den Effektgr\u00f6\u00dfen Augenl\u00e4nge, Hornhautdicke, interne Vorderkammertiefe, Linsendicke, mittlerer Hornhautradius und Hornhautdurchmesser wurde eine Auswahl von 17 Algorithmen des Maschinenlernens auf ihre Vorhersagequalit\u00e4t hin getestet f\u00fcr die Bestimmung der postoperativen internen Vorderkammertiefe (AQD_post) und der Lage des Linsen\u00e4quators relativ zum Hornhautscheitel (LEQ_post).\nDie 17 Modelle (4 Algorithmusfamilien) variierten im mittleren quadratischen/mittleren absoluten Vorhersagefehler zwischen 0,187/0,139\u2009mm und 0,255/0,204\u2009mm (AQD_post) und 0,183/0,135\u2009mm und 0,253/0,206\u2009mm (LEQ_post) bei einer Kreuzvalidierung (5-fold cross validation). Der Algorithmus mit der besten Performance war bei beiden Vorhersagen ein Gaussian Process Regression Model mit einem exponentiellen Kernel. Pr\u00fcft man am gesamten Datensatz (ohne Aufteilung in Trainings- und Validierungsdaten) ein einfaches multiples lineares Regressionsmodell gegen den Algorithmus mit der besten Performance, so ergibt sich bei der Vorhersage von AQD_post/LEQ_post ein mittlerer quadratischer Vorhersagefehler von 0,188/0,187\u2009mm gegen\u00fcber dem Gaussian Process Regression Model mit 0,166/0,159\u2009mm.\nIn der Arbeit soll das Prinzip des \u00fcberwachten Maschinenlernens in der Anwendung auf die Nachbildung der physikalisch gemessenen postoperativen axialen Position von Intraokularlinsen gezeigt werden. Bei den vorliegenden Daten ist der Gewinn durch die Verwendung von Algorithmen des maschinellen Lernens (bei den hier verwendeten Algorithmen) gegen\u00fcber einem multiplen linearen Regressionsansatz gering.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the diagnostic performance of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system for detection of COVID-19 in chest radiographs (CXR), and compare results to those of physicians working alone, or with AI support.\nAn AI system was fine-tuned to discriminate confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, from other viral and bacterial pneumonia and non-pneumonia patients and used to review 302 CXR images from adult patients retrospectively sourced from nine different databases. Fifty-four physicians blind to diagnosis, were invited to interpret images under identical conditions in a test set, and randomly assigned either to receive or not receive support from the AI system. Comparisons were then made between diagnostic performance of physicians working with and without AI support. AI system performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), and sensitivity and specificity of physician performance compared to that of the AI system.\nDiscrimination by the AI system of COVID-19 pneumonia showed an AUROC curve of 0.96 in the validation and 0.83 in the external test set, respectively. The AI system outperformed physicians in the AUROC overall (70% increase in sensitivity and 1% increase in specificity, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). When working with AI support, physicians increased their diagnostic sensitivity from 47% to 61% (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), although specificity decreased from 79% to 75% (p\u202f=\u202f0.007).\nOur results suggest interpreting chest radiographs (CXR) supported by AI, increases physician diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19 detection. This approach involving a human-machine partnership may help expedite triaging efforts and improve resource allocation in the current crisis.",

    "abstract": "Observations abound about the power of visual imagery in human intelligence, from how Nobel prize-winning physicists make their discoveries to how children understand bedtime stories. These observations raise an important question for cognitive science, which is, what are the computations taking place in someone's mind when they use visual imagery? Answering this question is not easy and will require much continued research across the multiple disciplines of cognitive science. Here, we focus on a related and more circumscribed question from the perspective of artificial intelligence (AI): If you have an intelligent agent that uses visual imagery-based knowledge representations and reasoning operations, then what kinds of problem solving might be possible, and how would such problem solving work? We highlight recent progress in AI toward answering these questions in the domain of visuospatial reasoning, looking at a case study of how imagery-based artificial agents can solve visuospatial intelligence tests. In particular, we first examine several variations of imagery-based knowledge representations and problem-solving strategies that are sufficient for solving problems from the Raven's Progressive Matrices intelligence test. We then look at how artificial agents, instead of being designed manually by AI researchers, might learn portions of their own knowledge and reasoning procedures from experience, including learning visuospatial domain knowledge, learning and generalizing problem-solving strategies, and learning the actual definition of the task in the first place.",

    "abstract": "Despite intelligence research being among the most replicable bodies of empirical findings-a Rosetta stone across the social sciences-the communication of intelligence research with non-intelligence researchers and the public remains a challenge, especially given ongoing public controversies throughout the history of the field. Hunt argued that \"we have a communication problem.\" This article is a call for intelligence researchers to consider communication at multiple levels-communication with other intelligence researchers, communication with non-intelligence researchers, and communication with the public, defined here as policymakers, practitioners, students, and general readers. It discusses ongoing tensions between academic freedom and social responsibility and provides suggestions for thinking about communication and effective research translation and implementation of intelligence research from the frameworks of science and policy research communication. It concludes with some recommendations for effective communication and stresses the importance of incentivizing more scholars to responsibly seek to educate and engage with multiple publics about the science of intelligence.",

    "abstract": "With recent transformations in medical education, the integration of technology to improve medical students' abilities has become feasible. Artificial intelligence (AI) has impacted several aspects of healthcare. However, few studies have focused on medical education. We performed an AI-assisted education study and confirmed that AI can accelerate trainees' medical image learning.\nWe developed an AI-based medical image learning system to highlight hip fracture on a plain pelvic film. Thirty medical students were divided into a conventional (CL) group and an AI-assisted learning (AIL) group. In the CL group, the participants received a prelearning test and a postlearning test. In the AIL group, the participants received another test with AI-assisted education before the postlearning test. Then, we analyzed changes in diagnostic accuracy.\nThe prelearning performance was comparable in both groups. In the CL group, postlearning accuracy (78.66\u2009\u00b1\u200914.53) was higher than prelearning accuracy (75.86\u2009\u00b1\u200911.36) with no significant difference (p\u2009=\u2009.264). The AIL group showed remarkable improvement. The WithAI score (88.87\u2009\u00b1\u20095.51) was significantly higher than the prelearning score (75.73\u2009\u00b1\u200910.58, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Moreover, the postlearning score (84.93\u2009\u00b1\u200914.53) was better than the prelearning score (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The increase in accuracy was significantly higher in the AIL group than in the CL group.\nThe study demonstrated the viability of AI for augmenting medical education. Integrating AI into medical education requires dynamic collaboration from research, clinical, and educational perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Technological innovations such as artificial intelligence and robotics may be of potential use in telemedicine and in building capacity to respond to future pandemics beyond the current COVID-19 era. Our international consortium of interdisciplinary experts in clinical medicine, health policy, and telemedicine have identified gaps in uptake and implementation of telemedicine or telehealth across geographics and medical specialties. This paper discusses various artificial intelligence and robotics-assisted telemedicine or telehealth applications during COVID-19 and presents an alternative artificial intelligence assisted telemedicine framework to accelerate the rapid deployment of telemedicine and improve access to quality and cost-effective healthcare. We postulate that the artificial intelligence assisted telemedicine framework would be indispensable in creating futuristic and resilient health systems that can support communities amidst pandemics.",

    "abstract": "In the present article, we will provide an understanding and review of artificial intelligence in the subspecialty of retina and its potential applications within the specialty.\nGiven the significant use of diagnostic imaging within retina, this subspecialty is a fitting area for the incorporation of artificial intelligence. Researchers have aimed at creating models to assist in the diagnosis and management of retinal disease as well as in the prediction of disease course and treatment response. Most of this work thus far has focused on diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity, although other retinal diseases have started to be explored as well.\nArtificial intelligence is well-suited to transform the practice of ophthalmology. A basic understanding of the technology is important for its effective implementation and growth.",

Findings indicated highest mean value of emotional intelligence for motivation and empathy. Majority students showed active problem and emotional coping behavior; however, a strong, positive correlation between emotional intelligence and stress coping style was found for the domains associated with Active Emotional and Problem Coping (\u03b1\u2009\u2a7d\u20090.05). It revealed that students are efficient in utilizing stress coping strategies and recommended that professors should provide guidance to students regarding emotional intelligence and stress coping styles.",

    "abstract": "Any first step in organisational adaptation starts with individuals' responses and willingness (or otherwise) to change an aspect of themselves given the transcontextual settings in which they are operating (Bateson in Small arcs of larger circles: framing through other patterns, Triarchy Press, Axminster, 2018). This research explores the implications for organisational adaptation strategies when Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being embedded into the ecology of the organisation, and when employees have a dominant fixed or growth mindset (Dweck in Mindset: changing the way you think to fulfil your potential. Robinson, London, 2017). Research participants were supplied with a single scenario based in 2030, where-as a result of Artificial Intelligence technology implementation-employees were going to be displaced. Using Torbert's (Organizational wisdom and executive courage, New Lexington Press, San Francisco, 1998) 'first, second and third person' research theory, participants were asked to independently review their thoughts, sense, and image of the future from a fixed mindset position (considered to be the worst case), then from a growth mindset perspective (best case), and then do the same collectively. Five key findings are outlined which support the principle that having a growth mindset is a key component of adaptive capacity and futures literacy. The five key findings conclude that AI adaptation processes need to include compassion and authenticity, embodiment, fundamental needs and motivations, mutual learning and considering what lies beyond the edges of the organisation (Bateson in Small arcs of larger circles: framing through other patterns, Triarchy Press, Axminster, 2018).",

    "abstract": "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been found to be useful to physicians in the field of image recognition due to three elements: deep learning (that is, CNN, convolutional neural network), a high-performance computer, and a large amount of digitized data. In the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy, Japanese endoscopists have produced the world's first achievements of CNN-based AI system for detecting gastric and esophageal cancers. This study reviews papers on CNN-based AI for gastrointestinal cancers, and discusses the future of this technology in clinical practice. Employing AI-based endoscopes would enable early cancer detection. The better diagnostic abilities of AI technology may be beneficial in early gastrointestinal cancers in which endoscopists have variable diagnostic abilities and accuracy. AI coupled with the expertise of endoscopists would increase the accuracy of endoscopic diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop an artificial intelligence tool to assess echocardiographic image quality objectively.\nLeft ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) has recently been used to monitor cancer therapeutics-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) but image quality limits its reliability.\nA DenseNet-121 convolutional neural network was developed for view identification from an athlete's echocardiographic dataset. To prove the concept that classification confidence (CC) can serve as a quality marker, values of longitudinal strain derived from feature tracking of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and strain analysis of echocardiography were compared. The CC was then applied to patients with breast cancer free from CTRCD to investigate the effects of image quality on the reliability of strain analysis.\nCC of the apical 4-chamber view (A4C) was significantly correlated with the endocardial border delineation index. CC of A4C >900 significantly predicted a\u00a0<15% relative difference in longitudinal strain between CMR feature tracking and automated echocardiographic analysis. Echocardiographic studies (n =752) of 102 patients with breast cancer without CTRCD were investigated. The strain analysis showed higher parallel forms, inter-rater, and test-retest reliabilities in patients with CC of A4C >900. During sequential comparisons of automated LVGLS in individual patients, those with CC of A4C >900 had a lower false positive detection rate of CTRCD.\nCC of A4C was associated with the reliability of automated LVGLS and could also potentially be used as a filter to select comparable images from sequential echocardiographic studies in individual patients and reduce the false\u00a0positive detection rate of CTRCD.",

    "abstract": "The aim is to evaluate whether smart worklist prioritization by artificial intelligence (AI) can optimize the radiology workflow and reduce report turnaround times (RTATs) for critical findings in chest radiographs (CXRs). Furthermore, we investigate a method to counteract the effect of false negative predictions by AI-resulting in an extremely and dangerously long RTAT, as CXRs are sorted to the end of the worklist.\nWe developed a simulation framework that models the current workflow at a university hospital by incorporating hospital-specific CXR generation rates and reporting rates and pathology distribution. Using this, we simulated the standard worklist processing \"first-in, first-out\" (FIFO) and compared it with a worklist prioritization based on urgency. Examination prioritization was performed by the AI, classifying eight different pathological findings ranked in descending order of urgency: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, infiltrate, congestion, atelectasis, cardiomegaly, mass, and foreign object. Furthermore, we introduced an upper limit for the maximum waiting time, after which the highest urgency is assigned to the examination.\nThe average RTAT for all critical findings was significantly reduced in all prioritization simulations compared to the FIFO simulation (e.g., pneumothorax: 35.6\u00a0min vs. 80.1\u00a0min; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), while the maximum RTAT for most findings increased at the same time (e.g., pneumothorax: 1293\u00a0min vs 890\u00a0min; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Our \"upper limit\" substantially reduced the maximum RTAT in all classes (e.g., pneumothorax: 979\u00a0min vs. 1293\u00a0min/1178\u00a0min; p\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nOur simulations demonstrate that smart worklist prioritization by AI can reduce the average RTAT for critical findings in CXRs while maintaining a small maximum RTAT as FIFO.\n\u2022 Development of a realistic clinical workflow simulator based on empirical data from a hospital allowed precise assessment of smart worklist prioritization using artificial intelligence. \u2022 Employing a smart worklist prioritization without a threshold for maximum waiting time runs the risk of false negative predictions of the artificial intelligence greatly increasing the report turnaround time. \u2022 Use of a state-of-the-art convolution neural network can reduce the average report turnaround time almost to the upper limit of a perfect classification algorithm (e.g., pneumothorax: 35.6\u00a0min vs. 30.4\u00a0min).",

We have performed a computational analysis of published literature to rank existing drugs according to predicted ability to reduce alpha synuclein (aSyn) oligomerization and analyzed real-world data to investigate the association between exposure to highly ranked drugs and PD.\nUsing IBM Watson for Drug Discovery\u00e2 (WDD) we identified several antihypertensive drugs that may reduce aSyn oligomerization. Using IBM MarketScan\u00e2 Research Databases we constructed a cohort of individuals with incident hypertension. We conducted univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses (HR) with exposure as a time-dependent covariate. Diuretics were used as the referent group. Age at hypertension diagnosis, sex, and several comorbidities were included in multivariate analyses.\nMultivariate results revealed inverse associations for time to PD diagnosis with exposure to the combination of the combination of angiotensin receptor II blockers (ARBs) and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (DHP-CCB) (HR = 0.55, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and diuretics (HR = 0.60, p-value <0.01). Increased risk was observed with exposure to alpha-blockers alone (HR = 1.81, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and the combination of alpha-blockers and CCB (HR = 3.17, p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nWe present evidence that a computational approach can efficiently identify leads for disease-modifying drugs.

    "abstract": "The low-cost 'THz Torch' wireless link technology is still in its infancy. Until very recently, inherent limitations with available hardware has resulted in a modest operational figure of merit performance (Range [Formula: see text] Bit Rate). However, a breakthrough was reported here by the authors, with the introduction of 'Cognitive Demodulation'. This bypassed the thermal time constant constraints normally associated with both the thermal emitter and sensor; allowing step-change increases in both Range and Bit Rate with direct electronic modulation. This paper concentrates on advancements to the bit error rate (BER) performance. Here, separate techniques are introduced to the demodulation software that, when combined, result in enhanced Cognitive Demodulation. A factor of more than 100 improvement in BER was demonstrated within the laboratory and approximately a 60-fold improvement in a non-laboratory environment; both at the maximum Range and Bit Rate of 2 m and 125 bps, respectively, demonstrated recently. Moreover, demodulation speed is increased by almost a factor of 10,000; allowing for real-time demodulation while easing future computational hardware requirements. In addition to these software advancements, the paper demonstrates important improvements in hardware that has brought the technology out of the laboratory, with field trials being performed within an office corridor.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful set of tools for engineering innovative materials. However, the AI-aided design of materials textures has not yet been researched in depth. In order to explore the potentials of AI for discovering innovative biointerfaces and engineering materials surfaces, especially for biomedical applications, this study focuses on the control of wettability through design-controlled hierarchical surfaces, whose design is supported and its performance predicted thanks to adequately structured and trained artificial neural networks (ANN). The authors explain the creation of a comprehensive library of microtextured surfaces with well-known wettability properties. Such a library is processed and employed for the generation and training of artificial neural networks, which can predict the actual wetting performance of new design biointerfaces. The present research demonstrates that AI can importantly support the engineering of innovative hierarchical or multiscale surfaces when complex-to-model properties and phenomena, such as wettability and wetting, are involved.",

    "abstract": "While coronary angiography is the gold standard diagnostic tool for coronary artery disease (CAD), but it is associated with procedural risk, it is an invasive technique requiring arterial puncture, and it subjects the patient to radiation and iodinated contrast exposure. Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a pretest probability of disease that can be used to triage patients for angiography. This review comprehensively investigates published papers in the domain of CAD detection using different AI techniques from 1991 to 2020, in order to discern broad trends and geographical differences. Moreover, key decision factors affecting CAD diagnosis are identified for different parts of the world by aggregating the results from different studies. In this study, all datasets that have been used for the studies for CAD detection, their properties, and achieved performances using various AI techniques, are presented, compared, and analyzed. In particular, the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to diagnose and predict CAD are reviewed. From PubMed, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, and Google Scholar search, 500 papers were selected to be investigated. Among these selected papers, 256 papers met our criteria and hence were included in this study. Our findings demonstrate that AI-based techniques have been increasingly applied for the detection of CAD since 2008. AI-based techniques that utilized electrocardiography (ECG), demographic characteristics, symptoms, physical examination findings, and heart rate signals, reported high accuracy for the detection of CAD. In these papers, the authors ranked the features based on their assessed clinical importance with ML techniques. The results demonstrate that the attribution of the relative importance of ML features for CAD diagnosis is different among countries. More recently, DL methods have yielded high CAD detection performance using ECG signals, which drives its burgeoning adoption.",

    "abstract": "To assess the relationship of smoking (cigarettes or waterpipe), alcohol drinking, alexithymia, self-esteem, anxiety, depression, stress, social phobia, emotional intelligence, impulsivity, insomnia, physical health, and loneliness with problematic social media use (PSMU) in a sample of Lebanese citizens.\nThis cross-sectional study enrolled 466 participants (January-May 2019).\nHigher anxiety, alcohol use disorder, and social phobia were correlated with elevated PSMU, while older age was associated with lower PSMU. Emotional intelligence partially mediated the association between alexithymia and PSMU by 4.55%.\nSince these manifestations are preventable, spreading awareness through our schools, educational programs, and even healthcare professionals would considerably reduce the pace at which young adults are transforming into anxious and distorted individuals.",

    "abstract": "Increased scrutiny of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare highlights the need for real-world evaluations for effectiveness and unintended consequences. The complexity of healthcare, compounded by the user- and context-dependent nature of AI applications, calls for a multifaceted approach beyond traditional in silico evaluation of AI. We propose an interdisciplinary, phased research framework for evaluation of AI implementations in healthcare. We draw analogies to and highlight differences from the clinical trial phases for drugs and medical devices, and we present study design and methodological guidance for each stage.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) can extract complex information from visual data. Histopathology images of gastrointestinal (GI) and liver cancer contain a very high amount of information which human observers can only partially make sense of. Complementing human observers, AI allows an in-depth analysis of digitised histological slides of GI and liver cancer and offers a wide range of clinically relevant applications. First, AI can automatically detect tumour tissue, easing the exponentially increasing workload on pathologists. In addition, and possibly exceeding pathologist's capacities, AI can capture prognostically relevant tissue features and thus predict clinical outcome across GI and liver cancer types. Finally, AI has demonstrated its capacity to infer molecular and genetic alterations of cancer tissues from histological digital slides. These are likely only the first of many AI applications that will have important clinical implications. Thus, pathologists and clinicians alike should be aware of the principles of AI-based pathology and its ability to solve clinically relevant problems, along with its limitations and biases.",

    "abstract": "Because the current Barrett's esophagus (BE) surveillance protocol suffers from sampling error of random biopsies and a high miss-rate of early neoplastic lesions, many new endoscopic imaging and sampling techniques have been developed. None of these techniques, however, have significantly increased the diagnostic yield of BE neoplasia. In fact, these techniques have led to an increase in the amount of visible information, yet endoscopists and pathologists inevitably suffer from variations in intra- and interobserver agreement. Artificial intelligence systems have the potential to overcome these endoscopist-dependent limitations.",

    "abstract": "Identification of emotions triggered by different sourced stimuli can be applied to automatic systems that help, relieve or protect vulnerable groups of population. The selection of the best stimuli allows to train these artificial intelligence-based systems in a more efficient and precise manner in order to discern different risky situations, characterized either by panic or fear emotions, in a clear and accurate way. The presented research study has produced a dataset of audiovisual stimuli (UC3M4Safety database) that triggers a complete range of emotions, with a high level of agreement and with a discrete emotional categorization, as well as quantitative categorization in the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance Affective space. This database is adequate for the machine learning algorithms contained in these automatic systems. Furthermore, this work analyses the effects of gender in the emotion elicitation under audiovisual stimuli, which can help to better design the final solution. Particularly, the focus is set on emotional responses to audiovisual stimuli reproducing situations experienced by women, such as gender-based violence. A statistical study of gender differences in emotional response was carried out on 1332 participants (811 women and 521 men). The average responses per video is around 84 (SD = 22). Data analysis was carried out with RStudio",

    "abstract": "The study of intelligence in humans has been ongoing for over 100 years, including the underlying structure, predictive validity, related cognitive measures, and source of differences. One of the key findings in intelligence research is the uniform positive correlations among cognitive tasks. This has been replicated with every cognitive test battery in humans. Nevertheless, many other aspects of intelligence research have revealed contradictory lines of evidence. Recently, cognitive test batteries have been developed for animals to examine similarities to humans in cognitive structure. The results are inconsistent, but there is evidence for some similarities. This article reviews the way intelligence and related cognitive abilities are assessed in humans and animals and suggests a different way of devising test batteries for maximizing between-species comparisons.

    "abstract": "In the course of the pandemic induced by the appearance of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we had to rethink the diagnostic approach for patients suffering from respiratory symptoms. Indeed, although the use of RT-PCR remains the keystone of the diagnosis, the delay in diagnosis as well as the overload of the microbiological platforms have led us to make almost systematic the use of thoracic imaging for taking in charge of patients. In this context, thoracic imaging has shown a major interest in diagnostic aid in order to better guide the management of patients admitted to hospital. The most common signs encountered are particularly well described in thoracic computed tomography. Typical imaging combines bilateral, predominantly peripheral and posterior, multi-lobar, ground glass opacities. Of note, it is common to identify significant lesions in asymptomatic patients, with imaging sometimes preceding the onset of symptoms. Beyond conventional chest imaging, many teams have developed new artificial intelligence tools to better help clinicians in decision-making.\nDans le d\u00e9cours de la pand\u00e9mie induite par l\u2019apparition d\u2019un nouveau coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019un syndrome de d\u00e9tresse respiratoire aigu (SDRA), nous avons d\u00fb repenser l\u2019approche diagnostique des patients souffrant de sympt\u00f4mes respiratoires. En effet, bien que l\u2019usage de la RT-PCR reste la cl\u00e9 de vo\u00fbte du diagnostic, le retard de diagnostic ainsi que la surcharge des plateformes microbiologiques nous ont men\u00e9s \u00e0 rendre quasi syst\u00e9matique l\u2019usage de l\u2019imagerie thoracique pour la prise en charge des patients. L\u2019imagerie thoracique a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, dans ce contexte, un int\u00e9r\u00eat majeur dans l\u2019aide au diagnostic afin d\u2019orienter, au mieux, la prise en charge des patients admis \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital. Les signes les plus couramment rencontr\u00e9s sont particuli\u00e8rement bien d\u00e9crits en tomodensitom\u00e9trie thoracique. L\u2019imagerie typique associe des l\u00e9sions en verre d\u00e9poli bilat\u00e9rales, multi-lobaires, \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique et post\u00e9rieure.

    "abstract": "Capsule endoscopy is ideally suited to artificial intelligence-based interpretation given its reliance on pattern recognition in still images. Time saving viewing modes and lesion detection features currently available rely on machine learning algorithms, a form of artificial intelligence. Current software necessitates close human supervision given poor sensitivity relative to an expert reader. However, with the advent of deep learning, artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly reliable and will be increasingly relied upon. We review the major advances in artificial intelligence for capsule endoscopy in recent publications and briefly review artificial intelligence development for historical understanding. Importantly, recent advancements in artificial intelligence have not yet been incorporated into practice and it is immature to judge the potential of this technology based on current platforms. Remaining regulatory and standardization hurdles are being overcome and artificial intelligence-based clinical applications are likely to proliferate rapidly.",

    "abstract": "Human sperm quality fluctuates over time. Therefore, it is crucial for couples preparing for natural pregnancy to monitor sperm motility.\nThis study verified the performance of an artificial intelligence-based image recognition and cloud computing sperm motility testing system (Bemaner, Createcare) composed of microscope and microfluidic modules and designed to adapt to different types of smartphones.\nSperm videos were captured and uploaded to the cloud with an app. Analysis of sperm motility was performed by an artificial intelligence-based image recognition algorithm then results were displayed. According to the number of motile sperm in the vision field, 47 (deidentified) videos of sperm were scored using 6 grades (0-5) by a male-fertility expert with 10 years of experience. Pearson product-moment correlation was calculated between the grades and the results (concentration of total sperm, concentration of motile sperm, and motility percentage) computed by the system.\nGood correlation was demonstrated between the grades and results computed by the system for concentration of total sperm (r=0.65, P<.001), concentration of motile sperm (r=0.84, P<.001), and motility percentage (r=0.90, P<.001).\nThis smartphone-based sperm motility test (Bemaner) accurately measures motility-related parameters and could potentially be applied toward the following fields: male infertility detection, sperm quality test during preparation for pregnancy, and infertility treatment monitoring. With frequent at-home testing, more data can be collected to help make clinical decisions and to conduct epidemiological research.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a sight-threatening condition that needs regular examinations and remedies. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the most common used examination to evaluate the structure and thickness of the macula, but the software in the OCT machine does not tell the clinicians whether DME exists directly. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to aid in diagnosis generation and therapy selection. We thus develop a smartphone-based offline AI system that provides diagnostic suggestions and medical strategies through analyzing OCT images from diabetic patients at the risk of developing DME.\nDME patients receiving treatments in 2017 at Taipei Veterans General Hospital were included in this study. We retrospectively collected the OCT images of these patients from January 2008 to July 2018. We established the AI model based on MobileNet architecture to classify the OCT images conditions. The confusion matrix has been applied to present the performance of the trained AI model.\nBased on the convolutional neural network with the MobileNet model, our AI system achieved a high DME diagnostic accuracy of 90.02%, which is comparable to other AI systems such as InceptionV3 and VGG16. We further developed a mobile-application based on this AI model available at https://aicl.ddns.net/DME.apk.\nWe successful integrated an AI model into the mobile device to provide an offline method to provide the diagnosis for quickly screening the risk of developing DME. With the offline property, our model could help those nonophthalmological healthcare providers in offshore islands or underdeveloped countries.",

    "abstract": "The electronic stethoscope combined with artificial intelligence (AI) technology has realized the digital acquisition of heart sounds and intelligent identification of congenital heart disease, which provides objective basis for heart sound auscultation and improves the accuracy of congenital heart disease diagnosis. At the present stage, the AI based cardiac auscultation technique mainly focuses on the research of AI algorithms, and the researchers have designed and summarized a variety of effective algorithms based on the characteristics of cardiac audio data, among which the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) is the most effective one, and widely used in the cardiac auscultation. However, the current cardiac sound analysis techniques are based on specific data sets, and have not been validated in clinic, so the performance of algorithms need to be further verified. The lack of heart sound data, especially the high-quality, standardized, publicly available heart sound database with disease labeling, further restricts the development of heart sound diagnostic analysis and its application in screening. Therefore, expert consensus is necessary in establishing an authoritative heart sound database and standardizing the heart sound auscultation screening process for congenital heart disease. This paper provides an overview of the research and application status of auscultation algorithm and hardware equipment based on AI in auscultation screening of congenital heart disease, and puts forward the problems to be solved in clinical application of AI auscultation screening technology.\n\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u542c\u8bca\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5fc3\u97f3\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u91c7\u96c6\u548c\u5148\u5929\u6027\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fc3\u97f3\u542c\u8bca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5ba2\u89c2\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5148\u5929\u6027\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u73b0\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u542c\u8bca\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u8981\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u56fd\u5185\u5916\u5b66\u8005\u4e5f\u9488\u5bf9\u5fc3\u97f3\u97f3\u9891\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6885\u5c14\u9891\u7387\u5012\u8c31\u7cfb\u6570\uff08MFCC\uff09\u662f\u6700\u5e38\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5fc3\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u542c\u8bca\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5fc3\u97f3\u667a\u80fd\u542c\u8bca\u6280\u672f\u5747\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5c1a\u672a\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5404\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u5f85\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5fc3\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u532e\u4e4f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u5e26\u75be\u75c5\u6807\u6ce8\u4e14\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u5fc3\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5236\u7ea6\u4e86\u5fc3\u97f3\u667a\u80fd\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u542c\u8bca\u7b5b\u67e5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u533b\u7597\u5355\u4f4d\u5e94\u5f53\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6709\u5173\u4e13\u5bb6\u5171\u540c\u5efa\u7acb\u5148\u5929\u6027\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u5fc3\u97f3\u542c\u8bca\u7b5b\u67e5\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5171\u8bc6\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5fc3\u97f3\u542c\u8bca\u7b5b\u67e5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u5efa\u7acb\u6743\u5a01\u5fc3\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5c31\u73b0\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u542c\u8bca\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u5907\u5728\u5148\u5929\u6027\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u542c\u8bca\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53ca\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5fc3\u97f3\u542c\u8bca\u7b5b\u67e5\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002",

    "abstract": "The concept of emotional intelligence has gained great popularity in the last few decades. With significant rise in stress and other emotional disturbances among students, it becomes necessary to determine whether high emotional intelligence could help manage perceived stress better. This study aims to assess emotional intelligence and perceived stress among undergraduate students of Arts and Science colleges, to determine the association of emotional intelligence with perceived stress, academic performance, and selected socio-demographic factors.\nUsing multistage sampling, 720 students aged 18 years and above were selected from four colleges in Puducherry. Emotional intelligence and perceived stress were assessed using standard self-administered questionnaires \"The Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SEIT)\" and \"Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14),\" respectively.\nThe median (IQR) Emotional Intelligence score and Perceived Stress score were 127 (114-137) and 43 (39-47), respectively. The study was not able to establish a significant association between emotional intelligence and perceived stress. A weak significant correlation existed between emotional intelligence and academic performance. Multiple variable analysis revealed gender, year of study, volunteering with youth organizations, and mother's occupation to be significantly associated with emotional intelligence (\nWomen, final year students and those who volunteered with youth organizations had higher emotional intelligence. Children of mothers who were employed in knowledge-intensive occupations were more emotionally intelligent. Academic performance had a weak positive significant correlation with emotional intelligence.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of whole slide imaging technology allows for pathology diagnosis on a computer screen. The applications of digital pathology are expanding, from supporting remote institutes suffering from a shortage of pathologists to routine use in daily diagnosis including that of lung cancer. Through practice and research large archival databases of digital pathology images have been developed that will facilitate the development of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for image analysis. Currently, several AI applications have been reported in the field of lung cancer; these include the segmentation of carcinoma foci, detection of lymph node metastasis, counting of tumor cells, and prediction of gene mutations. Although the integration of AI algorithms into clinical practice remains a significant challenge, we have implemented tumor cell count for genetic analysis, a helpful application for routine use. Our experience suggests that pathologists often overestimate the contents of tumor cells, and the use of AI-based analysis increases the accuracy and makes the tasks less tedious. However, there are several difficulties encountered in the practical use of AI in clinical diagnosis. These include the lack of sufficient annotated data for the development and validation of AI systems, the explainability of black box AI models, such as those based on deep learning that offer the most promising performance, and the difficulty in defining the ground truth data for training and validation owing to inherent ambiguity in most applications. All of these together present significant challenges in the development and clinical translation of AI methods in the practice of pathology. Additional research on these problems will help in resolving the barriers to the clinical use of AI. Helping pathologists in developing knowledge of the working and limitations of AI will benefit the use of AI in both diagnostics and research.",

    "abstract": "Vertebral fractures (VFs) cause serious problems, such as substantial functional loss and a high mortality rate, and a delayed diagnosis may further worsen the prognosis. Plain thoracolumbar radiography (PTLR) is an essential method for the evaluation of VFs. Therefore, minimizing the diagnostic errors of VFs on PTLR is crucial. Image identification based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) has been recognized to be potentially effective as a diagnostic strategy; however, the accuracy for detecting VFs has not been fully investigated. A DCNN was trained with PTLR images of 300 patients (150 patients with and 150 without VFs). The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of diagnosis of the model were calculated and compared with those of orthopedic residents, orthopedic surgeons, and spine surgeons. The DCNN achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates of 86.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 82.0-90.0%], 84.7% (95% CI 78.8-90.5%), and 87.3% (95% CI 81.9-92.7%), respectively. Both the accuracy and sensitivity of the model were suggested to be noninferior to those of orthopedic surgeons. The DCNN can assist clinicians in the early identification of VFs and in managing patients, to prevent further invasive interventions and a decreased quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Identifying pain generators in multilevel lumbar degenerative disc disease is not trivial but is crucial for lasting symptom relief with the targeted endoscopic spinal decompression surgery. Artificial intelligence (AI) applications of deep learning neural networks to the analysis of routine lumbar MRI scans could help the primary care and endoscopic specialist physician to compare the radiologist's report with a review of endoscopic clinical outcomes.\nTo analyze and compare the probability of predicting successful outcome with lumbar spinal endoscopy by using the radiologist's MRI grading and interpretation of the radiologic image with a novel AI deep learning neural network (Multus Radbot\u2122) as independent prognosticators.\nThe location and severity of foraminal stenosis were analyzed using comparative ordinal grading by the radiologist, and a contiguous grading by the AI network in patients suffering from lateral recess and foraminal stenosis due to lumbar herniated disc. The compressive pathology definitions were extracted from the radiologist lumbar MRI reports from 65 patients with a total of 383 levels for the central canal - (0) no disc bulge/protrusion/canal stenosis, (1) disc bulge without canal stenosis, (2) disc bulge resulting in canal stenosis, and (3) disc herniation/protrusion/extrusion resulting in canal stenosis. Both neural foramina were assessed with either - (0) neural foraminal stenosis absent, or (1) neural foramina are stenosis present. Reporting criteria for the pathologies at each disc level and, when available, the grading of severity were extracted and assigned into two categories: \"Normal,\" and \"Stenosis.\" Clinical outcomes were graded using dichotomized modified Macnab criteria considering \nThe average age of the 65 patients was 62.7 +/- 12.7 years. They consisted of 51 (54.3%) males and 43 (45.7%) females. At an average final follow-up of 57.4 +/- 12.57, Macnab outcome analysis showed that 86.4% of the 88 foraminal decompressions resulted in \nDeep learning algorithms are capable of identifying lumbar foraminal compression due to herniated disc. The treatment outcome was correlated to the decompression of the directly visualized corresponding pathology during the lumbar endoscopy. This research should be extended to other validated pain generators in the lumbar spine.\n3.\nValidity, clinical teaching, evaluation study.",

    "abstract": "The most common diagnoses after childhood sexual abuse are Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and depression. The aim of this study is to design a decision support system to help psychiatry physicians in the treatment of childhood sexual abuse. Computer aided decision support system (CADSS) based on ANN, which predicts the development of PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder, using different parameters of the act of abuse and patients was designed. The data of 149 girls and 21 boys who were victims of sexual abuse were included in the study. In the designed CADDS, the gender of the victim, the type of sexual abuse, the age of exposure, the duration until reporting, the time of abuse, the proximity of the abuser to the victim, number of sexual abuse, whether the child is exposed to threats and violence during the abuse, the person who reported the event, and the intelligence level of the victim are used as input parameters. The average accuracy values for all three designed systems were calculated as 99.2%. It has been shown that the system designed by using these data can be used safely in the psychiatric assessment process, in order to differentiate psychiatric diagnoses in the early post-abuse period.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory tests are considered an essential part of patient safety as patients' screening, diagnosis, and follow-up are solely based on laboratory tests. Diagnosis of patients could be wrong, missed, or delayed if laboratory tests are performed erroneously. However, recognizing the value of correct laboratory test ordering remains underestimated by policymakers and clinicians. Nowadays, artificial intelligence methods such as machine learning and deep learning (DL) have been extensively used as powerful tools for pattern recognition in large data sets. Therefore, developing an automated laboratory test recommendation tool using available data from electronic health records (EHRs) could support current clinical practice.\nThe objective of this study was to develop an artificial intelligence-based automated model that can provide laboratory tests recommendation based on simple variables available in EHRs.\nA retrospective analysis of the National Health Insurance database between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013, was performed. We reviewed the record of all patients who visited the cardiology department at least once and were prescribed laboratory tests. The data set was split into training and testing sets (80:20) to develop the DL model. In the internal validation, 25% of data were randomly selected from the training set to evaluate the performance of this model.\nWe used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, precision, recall, and hamming loss as comparative measures. A total of 129,938 prescriptions were used in our model. The DL-based automated recommendation system for laboratory tests achieved a significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCmacro and AUROCmicro of 0.76 and 0.87, respectively). Using a low cutoff, the model identified appropriate laboratory tests with 99% sensitivity.\nThe developed artificial intelligence model based on DL exhibited good discriminative capability for predicting laboratory tests using routinely collected EHR data. Utilization of DL approaches can facilitate optimal laboratory test selection for patients, which may in turn improve patient safety. However, future study is recommended to assess the cost-effectiveness for implementing this model in real-world clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "The so-called artificial intelligence tools applied to palliative care (machine learning, natural language processing) have great potential to support clinicians in improving decision-making processes and in identifying those who are at high risk of mortality or at greater risk of inappropriate treatment and/or non-positive outcomes. The improvement of prognostic abilities may help to avoid that some choices of patients with serious diseases are taken only in the last days of life, in the face of treatment options not previously discussed in an adequate and shared way. These tools can facilitate some essential aspects in the practice of palliative care, for example the activation of interviews that have as their objective the advance care planning and the definition of treatments consistent with the needs and desires of patients, especially in final stages of life. The development, also in our country, of projects for the application of artificial intelligence in palliative care requires particular attention to the possible organizational repercussions and to some ethical and relational aspects. It will be necessary to reflect on the most appropriate organizational models and on the specialized resources necessary in relation to the foreseeable increase in the number and variability of patients with early identified palliative care needs. These tools must not interfere in fundamental elements of the relationship between patient and doctor, that is the ability to communicate a poor prognosis in an individualized and ethically appropriate way.",

    "abstract": "The development and uptake of citizen science and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for ecological monitoring is increasing rapidly. Citizen science and AI allow scientists to create and process larger volumes of data than possible with conventional methods. However, managers of large ecological monitoring projects have little guidance on whether citizen science, AI, or both, best suit their resource capacity and objectives. To highlight the benefits of integrating the two techniques and guide future implementation by managers, we explore the opportunities, challenges, and complementarities of using citizen science and AI for ecological monitoring. We identify project attributes to consider when implementing these techniques and suggest that financial resources, engagement, participant training, technical expertise, and subject charisma and identification are important project considerations. Ultimately, we highlight that integration can supercharge outcomes for ecological monitoring, enhancing cost-efficiency, accuracy, and multi-sector engagement.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, COVID-19 is spreading at a rapid rate in almost all the continents of the world. It has already affected many people who are further spreading it day by day. Hence, it is the most essential to alert nearby people to be aware of it due to its communicable behavior. Till May 2020, no vaccine is available for the treatment of this COVID-19, but the existing technologies can be used to minimize its effect. Cloud/fog computing could be used to monitor and control this rapidly spreading infection in a cost-effective and time-saving manner. To strengthen COVID-19 patient prediction, Artificial Intelligence(AI) can be integrated with cloud/fog computing for practical solutions. In this paper, fog assisted the internet of things based quality of service framework is presented to prevent and protect from COVID-19. It provides real-time processing of users' health data to predict the COVID-19 infection by observing their symptoms and immediately generates an emergency alert, medical reports, and significant precautions to the user, their guardian as well as doctors/experts. It collects sensitive information from the hospitals/quarantine shelters through the patient IoT devices for taking necessary actions/decisions. Further, it generates an alert message to the government health agencies for controlling the outbreak of chronic illness and for tanking quick and timely actions.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and Machine Learning (ML)-based applications in particular, have the potential to change the scope of healthcare, including orthopaedic surgery.The greatest benefit of ML is in its ability to learn from real-world clinical use and experience, and thereby its capability to improve its own performance.Many successful applications are known in orthopaedics, but have yet to be adopted and evaluated for accuracy and efficacy in patients' care and doctors' workflows.The recent hype around AI triggered hope for development of better risk stratification tools to personalize orthopaedics in all subsequent steps of care, from diagnosis to treatment.Computer vision applications for fracture recognition show promising results to support decision-making, overcome bias, process high-volume workloads without fatigue, and hold the promise of even outperforming doctors in certain tasks.In the near future, AI-derived applications are very likely to assist orthopaedic surgeons rather than replace us. 'If the computer takes over the simple stuff, doctors will have more time again to practice the art of medicine'.",

    "abstract": "Among many possible variables that can be associated with gratitude, researchers list personality traits. Considering that these relationships are not always consistent, the first purpose of the present study was to verify how the Big Five factors connect to dispositional gratitude in a sample of Polish participants. The second purpose was to assess the unique contribution of personality traits on gratitude with multiple regression analyses. Moreover, because much remains to be learned about whether these associations are indirectly influenced by different personal or social variables, the third goal was to explore the role of emotional intelligence as a potential mediational mechanism implicated in the relationship between personality traits and gratitude.\nThe sample consisted of 712 Polish respondents who were aged between 17 and 88. Most of them were women (64.3%). They answered questionnaires concerning their personality traits, emotional intelligence, and gratitude. The research was conducted using the paper-and-pencil method through convenience sampling.\nThe results showed that both gratitude and emotional intelligence correlated positively and significantly with extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Gratitude and emotional intelligence correlated negatively and significantly with neuroticism. The personality predictor of gratitude with the highest and positive standardized regression value was agreeableness, followed by openness to experience and extraversion. Neuroticism had a negative impact on gratitude. Conscientiousness was the only statistically insignificant predictor in the tested multiple regression model. Moreover, emotional intelligence mediated the relationship between four dimensions of personality (extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) and gratitude and acted as a suppressor between neuroticism and gratitude.\nThe current study broadens our comprehension of the interaction among personality traits, emotional intelligence, and a grateful disposition. Moreover, it imparts a noteworthy foundation not only for the mediatory role of emotional intelligence between four dimensions of personality and gratitude but also for its suppressor effect between neuroticism and being grateful.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is a new member of the Coronaviridae family that has serious effects on respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. COVID-19 spreads quickly worldwide and affects more than 41.5 million persons (till 23 October 2020). It has a high hazard to the safety and health of people all over the world. COVID-19 has been declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, strict special policies and plans should be made to face this pandemic. Forecasting COVID-19 cases in hotspot regions is a critical issue, as it helps the policymakers to develop their future plans. In this paper, we propose a new short term forecasting model using an enhanced version of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). An improved marine predators algorithm (MPA), called chaotic MPA (CMPA), is applied to enhance the ANFIS and to avoid its shortcomings. More so, we compared the proposed CMPA with three artificial intelligence-based models include the original ANFIS, and two modified versions of ANFIS model using both of the original marine predators algorithm (MPA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The forecasting accuracy of the models was compared using different statistical assessment criteria. CMPA significantly outperformed all other investigated models.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology has improved diagnostic performance and shortened reading times of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients' studies.\nThe objectives pf the study were to analyze the performance of a chest computed tomography (CT) AI quantitative algorithm for determining the risk of mortality/mechanical ventilation (MV) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and explore a prognostic multivariate model in a tertiary-care center in Mexico City.\nChest CT images of 166 COVID-19 patients hospitalized from April 1 to 20, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed using AI algorithm software. Data were collected from their medical records. We analyzed the diagnostic yield of the relevant CT variables using the area under the ROC curve (area under the curve [AUC]). Optimal thresholds were obtained using the Youden index. We proposed a predictive logistic model for each outcome based on CT AI measures and predetermined laboratory and clinical characteristics.\nThe highest diagnostic yield of the assessed CT variables for mortality was the percentage of total opacity (threshold >51%; AUC = 0.88, sensitivity = 74%, and specificity = 91%). The AUC of the CT severity score (threshold > 12.5) was 0.88 for MV (sensitivity = 65% and specificity = 92%). The proposed prognostic models include the percentage of opacity and lactate dehydrogenase level for mortality and troponin I and CT severity score for MV requirement.\nThe AI-calculated CT severity score and total opacity percentage showed good diagnostic accuracy for mortality and met MV criteria. The proposed prognostic models using biochemical variables and imaging data measured by AI on chest CT showed good risk classification in our population of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "To develop a deep learning model to automatically segment hepatocystic anatomy and assess the criteria defining the critical view of safety (CVS) in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC).\nPoor implementation and subjective interpretation of CVS contributes to the stable rates of bile duct injuries in LC. As CVS is assessed visually, this task can be automated by using computer vision, an area of artificial intelligence aimed at interpreting images.\nStill images from LC videos were annotated with CVS criteria and hepatocystic anatomy segmentation. A deep neural network comprising a segmentation model to highlight hepatocystic anatomy and a classification model to predict CVS criteria achievement was trained and tested using 5-fold cross validation. Intersection over union, average precision, and balanced accuracy were computed to evaluate the model performance versus the annotated ground truth.\nA total of 2854 images from 201 LC videos were annotated and 402 images were further segmented. Mean intersection over union for segmentation was 66.6%. The model assessed the achievement of CVS criteria with a mean average precision and balanced accuracy of 71.9% and 71.4%, respectively.\nDeep learning algorithms can be trained to reliably segment hepatocystic anatomy and assess CVS criteria in still laparoscopic images. Surgical-technical partnerships should be encouraged to develop and evaluate deep learning models to improve surgical safety.",

    "abstract": "Residential greenness has been reported to be positively associated with health benefits for children, including improved cognitive function. We investigated the association between the intelligence quotient (IQ) of 6-year-old children in Seoul, South Korea and surrounding greenness currently and during the mothers' pregnancy. We also analyzed whether these effects differed by the type of greenness, such as natural or built greenness.\nThis study considered 189 mother-child dyads from the Environment and Development of Children Cohort study, who lived in Seoul during the prenatal period and when the child was 6\u00a0years old. We defined surrounding greenness using Landsat image data from Korean Arirang satellite images with buffers within 100\u00a0m - 2000\u00a0m of the radius of each participant's residential address. We separately analyzed two types of greenness, namely natural and built greenness. The children's IQ (total, verbal, and performance IQ) was measured using the Korean Educational Developmental Institute's Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.\nPrenatal exposure to built greenness in 500\u00a0m and 1000\u00a0m buffers was associated with children's total IQ in a full model [difference in IQ (95% CI): 3.46(0.68, 6.24) and 3.42 (0.53, 6.31) per interquartile increase in proportion of greenness]. However, postnatal exposure to built greenness in all buffers was associated in children's total IQ. We found a stronger association between children's total IQ and built greenness rather than natural greenness.\nWe found that 6-year-old children tended to score higher on total IQ if they lived in greener neighborhoods. The results provide further evidence of the health benefits of greenness and provide support for urban planning and public health to build healthy urban cities for children and pregnant women.",

However, postnatal exposure to built greenness in all buffers was associated in children's total IQ. We found a stronger association between children's total IQ and built greenness rather than natural greenness.",

    "abstract": "Through the big data intelligent algorithm and application of artificial intelligence in critically ill patients, the value of the combination of clinical real-time warning and artificial intelligence in critical care medicine was explored. Artificial intelligence was used to simulate human thinking by studying, calculating, and analyzing a large amount of critical illness data in the medical work, and integrate a large number of clinical monitoring and treatment data generated in critical care medicine. The necessity, feasibility, relevance, data learning and application architecture of the application of artificial intelligence in the early warning of critical illness in medical work were analyzed, thus to promote the pioneering application of real-time warning of critical illness in clinical medicine. The development of critical care medicine in medical work requires the integration of big data and artificial intelligence. Through real-time early warning, accurate and scientific intelligent application of medical data, the life threatening uncertainties in the diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients can be more effectively reduced and the success rate of the treatment of critically ill patients can be improved. The perfect combination of artificial intelligence technology and big data of critical care medicine can provide a favorable guarantee for the pioneering application of real-time warning of critical care medicine in clinical work.",
