Learn Generative AI

Generative AI can help boost your productivity if used correctly.

AI prompt engineering is one of the hottest jobs in tech.

Knowing how to write prompts correctly is the key to helping you use generative AIs.

Learning by Doing

In these tutorials, you get step-by-step guides on how to write AI prompts to get the best possible results from text-to-text and text-to-image generative AIs.

You will learn to understand Generative AI capabilities and write prompts that minimize misinformation and biased results.

You will learn how to preface your prompts and add details to them to generate consistent results.
Learning by Examples

In these tutorials, we will use examples to better explain the various concepts.
Example

With the following prompt:
Explain "Generative AI" like I'm 5 years old

A response from a Generative AI (in this case, ChatGPT) could be:

What is AI?

When talking about Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the tech industry, we refer to intelligent machines that can do jobs that previously needed human intelligence.

Advances in machine learning have given AI a huge boost.

This tutorial focuses on Generative AI, like text-to-text and text-to-image.

What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is an AI that can create something like:

    * Text
    * Images
    * Audio
    * Videos
    * 3D models

Generative AIs analyze and use existing data and input from a user to generate these things.

Giving Generative AIs input is known as AI Prompt Writing or AI Prompt Engineering.
What is AI Prompt Writing?

AI Prompt Writing (or Engineering) is the process of creating input (usually text) instructing the Generative AI to generate the desired response.

In other words, prompting is the way we ask an AI to do something.

A prompt should be tailored to the type of response you want to receive and to the specifics of the Generative AI you use.

Different types of prompts:

    * Instructions
    * Questions
    * Data
    * Examples


What is text-to-text Generative AI?

A text-to-text Generative AI is an AI that Generates text based on text input.

An example of a text-to-text Generative AI is ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI.

Text generation uses machine learning, existing data and previous user input in generating responses.

Text Generative AI can be used to:

    Understanding Text
    Create content
    Debug code
    Education
    Research
    Translation
    Virtual Assistant
    And much, much more!

Giving Generative AIs input is known as AI Prompt Writing or AI Prompt Engineering.
General Rules for Prompt Writing

When writing prompts for text-to-text Generative AIs, the rules will differ depending on which platform you use, but here are some general rules:

    Start simple - start with a simple prompt and build on it
    Call to Action - start the prompt with an action word like "Write", "Create", or "Summarize" instead of "Can you"
    Add Context - add specific and relevant context to the task you want to perform
    Add Expectations - add clear and direct expectations for the content, like how long it should be and what to include

Example

With the following prompt:
Create a list of 10 fun and inexpensive toy gifts to programmers based on the following criteria:

- It should be useful
- It should be silly
- It should spark creativity

A response from a Generative AI (in this case, ChatGPT) could be:
