    "abstract": "The field of nanomedicine has made substantial strides in the areas of therapeutic and diagnostic development. For example, nanoparticle-modified drug compounds and imaging agents have resulted in markedly enhanced treatment outcomes and contrast efficiency. In recent years, investigational nanomedicine platforms have also been taken into the clinic, with regulatory approval for Abraxane\u00ae and other products being awarded. As the nanomedicine field has continued to evolve, multifunctional approaches have been explored to simultaneously integrate therapeutic and diagnostic agents onto a single particle, or deliver multiple nanomedicine-functionalized therapies in unison. Similar to the objectives of conventional combination therapy, these strategies may further improve treatment outcomes through targeted, multi-agent delivery that preserves drug synergy. Also, similar to conventional/unmodified combination therapy, nanomedicine-based drug delivery is often explored at fixed doses. A persistent challenge in all forms of drug administration is that drug synergy is time-dependent, dose-dependent and patient-specific at any given point of treatment. To overcome this challenge, the evolution towards nanomedicine-mediated co-delivery of multiple therapies has made the potential of interfacing artificial intelligence (AI) with nanomedicine to sustain optimization in combinatorial nanotherapy a reality. Specifically, optimizing drug and dose parameters in combinatorial nanomedicine administration is a specific area where AI can actionably realize the full potential of nanomedicine. To this end, this review will examine the role that AI can have in substantially improving nanomedicine-based treatment outcomes, particularly in the context of combination nanotherapy for both N-of-1 and population-optimized treatment.",

    "abstract": "Mining social media data for studying the human condition has created new and unique challenges. When analyzing social media data from marginalized communities, algorithms lack the ability to accurately interpret off-line context, which may lead to dangerous assumptions about and implications for marginalized communities. To combat this challenge, we hired formerly gang-involved young people as domain experts for contextualizing social media data in order to create inclusive, community-informed algorithms. Utilizing data from the Gang Intervention and Computer Science Project-a comprehensive analysis of Twitter data from gang-involved youth in Chicago-we describe the process of involving formerly gang-involved young people in developing a new part-of-speech tagger and content classifier for a prototype natural language processing system that detects aggression and loss in Twitter data. We argue that involving young people as domain experts leads to more robust understandings of context, including localized language, culture, and events. These insights could change how data scientists approach the development of corpora and algorithms that affect people in marginalized communities and who to involve in that process. We offer a contextually driven interdisciplinary approach between social work and data science that integrates domain insights into the training of qualitative annotators and the production of algorithms for positive social impact.",

    "abstract": "Remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) are in frequent use by the U.S. Air Force to engage in combat operations from remote locations. RPA operations involve remote killing, which can lead to significant emotional responses. This study addresses a gap in research by examining the association of existential and spiritual health with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in RPA and intelligence personnel.\nThree hundred and five U.S. Air Force RPA and intelligence personnel completed the Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS) and PTSD Checklist-Military Version. Correlational analyses were used to examine the association between SWBS score and PTSD symptoms.\nThere was a negative correlation between the SWBS and PTSD Checklist-Military Version scores (Pearson correlation coefficient = -0.49, p < 0.0001). Higher spiritual and existential well-being were associated with lower PTSD symptoms. Further, spiritual and existential scores in this sample were comparable with a number of SWBS norms, suggesting that levels of existential distress may not be high among remote warfare operators.\nIn this sample of U.S. Air Force personnel involved in remote warfare, higher spiritual and existential well-being were associated with less endorsement of mental health symptoms on a PTSD symptom measure. Additionally, levels of spiritual and existential well-being in this sample were comparable with norms used in a number of samples within the general population. Although there are ongoing concerns regarding the psychological impact remote warfare has on RPA operators, the bulk of current research has indicated that operational stressors such as workload, rotating shifts, organizational and leadership concerns, and balancing work and domestic tasks rather than the job duties themselves (i.e., involvement in killing) likely contribute more to reported emotional distress levels.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the outcomes that an interview-based medical school admission process has on academic performance, psychological health, personality traits, and emotional intelligence.\nA comparative cross-sectional study was conducted on the interviewed and non-interviewed cohorts. Their examination marks were obtained from the academic office, psychological health was measured by DASS-21, personality traits were measured by USMaP-15, and emotional intelligence was measured by USMEQ-17.\nThe interviewed cohort performed significantly better in the clinical examination than the non-interviewed cohort. Conversely, the non-interviewed cohort performed significantly better in the theoretical examination. Depression, anxiety, and stress level between the two cohorts showed no difference. The interviewed cohort demonstrated more desirable personality traits, higher emotional intelligence, and social competence than the non-interviewed cohort.\nThis study provides evidence to support the claim that the interview-based admission process has favourable outcomes on clinical performance, emotional intelligence, and personality traits.

Theory, methods, and models from artificial intelligence (AI) are changing the health care landscape in clinical and community settings and have already shown promising results in multiple applications in healthcare including, integrated health information systems, patient education, geocoding health data, social media analytics, epidemic and syndromic surveillance, predictive modeling and decision support, mobile health, and medical imaging (e.g. radiology and retinal image analyses). Health intelligence uses tools and methods from artificial intelligence and data science to provide better insights, reduce waste and wait time, and increase speed, service efficiencies, level of accuracy, and productivity in health care and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Personality and intelligence have a long history in applied psychology, with research dating back more than 100 years. In line, early developments in industrial-organizational psychology were largely founded on the predictive power of personality and intelligence measures vis-\u00e0-vis career-related outcomes. However, despite a wealth of evidence in support of their utility, the concepts, theories, and measures of personality and intelligence are still widely underutilized in organizations, even when these express a commitment to making data-driven decisions about employees and leaders. This paper discusses the value of personality and intelligence to understand individual differences in career potential, and how to increase the adoption of theories and tools for evaluating personality and intelligence in real-world organizational contexts. Although personality and intelligence are distinct constructs, the assessment of career potential is incomplete without both.",

    "abstract": "In this article I suggest why a symposium is desirable on the topic of why, despite worldwide increases in IQ since the beginning of the 20th century, there are so many unresolved and dramatic problems in the world. I briefly discuss what some of these problems are, and the paradox of people with higher IQs not only being unable to solve them, but in some cases people being unwilling to address them. I suggest that higher IQ is not always highly relevant to the problems, and in some cases, may displace other skills that better would apply to the solution of the problems. I present a limited-resource model as an adjunct to the augmented theory of successful intelligence. The model suggests that increasing societal emphases on analytical abilities have displaced development and utilization of other skills, especially creative, practical, and wisdom-based ones, that better could be applied to serious world problems. I also discuss the importance of cognitive inoculation against unscrupulous and sometimes malevolent attempts to change belief systems.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models of cognition measure individual differences in cognitive processes, such as processing speed, working memory capacity, and executive functions, that may underlie general intelligence. As such, cognitive models allow identifying associations between specific cognitive processes and tracking the effect of experimental interventions aimed at the enhancement of intelligence on mediating process parameters. Moreover, cognitive models provide an explicit theoretical formalization of theories regarding specific cognitive processes that may help in overcoming ambiguities in the interpretation of fuzzy verbal theories. In this paper, we give an overview of the advantages of cognitive modeling in intelligence research and present models in the domains of processing speed, working memory, and selective attention that may be of particular interest for intelligence research. Moreover, we provide guidelines for the application of cognitive models in intelligence research, including data collection, the evaluation of model fit, and statistical analyses.",

    "abstract": "Here we analyze the simultaneous relationships among five variables. Two refer to childhood (episodes of various forms of maltreatment and externalizing behaviors), whereas three refer to early adulthood (intelligence, personality, and socialization difficulties). The 120 individuals considered for the present report were invited from the 650 schoolchildren participating in the Longitudinal Study of Intelligence and Personality (Minas Gerais, Brazil). The complete sample was recruited in 2002 (T1; mean age = 10.0; standard deviation (SD) = 2.2) and 120 were tested again in 2014-17 (T2; mean age = 23.5; SD = 2.2). Externalizing behaviors were registered at T1, whereas the remaining variables were obtained at T2. These were the main results: (1) externalizing behaviors predict future social effectiveness (as estimated by the general factor of personality derived from the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R) and socialization difficulties computed from the socialization scale (SOC)) and future intelligence performance (as assessed by a set of fluid and crystallized tests); (2) episodes of self-reported childhood maltreatment predict social effectiveness, but not intelligence; (3) maltreatment and externalizing behaviors are unrelated; and (4) social effectiveness (personality) and intelligence are unrelated. Therefore, the findings support the dissociation between adult intelligence and personality with respect to maltreatment episodes and externalizing behaviors occurring in childhood. Implications of these findings for social policies aimed at preventing adult socially ineffective personalities are underscored.",

    "abstract": "The correlations between the measures of cognitive abilities and personality traits are known to be low. Our data based on the popular Big Five model of intelligence show that the highest correlations (up to r = 0.30) tend to occur with the Openness to Experience. Some recent developments in the studies of intelligence (e.g., emotional intelligence, complex problem solving and economic games) indicate that this link may become stronger in future. Furthermore, our studies of the processes in the \"no-man's-land\" between intelligence and personality suggest that the non-cognitive constructs are correlated with both. These include the measures of social conservatism and self-beliefs. Importantly, the Big Five measures do not tap into either the dark traits associated with social conservatism or self-beliefs that are known to be good predictors of academic achievement. This paper argues that the personality domain should be broadened to include new constructs that have not been captured by the lexical approach employed in the development of the Big Five model. Furthermore, since the measures of confidence have the highest correlation with cognitive performance, we suggest that the trait of confidence may be a driver that leads to the separation of fluid and crystallized intelligence during development.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment can complicate minor stroke, but there is limited information on risk factors including peak cognitive ability earlier in life.\nWe recruited patients with clinically-evident lacunar or minor non-lacunar ischaemic stroke, recorded clinical features, vascular risk factors, magnetic resonance imaging-detected stroke sub-type and small vessel disease burden. At 1-3 and 12 months after stroke, we assessed educational attainment (years of education), current cognition (Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised), pre-morbid intelligence (National Adult Reading Test) and dependency (modified Rankin Scale).\nWe recruited 157 patients (87 lacunar, 64 non-lacunar ischaemic strokes), median age 66 (inter-quartile range 56-74) years, 36/157 (23%) patients had a Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised score\u2009<\u200982 at one to three months, 29/151 (19%) had a Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised\u2009<\u200982 at one year. Lower National Adult Reading Test score (cognitive impairment per point on National Adult Reading Test odds ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.87, 0.95) and older age (per year of age odds ratio 1.04 (95% confidence interval 1.01, 1.08) predicted one-year cognitive impairment more than stroke severity (per point on National Institute of Health Stroke Scale odds ratio 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.0.68, 1.31)) or vascular risk factors e.g. hypertension (odds ratio for diagnosis of hypertension 0.52 (95% confidence interval 0.24, 1.15). Cognitive impairment was associated with having more white matter hyper-intensities (odds ratio per point increase in Fazekas score 1.42, 95% confidence interval 1.11, 1.83).\nThis observational study provides evidence that pre-morbid intelligence quotient and education predict cognition after stroke, and confirms the association between cognitive impairment and small vessel disease.\nPre-morbid intelligence should be considered in future studies of post-stroke cognition.",

    "abstract": "Nursing is a stressful occupation, and nurses face multiple stressors daily. Emotional intelligence causes an individual to overcome environmental stresses. The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between emotional intelligence and job stress among nurses in Shiraz.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted with 500 nurses, selected through multistage cluster sampling, from the hospitals in Shiraz in 2017. The data collection tools were the Siberia Schering's Emotional Intelligence Standard Questionnaire and the Hospital Job Stress Standard Questionnaire, completed through the self-report method. The data were analysed using SPSS 22 software.\nThe mean scores of emotional intelligence and job stress were 113.59 \u00b1 14.70 (total score = 165) and 97.10 \u00b1 14.27 (total score = 175), respectively. The correlation test showed that there was an inverse relationship between emotional intelligence and job stress (\nRegarding the relatively strong and inverse relationship between the nurses' emotional intelligence and job stress, it is suggested that emotional intelligence workshops be included in the in-service training programs of the nurses.",

    "abstract": "Preconceived ideas about artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence (AI) has made considerable progress in many tasks or activities that involve a large number of jobs and sectors. She is thus the subject of many fantasies and fears. People could see AI as a machine as intelligent as a human, self-aware and able to make choices with automony. However, this representation is very far from reality. Existing AI systems are not about to be endowed with a consciousness and capable of thinking for themselves. It is true that there are many AI tools available on the healthcare market and the scope of their current applications in the field of medical diagnosis seems impressive. But overall, promises remain uncertain at this stage. The scenario of a medicine without doctors, of brutal destruction of the health professions, is today more of a buzz and a media frenzy than a science. One way to understand this media excitement would be to ask why AI and health \u00abgo well together\u00bb? What is the reality of AI today and what are its strong limitations? The objective of this article is not to affirm that AI is a non-subject, quite the contrary, but to make people aware that the future of the health system will be the one we want to promote for the future.\nId\u00e9es pr\u00e9con\u00e7ues \u00e0 propos de l\u2019intelligence artificielle. L\u2019intelligence artificielle a fait des progr\u00e8s consid\u00e9rables dans la prise en charge de nombreuses t\u00e2ches ou activit\u00e9s qui concernent un grand nombre de m\u00e9tiers et de secteurs d\u2019activit\u00e9. Elle fait ainsi l\u2019objet de beaucoup de fantasmes et de crainte. Le grand public s\u2019imagine l\u2019intelligence artificielle comme une machine aussi intelligente qu\u2019un humain, qui a conscience d\u2019elle-m\u00eame et qui peut faire des choix en toute autonomie. Cette repr\u00e9sentation est pourtant tr\u00e8s loin de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Les dispositifs existants ne sont pas pr\u00e8s d\u2019\u00eatre dot\u00e9s d\u2019une conscience et capables de penser par eux-m\u00eames. Il est vrai qu\u2019il existe de nombreux outils d\u2019intelligence artificielle sur le march\u00e9 de la sant\u00e9, et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de leurs applications actuelles dans le domaine du diagnostic m\u00e9dical para\u00eet impressionnante (oncologie, cardiologie, ophtalmologie, radiologie, sant\u00e9 mentale, d\u00e9tection de maladies rares\u2026). Mais, globalement, les promesses restent encore incertaines au stade actuel. Le sc\u00e9nario d\u2019une m\u00e9decine sans m\u00e9decins, de destructions brutales des m\u00e9tiers de la sant\u00e9, rel\u00e8ve aujourd\u2019hui plus du buzz et de l\u2019emballement m\u00e9diatique que de la science. Une mani\u00e8re de comprendre cet emballement m\u00e9diatique serait de se demander pourquoi l\u2019intelligence artificielle et la sant\u00e9 \u00ab vont bien ensemble \u00bb. Quelle est la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de l\u2019intelligence artificielle aujourd\u2019hui et quelles en sont ses limites fortes ? L\u2019objectif de cet article n\u2019est pas d\u2019affirmer que l\u2019intelligence artificielle est un non-sujet, bien au contraire, mais de faire prendre conscience que l\u2019avenir du syst\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais sera celui que l\u2019on souhaite promouvoir demain.",

    "abstract": "Fluid volume and blood pressure (BP) management are crucial endpoints for end-stage kidney disease patients. BP control in clinical practice mainly relies on reducing extracellular fluid volume overload by diminishing targeted postdialysis weight. This approach exposes dialysis patients to intradialytic hypotensive episodes.\nBoth chronic hypertension and intradialytic hypotension lead to adverse long-term outcomes. Achieving the optimal trade-off between adequate fluid removal and the risk of intradialytic adverse events is a complex task in clinical practice given the multiple patient-related and dialysis-related factors affecting the hemodynamic response to treatment. State-of-the-art artificial intelligence has been adopted in other complex decision-making tasks for dialysis patients and may help personalize the multiple dialysis-related prescriptions affecting patients' intradialytic hemodynamics. As a proof of concept, we developed a multiple-endpoint model predicting session-specific Kt/V, fluid volume removal, heart rate, and BP based on patient characteristics, historic hemodynamic responses, and dialysis-related prescriptions.\nThe accuracy and precision of this preliminary model is extremely encouraging. Such analytic tools may be used to anticipate patients' reactions through simulation so that the best strategy can be chosen based on clinical judgment or formal utility functions.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated that victims of bullying report serious problems, such as depression, which heighten the risk of suicide. Emotional intelligence (EI) has been increasingly recognized as a protective factor, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying the relation between EI and suicide risk in victims. This study aimed to test a theoretical model of how EI, depressive symptoms and gender interact to influence suicidal ideation and attempts in a sample of Spanish victims of bullying.\nThe sample comprised 465 victims (273 girls) who completed self-report measures of perceived EI, depression and suicide risk.\nMediation and moderation analyses were performed using conditional process analysis. Findings showed that EI is a predictor of decreased suicide in victims. This relationship was partially mediated by depressive symptoms. Furthermore, this effect was moderated by gender, such that the mediation effect was stronger in girls compared to boys (moderated mediation).\nThe cross-sectional design and the use of self-report instruments. Future research should address the longitudinal relations of these findings.\nThe promotion of emotional skills could be core to the development of suicide prevention programs in those high-risk adolescents who have suffered from bullying. Furthermore, gender should be taken into consideration, especially with regard to females reporting depressive symptoms related to having been bullied.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a theoretical framework for the biological learning mechanism as a general learning system. The proposal is as follows. The bursting and tonic modes of firing patterns found in many neuron types in the brain correspond to two separate modes of information processing, with one mode resulting in awareness, and another mode being subliminal. In such a coding scheme, a neuron in bursting state codes for the highest level of perceptual abstraction representing a pattern of sensory stimuli, or volitional abstraction representing a pattern of muscle contraction sequences. Within the 50-250\u202fms minimum integration time of experience, the bursting neurons form synchrony ensembles to allow for binding of related percepts. The degree which different bursting neurons can be merged into the same synchrony ensemble depends on the underlying cortical connections that represent the degree of perceptual similarity. These synchrony ensembles compete for selective attention to remain active. The dominant synchrony ensemble triggers episodic memory recall in the hippocampus, while forming new episodic memory with current sensory stimuli, resulting in a stream of thoughts. Neuromodulation modulates both top-down selection of synchrony ensembles, and memory formation. Episodic memory stored in the hippocampus is transferred to semantic and procedural memory in the cortex during rapid eye movement sleep, by updating cortical neuron synaptic weights with spike timing dependent plasticity. With the update of synaptic weights, new neurons become bursting while previous bursting neurons become tonic, allowing bursting neurons to move up to a higher level of perceptual abstraction. Finally, the proposed learning mechanism is compared with the back-propagation algorithm used in deep neural networks, and a proposal of how the credit assignment problem can be addressed by the current theory is presented.",

    "abstract": "Using M-Rex, a rugby scrum simulator, we developed tools to describe scrummaging forces and to prevent accident.\nWe tested three groups of frontliners at national level. The simulator was passive or responded to the player(s) to simulate the reaction of opposite players. Sensors in the beam measured the force exerted by each of the players. Their movements were recorded with a Codamotion system.\nThe force signals exhibited two phases: a transient phase, similar to a damped sinusoid with a dominant frequency around 5 Hz when the players scrummaged alone and with a wider range when playing together; then, a sustained phase could be decomposed in two components: a DC component remained stable whether frontliners played alone or together. In contrast, its variability decreased when the frontliners played together compared with when they played alone. As for the oscillations, the frontliners exhibited a large variability in their ability to synchronise their efforts during the sustained phase. The synchronisation between the hooker and the props was quite efficient, while it was always missing between two props. Finally, we were able to study postural readjustments and their synchronisation among players during the sustained phase.\nThis study shows that by using adequate methods, it is possible to assess the frontline collective intelligence. These findings may pave the way for innovative methods of training to improve players' collective behaviour.",

    "results": "The force signals exhibited two phases: a transient phase, similar to a damped sinusoid with a dominant frequency around 5 Hz when the players scrummaged alone and with a wider range when playing together; then, a sustained phase could be decomposed in two components: a DC component remained stable whether frontliners played alone or together. In contrast, its variability decreased when the frontliners played together compared with when they played alone. As for the oscillations, the frontliners exhibited a large variability in their ability to synchronise their efforts during the sustained phase. The synchronisation between the hooker and the props was quite efficient, while it was always missing between two props. Finally, we were able to study postural readjustments and their synchronisation among players during the sustained phase.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and psychological wellbeing in a three-month follow-up study of male athletes. In addition, we examined the mediating role of perceived social support and perceived stress on the relationship between EI and psychological wellbeing. The sample included 398 male athletes who completed measures of emotional intelligence (Schutte Self-Report Inventory), psychological wellbeing (Ryff Psychological Wellbeing Scale; SSRI), perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support), and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10). Results from structural equation modelling procedures identified that perceived social support and perceived stress partially mediated the association between EI and psychological wellbeing. The sequential mediation effects of perceived social support-perceived stress on the relations between EI and wellbeing were confirmed. Finally, limitations and recommendations for future research were considered.",

    "abstract": "How the neocortex works is a mystery. In this paper we propose a novel framework for understanding its function. Grid cells are neurons in the entorhinal cortex that represent the location of an animal in its environment. Recent evidence suggests that grid cell-like neurons may also be present in the neocortex. We propose that grid cells exist throughout the neocortex, in every region and in every cortical column. They define a location-based framework for how the neocortex functions. Whereas grid cells in the entorhinal cortex represent the location of one thing, the body relative to its environment, we propose that cortical grid cells simultaneously represent the location of many things. Cortical columns in somatosensory cortex track the location of tactile features relative to the object being touched and cortical columns in visual cortex track the location of visual features relative to the object being viewed. We propose that mechanisms in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus that evolved for learning the structure of environments are now used by the neocortex to learn the structure of objects. Having a representation of location in each cortical column suggests mechanisms for how the neocortex represents object compositionality and object behaviors. It leads to the hypothesis that every part of the neocortex learns complete models of objects and that there are many models of each object distributed throughout the neocortex. The similarity of circuitry observed in all cortical regions is strong evidence that even high-level cognitive tasks are learned and represented in a location-based framework.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), beyond the concrete applications that have already become part of our daily lives, makes it possible to process numerous and heterogeneous data and knowledge, and to understand potentially complex and abstract rules in a manner human intelligence can but without human intervention. AI combines two properties, self-learning by the successive and repetitive processing of data as well as the capacity to adapt, that is to say the possibility for a scripted program to deal with multiple situations likely to vary over time. Roundtable experts confirmed the potential contribution and theoretical benefit of AI in clinical research and in improving the efficiency of patient care. Experts also measured, as is the case for any new process that people need to get accustomed to, its impact on practices and mindset. To maximize the benefits of AI, four critical points have been identified. The careful consideration of these four points conditions the technical integration and the appropriation by all actors of the life science spectrum: researchers, regulators, drug developers, care establishments, medical practitioners and, above all, patients and the civil society. 1st critical point: produce tangible demonstrations of the contributions of AI in clinical research by quantifying its benefits. 2nd critical point: build trust to foster dissemination and acceptability of AI in healthcare thanks to an adapted regulatory framework. 3rd critical point: ensure the availability of technical skills, which implies an investment in training, the attractiveness of the health sector relative to tech-heavy sectors and the development of ergonomic data collection tools for all health operators. 4th critical point: organize a system of governance for a distributed and secure model at the national level to aggregate the information and services existing at the local level. Thirty-seven concrete recommendations have been formulated which should pave the way for a widespread adoption of AI in clinical research. In this context, the French \"Health data hub\" initiative constitutes an ideal opportunity.",

    "abstract": "This paper shares best practices for crisis managers and advisers, with a focus on crisis communication. These approaches are based on collecting, generating and analysing relevant real-time data. After introducing the concept of data-driven crisis strategies, the paper describes how continuous sentiment analysis can be used to tap into informal conversations on social media and other sources. The paper demonstrates how this can stimulate and improve strategic thinking, resulting in a far more effective response to a crisis situation. Using real-life examples, the paper demonstrates how such analysis techniques can deliver high-impact crisis communication that truly addresses stakeholder needs, especially compared with traditional public relations approaches. The paper describes several common methodologies that are built upon these techniques, with particular focus on crisis communication. Finally, the authors explain Stijn Pieters how enriching situational information based on data collected in the informal sphere is invaluable in a crisis. Indeed, accurate information can also significantly improve decision-making related to other crisis management disciplines. A new approach to data-driven and evidencebased crisis management is introduced, known as 'crisis intelligence'. The authors propose a model - the crisis intelligence work process - as a framework for the further development of work in this area.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have used various external variables and parameters as well as moderator variables such as emotional intelligence have been to understand emotional labor and its related problems. However, a comprehensive model to study such variables' correlations with each other and their overall effect on emotional labor has not yet been established. This study used a structural equation model to understand the relationship between employees' expression of emotional labor and perception of customer feedbacks. The study also looked at how the perception of customer feedback affects emotional exhaustion in order to understand how emotional exhaustion affects job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Further, in order to fully understand the effects of emotion on emotional labor at the service contact points, this study developed and tested a model of emotional labor with four factors of emotional intelligence as moderating factors. Five hundred and seventy nine emotional labor workers in service industries in the United States were collected and 577 valid survey results have been analyzed. The result shows that there exists moderating effects of emotional intelligence on how employees' Deep Acting and Surface Acting recognize customers' reactions, both positive and negative, that would affect employees' Emotional Exhaustion and Job Satisfaction, and hence, Turnover Intention. The result suggests that employees with better understanding of their own emotions, although they are more likely to recover from emotional exhaustion, experience a greater negative effect when there is a discrepancy between what they feel and how they should act.",

    "abstract": "There has been wide interest in using artificial intelligence (AI)-based grading of retinal images to identify diabetic retinopathy, but such a system has never been deployed and evaluated in clinical practice.\nTo describe the performance of an AI system for diabetic retinopathy deployed in a primary care practice.\nDiagnostic study of patients with diabetes seen at a primary care practice with 4 physicians in Western Australia between December 1, 2016, and May 31, 2017. A total of 193 patients consented for the study and had retinal photographs taken of their eyes. Three hundred eighty-six images were evaluated by both the AI-based system and an ophthalmologist.\nSensitivity and specificity of the AI system compared with the gold standard of ophthalmologist evaluation.\nOf the 193 patients (93 [48%] female; mean [SD] age, 55 [17] years [range, 18-87 years]), the AI system judged 17 as having diabetic retinopathy of sufficient severity to require referral. The system correctly identified 2 patients with true disease and misclassified 15 as having disease (false-positives). The resulting specificity was 92% (95% CI, 87%-96%), and the positive predictive value was 12% (95% CI, 8%-18%). Many false-positives were driven by inadequate image quality (eg, dirty lens) and sheen reflections.\nThe results demonstrate both the potential and the challenges of using AI systems to identify diabetic retinopathy in clinical practice. Key challenges include the low incidence rate of disease and the related high false-positive rate as well as poor image quality. Further evaluations of AI systems in primary care are needed.",

    "abstract": "Collective intelligence is extremely important in collective groups that discuss clinical medical cases, assisting professionals in their decision-making processes, and consequently, helping their patients.\nTo evaluate the rate of resolution and characteristics of the clinical discussions carried out in a private instant messaging group and its clinical applicability.\nRetrospective analysis of clinical discussions and events on the Vascular Forum, an open group for specialists accessed with mobile devices.\nFrom July 2015 to July 2017, 1013 subjects were discussed among 680 members. Twenty-six (2.57%) of these subjects were curiosities, 101 (9.97%) related to diagnostic doubts, 492 (48.57%) to treatment doubts, and 205 (20.24%) to general doubts, while 189 (17.5%) were case reports. The mean number of interactions per event was 16.599 (\u00b11.366). The mean time from posting of a new subject to the first reply was 42.14 (\u00b17.55) min. The subject discussed was miscellaneous in 358 cases, venous in 336 cases, lymphatic in 15 cases, and arterial in 304 cases and the total number of replies was 15985.\nInteraction between experts using instant messaging technology proved capable of raising subjects for discussion and eliciting management approaches quickly. The rate of resolution, defined as the time taken for the first correct answer to be posted, was also high. The Vascular Forum proved to be a tool of great clinical value for its participants, confirming the importance of collective intelligence in medicine.\nA intelig\u00eancia coletiva tem extrema import\u00e2ncia em grupos coletivos de discuss\u00e3o de casos cl\u00ednicos m\u00e9dicos, auxiliando tanto os profissionais na pronta tomada de decis\u00e3o como seus pacientes.\nAvaliar a resolutividade e as caracter\u00edsticas das discuss\u00f5es cl\u00ednicas realizadas em grupo fechado de mensagens instant\u00e2neas e sua aplicabilidade cl\u00ednica.\nAn\u00e1lise retrospectiva de discuss\u00f5es cl\u00ednicas e eventos no F\u00f3rum Vascular, grupo aberto para especialistas em dispositivos m\u00f3veis.\nNo per\u00edodo de julho de 2015 a julho de 2017, foram discutidos 1.013 assuntos, com 680 membros.

    "abstract": ". Human and artificial intelligence: comparison and clash of cultures. Machine learning has become ubiquitous and indispensible for solving complex problems in most sciences. As patients' conditions and medical technologies become more complex, its role will continue to grow. However the risk is of over reliance on these systems: no amount of algorithmic finesse or computing power can squeeze out information that is not present. In fact, clinical data alone have relatively limited predictive power for hospital readmissions that may have more to do with social determinants of health. Combining machine-learning software with the clinical judgement and a wise interpretation of information from health care professionals will help to increase the integration between digital world and real practice.",

    "abstract": "To construct a non-invasive prediction algorithm for predicting non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), we investigated Japanese morbidly obese patients using artificial intelligence with rule extraction technology.\nConsecutive patients who required bariatric surgery underwent a liver biopsy during the operation. Standard clinical, anthropometric, biochemical measurements were used as parameters to predict NASH and were analyzed using rule extraction technology. One hundred and two patients, including 79 NASH and 23 non-NASH patients were analyzed in order to create the prediction model, another cohort with 77 patients including 65 NASH and 12 non-NASH patients were analyzed to validate the algorithm.\nAlanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance, albumin were extracted as predictors of NASH using a recursive-rule extraction algorithm. When we adopted the extracted rules for the validation cohort using a highly accurate rule extraction algorithm, the predictive accuracy was 79.2%. The positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity were 88.9%, 35.7%, 86.2% and 41.7%, respectively.\nWe successfully generated a useful model for predicting NASH in Japanese morbidly obese patients based on their biochemical profile using a rule extraction algorithm.",

    "abstract": "The study was designed to examine whether trait emotional intelligence would moderate the impact of negative emotions at work on job burnout. A total of 188 female nurses participated in this study and completed measures of trait affectivity, emotional intelligence, anger and sadness at work, and burnout. The results revealed significant and positive relationships between both types of negative emotions and burnout above and beyond demographics and the nurses' trait affectivity. Importantly, the study demonstrated that trait emotional intelligence buffers the effects of negative emotions on burnout. Specifically, anger- and sadness-related emotions predicted greater burnout among nurses with low trait emotional intelligence but not among nurses with high trait emotional intelligence. These results suggest that emotional intelligence training could be implemented to prevent the adverse effect of negative emotions felt at work on job burnout.",

    "abstract": "Existing literature provides evidence of the connection between emotional intelligence and resilience, both concepts being adversely related to perceived stress. Nevertheless, there is little evidence from cross-cultural and/or cross-country studies of the simultaneous relationship between these psychological variables. The objective of this study was to address this lack of research, examining the associations between emotional intelligence, resilience and perceived stress in a cross-country context. A total sample of 696 undergraduate students from two universities in the United States and the Basque Country (an autonomous community in northern Spain) participated in the study. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the effects of emotional intelligence and resilience that may affect students' perceived stress. The results revealed that emotional intelligence functions as a negative predictor of perceived stress through the mediating variable resilience for the American and Basque students. The findings suggest that university students with better emotional intelligence and resilience present lower perceived stress. Thus, improving emotional intelligence and resilience could prevent students from suffering perceived stress in higher education. Implications and directions for further research are discussed; in particular, it is highlighted that intervention programs that improve both EI and resilience could be helpful in reducing perceived stress.",

    "abstract": "Intelligence analysts, like other professionals, form norms that define standards of tradecraft excellence. These norms, however, have evolved in an idiosyncratic manner that reflects the influence of prominent insiders who had keen psychological insights but little appreciation for how to translate those insights into testable hypotheses. The net result is that the prevailing tradecraft norms of best practice are only loosely grounded in the science of judgment and decision-making. The \"common sense\" of prestigious opinion leaders inside the intelligence community has pre-empted systematic validity testing of the training techniques and judgment aids endorsed by those opinion leaders. Drawing on the scientific literature, we advance hypotheses about how current best practices could well be reducing rather than increasing the quality of analytic products. One set of hypotheses pertain to the failure of tradecraft training to recognize the most basic threat to accuracy: measurement error in the interpretation of the same data and in the communication of interpretations. Another set of hypotheses focuses on the insensitivity of tradecraft training to the risk that issuing broad-brush, one-directional warnings against bias (e.g., over-confidence) will be less likely to encourage self-critical, deliberative cognition than simple response-threshold shifting that yields the mirror-image bias (e.g., under-confidence). Given the magnitude of the consequences of better and worse intelligence analysis flowing to policy-makers, we see a compelling case for greater funding of efforts to test what actually works.",

    "abstract": "High anxiety and depression are often observed in the Australian adolescent population, and if left untreated, can have long-term negative consequences impacting educational attainment and a range of important life outcomes. The utilization of mindfulness techniques has been associated with decreased anxiety and depression, but the underlying mechanisms for this is only beginning to be understood. Previous research with adult samples has suggested that the development of emotional intelligence (EI) may be one mechanism by which mindfulness confers its benefits on wellbeing. This study is the first to examine the relation between mindfulness, EI, anxiety, and depression in an adolescent population. It was hypothesized that EI would mediate the relationships between mindfulness and anxiety, as well as mindfulness and depression. The sample consisted of 108 adolescents from a public secondary school, aged between 13 and 15 years (",

    "abstract": "Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for identification of papillary carcinoma thyroid is a moderately sensitive and specific modality. The present machine learning tools can correctly classify images into broad categories. Training software for recognition of papillary thyroid carcinoma on FNAC smears will be a decisive step toward automation of cytopathology.\nThe aim of this study is to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) for the purpose of distinguishing papillary carcinoma thyroid and nonpapillary carcinoma thyroid on microphotographs from thyroid FNAC smears.\nAn ANN was developed in the Python programming language. In the training phase, 186 microphotographs from Romanowsky/Pap-stained smears of papillary carcinoma and 184 microphotographs from smears of other thyroid lesions (at \u00d710 and \u00d740 magnification) were used for training the ANN. After completion of training, performance was evaluated with a set of 174 microphotographs (66 - nonpapillary carcinoma and 21 - papillary carcinoma, each photographed at two magnifications \u00d710 and \u00d740).\nThe performance characteristics and limitations of the neural network were assessed, assuming FNAC diagnosis as gold standard. Combined results from two magnifications showed good sensitivity (90.48%), moderate specificity (83.33%), and a very high negative predictive value (96.49%) and 85.06% diagnostic accuracy. However, vague papillary formations by benign follicular cells identified wrongly as papillary carcinoma remain a drawback.\nWith further training with a diverse dataset and in conjunction with automated microscopy, the ANN has the potential to develop into an accurate image classifier for thyroid FNACs.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is a man-made device that simulates intellectual work such as human thinking and judgment. There are many successful applications of artificial intelligence in the fields of medicine, healthcare, agriculture, education, finance, service, news and machinery. Intelligent computer hospital management systems, intelligent medical diagnostic expert systems and intelligent surgical robots have revolutionized the medical field. Therefore, the attentions which are paid to artificial intelligence in cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment are on the rise. Some breakthroughs have also been made in the application of imaging diagnosis, pathological diagnosis, oncology surgery, oncology radiotherapy, drug development and cancer screening. Artificial intelligence is gradually changing the traditional medical model, which is a future direction and trend of human medical development. Here, we delineate the concept and development of artificial intelligence, and its application and prospect in the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors.\n\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u662f\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u601d\u8003\u548c\u5224\u65ad\u7b49\u667a\u529b\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u4eba\u9020\u88c5\u7f6e\u3002\u667a\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u533b\u9662\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u672f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5df2\u7ed9\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u9769\u547d\u6027\u7684\u6539\u53d8\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u65ad\u5347\u6e29\uff0c\u5728\u80bf\u7624\u5f71\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u75c5\u7406\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u80bf\u7624\u5916\u79d1\u3001\u80bf\u7624\u653e\u7597\u3001\u836f\u7269\u7814\u53d1\u3001\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u7b5b\u67e5\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6b63\u5728\u9010\u6e10\u6539\u53d8\u7740\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u533b\u7597\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u662f\u672a\u6765\u4eba\u7c7b\u533b\u7597\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u524d\u666f\u3002.",

    "abstract": "The self-other knowledge asymmetry model (SOKA) assumes that some personality traits might be open to oneself and other persons ('open area'), while other traits are more accurately perceived by others ('blind spot'); a third group of traits might be visible only to oneself and not to others ('hidden area'), and finally a trait might neither be visible to oneself nor to one's peers ('unknown area'). So far, this model has been tested only for personality traits and general intelligence, not for more specific abilities; to do so was the novel intention of our study. We tested which of six abilities (verbal, numerical, and spatial intelligence; interpersonal and intrapersonal competence; and creative potential/divergent thinking ability) are in which SOKA area. We administered performance tests for the six abilities in two samples - 233 14-year-olds and 215 18-year-olds - and collected self- and peer-ratings for each domain. Numerical intelligence and creativity were judged validly both from self- and peer-perspectives ('open area'). In the younger sample verbal intelligence was validly estimated only by peers ('blind spot'), whereas the older group showed some insight into their own abilities as well ('blind spot' to 'open area'). While in the younger group only the pupils themselves could validly estimate their intra- and interpersonal competence ('hidden area'), in the older group peers were also successful in estimating other's interpersonal competence, albeit only with low accuracy ('hidden area' to 'open area'). For 18-year-olds, spatial ability was in the hidden area too, but in 14-year-olds this could neither be validly estimated by pupils themselves nor by peers ('unknown area'). These results implicate the possibility of non-optimal career choices of young people, and could, therefore, be helpful in guiding professional career counselling.",

    "abstract": "The integration of phenotypes and genotypes is at an unprecedented level and offers new opportunities to establish deep phenotypes. There are a number of challenges to overcome, specifically, accelerated growth of data, data silos, incompleteness, inaccuracies, and heterogeneity within and across data sources. This perspective report discusses artificial intelligence (AI) approaches that hold promise in addressing these challenges by automating computable phenotypes and integrating them with genotypes. Collaborations between biomedical and AI researchers will be highlighted in order to describe initial successes with an eye toward the future.",

    "abstract": "Numerous researchers have demonstrated that deliberate rumination serves as the foremost precursor to posttraumatic growth (PTG). However, understanding the factors responsible for facilitating deliberate rumination remains limited. This study examined three factors proposed by the functional-descriptive model of PTG as facilitators of deliberate rumination-emotional intelligence, management of intrusive rumination, and goal disengagement-among the cancer survivor population. Cancer survivors (N\u2009=\u2009221) were surveyed using mail-based methodology within two months and five years of completion of all cancer treatment. Relationships among PTG, deliberate rumination, management of intrusive rumination, emotional intelligence, and goal disengagement were analyzed using path analysis. Results suggested a positive link between emotional intelligence and PTG and deliberate rumination and PTG, and a negative link between management of intrusive rumination and deliberate rumination and goal disengagement and deliberate rumination. Interventions designed to enhance deliberate rumination and emotional intelligence are warranted, and the functional-descriptive model is in need of amendment if it is to accurately capture the experience of cancer survivors.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) has often been linked to improvements in professional performance. Indeed, generic competencies related to EI have been included in university curricula. However, learning EI involves significant time and effort on the part of students, and this may hinder the acquisition of specific content for each degree. In this study, an intervention to develop EI in higher education students is described and evaluated.\nThe intervention consisted of eight group sessions performed in a regular course aiming to increase EI. The sessions included strategies and training on perceiving and understanding one's own emotions and others' emotions, identifying and understanding the impact one's own feelings in adopting decisions, expressing one's own emotions and the stress experienced, and managing both one's own emotions and emotions of others. Participants were 192 students studying for a Master of Primary Education degree. A quasi-experimental nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design was adopted. The effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated using multi-level analyses.\nThe results showed a significant improvement in the EI of students in the experimental group compared with the control group.\nThis research demonstrates that it is possible to develop EI in higher education students, without hindering the acquisition of specific content competencies and, therefore, without interfering with their academic performance and without overburdening students with work outside the classroom.\nThe experiment has been registered in the Initial Deposit of the Spanish Center for Sociological Research (CIS). 7/6/2015. http://www.cis.es/cis/opencms/ES/index.html .",

    "abstract": "Clobazam belongs to benzodiazepine class and is preferably used against anti-epileptic disorders. However, when used in reduced doses, its ability for improving cognitive functions becomes explicitly evident. This study objectively undertook the task of using the reduced doses of clobazam for proving potentials effects on cognitive functions. The drug, clobazam was administered in \"active group\" which contained 15 young healthy volunteers. The \"placebo group\" also entailed 15 subjects and each was administered with placebo drug. The controlled group\u201f also included 15 subjects. All these 45 young healthy subjects were subjected to tests for perceptual learning, creativity, selective memory, visual memory and intelligence. Results clearly demonstrated significant impact of clobazam at the dose of 5mg/day on perceptual learning (P=0.0380), creativity (P=0.0787), memory function (P=0.4920), visual memory (P=0.4816) and intelligence of the subject (P=0.4920). The outcomes highlighted in the studies reviled the positive effects of clobazam when used at reduced doses.",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of unmanned plane, autonomous vehicles, face recognition, and language processing, the artificial intelligence (AI) has remarkably revolutionized our lifestyle. Recent studies indicate that AI has astounding potential to perform much better than human beings in some tasks, especially in the image recognition field. As the amount of image data in imaging center of ophthalmology is increasing dramatically, analyzing and processing these data is in urgent need. AI has been tried to apply to decipher medical data and has made extraordinary progress in intelligent diagnosis. In this paper, we presented the basic workflow for building an AI model and systematically reviewed applications of AI in the diagnosis of eye diseases. Future work should focus on setting up systematic AI platforms to diagnose general eye diseases based on multimodal data in the real world.",

Next, it is necessary to study the basic knowledge and latest information concerning AI and possess the latest knowledge concerning modalities such as CT/MRI and imaging information systems. Finally, it is important for radiologists to not forget the viewpoint of patient-centered healthcare. It is an urgent task to nurture human resources by realizing such a healthcare AI education program to educate radiologists at an early stage. If we can evolve to become radiologists suitable for the AI era, AI will likely be our ally more than ever and healthcare will progress dramatically. As we approach the \"democratization of AI,\" it is becoming an era in which all radiologists must learn AI as they learn statistics.",

    "abstract": "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the process of identifying an appropriate sense for an ambiguous word. With the complexity of human languages in which a single word could yield different meanings, WSD has been utilized by several domains of interests such as search engines and machine translations. The literature shows a vast number of techniques used for the process of WSD. Recently, researchers have focused on the use of meta-heuristic approaches to identify the best solutions that reflect the best sense. However, the application of meta-heuristic approaches remains limited and thus requires the efficient exploration and exploitation of the problem space. Hence, the current study aims to propose a hybrid meta-heuristic method that consists of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and simulated annealing to find the global best meaning of a given text. Different semantic measures have been utilized in this model as objective functions for the proposed hybrid PSO. These measures consist of JCN and extended Lesk methods, which are combined effectively in this work. The proposed method is tested using a three-benchmark dataset (SemCor 3.0, SensEval-2, and SensEval-3). Results show that the proposed method has superior performance in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence offers the potential for transformational advancement in cardiovascular care delivery, yet practical applications of this technology have yet to be embedded in clinical workflows and systems. Recent advances in machine learning algorithms and accessibility to big data sources have created the ability for software to solve highly specialized problems outside of health care, such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, and game playing (chess and Go), at superhuman efficiency previously not thought possible. To date, high-order cognitive problems in cardiovascular research such as differential diagnosis, treatment options, and clinical risk stratification have been difficult to address at scale with artificial intelligence. The practical application of artificial intelligence in the underlying operational processes in the delivery of cardiac care may be more amenable where adoption has great potential to fundamentally transform care delivery while maintaining the core quality and service that our patients demand. In this article, we provide an overview on how these artificial intelligence platforms can be implemented to improve the operational delivery of care for patients with cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to explore the role of Emotional Intelligence (EI) and specific facets that may underpin the aetiology of disordered eating attitudes and behaviours, as a means to understand what aspects of these deficits to target within treatments.\nParticipants were recruited from the UK and Ireland. Among the sample of 355 participants, 84% were women and 16% were men. Regarding age, 59% were between 18 and 29, 30% were between 30 and 49, and 11% were 50 or older. Using a cross-sectional design, participants completed the Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test to measure levels of trait EI and The Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) as a measure of eating disorder risk and the presence of disordered eating attitudes.\nEAT-26 scores were negatively correlated with total EI scores and with the following EI subscales: appraisal of own emotions, regulation of emotions, utilisation of emotions, and optimism. Also, compared to those without an eating disorder history, participants who reported having had an eating disorder had significantly lower total EI scores and lower scores on four EI subscales: appraisal of others emotions, appraisal of own emotions, regulation of emotions, and optimism.\nConsidering these findings, EI (especially appraisal of own emotions, regulation of emotions, and optimism) may need to be addressed by interventions and treatments for eating disorders.\nLevel V, descriptive cross-sectional study.",

    "abstract": "It is predicted that in the near future robot simulated patients (SPs) will come into use. Through the impressions of five SPs about robot SPs, we explored their vision of the future of medical education as an indicator of what ordinary citizens think. The opinions of SPs were collected using a semi-structured focus group interview, after which the perspectives provided were explored using a qualitative research method called Steps for Coding and Theorization (SCAT). Although SPs accepted the introduction of robot SPs, they regard them as potential substitutes. The use of robot SPs raised concerns about the level of response to human diversity and the level of emotional intelligence. The problem of how much diversity among patients and doctors is acceptable in the field of education was identified. On the part of citizens, there is not much expectation that artificial intelligence (AI) will lead to sophisticated machines capable of human conversation. However, looking ahead to the AI era, real SPs anticipate that, along with the evolution of AI, the next generation of SPs will have thought deeply about their role within a program employing both humans and robots.",

    "abstract": "It is generally assumed that human intelligence relies on efficient processing by neurons in our brain. Although grey matter thickness and activity of temporal and frontal cortical areas correlate with IQ scores, no direct evidence exists that links structural and physiological properties of neurons to human intelligence. Here, we find that high IQ scores and large temporal cortical thickness associate with larger, more complex dendrites of human pyramidal neurons. We show in silico that larger dendritic trees enable pyramidal neurons to track activity of synaptic inputs with higher temporal precision, due to fast action potential kinetics. Indeed, we find that human pyramidal neurons of individuals with higher IQ scores sustain fast action potential kinetics during repeated firing. These findings provide the first evidence that human intelligence is associated with neuronal complexity, action potential kinetics and efficient information transfer from inputs to output within cortical neurons.",

    "abstract": "Metaphor development in conjunction with verbal intelligence and linguistic competence in middle childhood and at the transition to early adolescence was investigated. 298 individuals between seven and ten years (chronological age) who attended grades two-four (mental age) were tested for metaphor processing by the Metaphoric Triads Task, for linguistic competence (HELD), and verbal intelligence (WISC-III). Chronological age significantly predicted metaphor processing with a breakpoint of 8.2 years regarding identification and comprehension, and 10.2 years regarding preference. Fourth-graders showed highest metaphor processing scores. Verbal intelligence significantly predicted metaphor processing; this effect became stronger with increasing age. Attributional metaphors were best understood and most preferred. Chronological and mental age are associated with metaphor processing in an age span that is seemingly crucial for metaphor development. Verbal analogical reasoning, concept formation, verbal abstraction, and semantic knowledge predicted metaphor comprehension. Understanding facts, principles, and social situations, and resultant inferential verbal reasoning predicted metaphor preference.",

    "abstract": "In the United States, suicide increased by 24% in the past 20 years, and suicide risk identification at point-of-care remains a cornerstone of the effort to curb this epidemic (1). As risk identification is difficult because of symptom under-reporting, timing, or lack of screening, healthcare systems rely increasingly on risk scoring and now artificial intelligence (AI) to assess risk. AI remains the science of solving problems and accomplishing tasks, through automated or computational means, that normally require human intelligence. This science is decades-old and includes traditional predictive statistics and machine learning. Only in the last few years has it been applied rigorously in suicide risk prediction and prevention. Applying AI in this context raises significant ethical concern, particularly in balancing beneficence and respecting personal autonomy. To navigate the ethical issues raised by suicide risk prediction, we provide recommendations in three areas-communication, consent, and controls-for both providers and researchers (2).",

    "abstract": "In this study, we developed an online graphical and intuitive interface connected to a server aiming to facilitate professional access worldwide to those facing problems with bovine blastocysts classification. The interface Blasto3Q, where 3Q refers to the three qualities of the blastocyst grading, contains a description of 24 variables that were extracted from the image of the blastocyst and analyzed by three Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that classify the same loaded image. The same embryo (i.e., the biological specimen) was submitted to digital image capture by the control group (inverted microscope with 40\u00d7 magnification) and the experimental group (stereomicroscope with maximum of magnification plus 4\u00d7 zoom from the cell phone camera). The images obtained from the control and experimental groups were uploaded on Blasto3Q. Each image from both sources was evaluated for segmentation and submitted (only if it could be properly or partially segmented) for automatic quality grade classification by the three ANNs of the Blasto3Q program. Adjustments on the software program through the use of scaling algorithm software were performed to ensure the proper search and segmentation of the embryo in the raw images when they were captured by the smartphone, since this source produced small embryo images compared with those from the inverted microscope. With this new program, 77.8% of the images from smartphones were successfully segmented and from those, 85.7% were evaluated by the Blasto3Q in agreement with the control group.",

    "abstract": "Global processing bias is the automatic tendency to process the global picture before processing the local details. Recent studies suggest that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) show a lack of global processing bias. In the current study, we examined whether lack of global processing bias affects performance on 2 psychological tests, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (WAIS-IV) and the Rorschach inkblots test, which require the use of visuospatial processing while measuring different psychological constructs. Adult participants (30 ADHD and 30 typically developing controls) completed the subtests of the WAIS-IV, which rely on visuospatial components, and the Rorschach inkblots test. We found no indication of differences in general fluid intelligence between the groups. On the WAIS-IV test, ADHD participants consistently exhibited superior performance on tasks that relied on local processing and inferior performance on tasks that relied on global processing when compared with healthy controls. On the Rorschach inkblots test, ADHD participants exhibited more responses that referred to local aspects (part/s) of the stimulus and fewer responses that referred to global aspects (whole) of the stimulus. These findings imply that when patients with ADHD are given psychological tests that require visuospatial processing, a potential confound of visuospatial processing style needs to be considered.

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration are leading causes of vision loss and blindness worldwide. They tend to be asymptomatic in the early phase of disease and therefore require active screening programs to identify the patients requiring referral and treatment. Deep learning-based artificial intelligence technology has recently become a major topic in the field of ophthalmology. This paper aimed to provide a general view of the major findings on the application of deep learning for the classification of eye diseases from common imaging modalities. In the future, it is expected that these technologies will be applied in real-world screening programs to improve their efficiency and affordability.",

    "abstract": "There has been much hype, over the past few years, about the recent progress of artificial intelligence (AI), especially through machine learning. If one is to believe many of the headlines that have proliferated in the media, as well as in an increasing number of scientific publications, it would seem that AI is now capable of creating and learning in ways that are starting to resemble what humans can do. And so that we should start to hope - or fear - that the creation of fully cognisant machine might be something we will witness in our life time. However, much of these beliefs are based on deep misconceptions about what AI can do, and how. In this paper, I start with a brief introduction to the principles of AI, machine learning, and neural networks, primarily intended for psychologists and social scientists, who often have much to contribute to the debates surrounding AI but lack a clear understanding of what it can currently do and how it works. I then debunk four common myths associated with AI: 1) it can create, 2) it can learn, 3) it is neutral and objective, and 4) it can solve ethically and/or culturally sensitive problems. In a third and last section, I argue that these misconceptions represent four main dangers: 1) avoiding debate, 2) naturalising our biases, 3) deresponsibilising creators and users, and 4) missing out some of the potential uses of machine learning. I finally conclude on the potential benefits of using machine learning in research, and thus on the need to defend machine learning without romanticising what it can actually do.",

    "abstract": "Research on the role of trait emotional intelligence (trait EI; Petrides, 2001) relating to teaching performance has emerged as an important topic. The present study proposes a multilevel model of teachers' trait EI in relation to their job performance, which simultaneously addresses the mediating role of job satisfaction and the influences of school-level factors (i.e., organizational trust and principals' trait EI). Results from a sample of 881 teachers and 37 principals in Chinese primary schools showed that job satisfaction partially mediated the positive relationship between teachers' trait EI and their job performance. In addition, the findings demonstrated a cross-level moderated mediating effect, with the indirect effect of teachers' trait EI on job performance (via job satisfaction) becoming stronger for teachers working in schools with lower levels of organizational trust. The hypothesized role of principals' trait EI on teachers' job performance was not supported. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women around the world. Despite enormous medical progress, breast cancer has still remained the second leading cause of death worldwide; thus, its early diagnosis has a significant impact on reducing mortality. However, it is often difficult to diagnose breast abnormalities. Different tools such as mammography, ultrasound, and thermography have been developed to screen breast cancer. In this way, the computer helps radiologists identify chest abnormalities more efficiently using image processing and artificial intelligence (AI) tools. This article examined various methods of AI using image processing to diagnose breast cancer. It was a review study through library and Internet searches. By searching the databases such as Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) via PubMed, Springer, IEEE, ScienceDirect, and Gray Literature (including Google Scholar, articles published in conferences, government technical reports, and other materials not controlled by scientific publishers) and searching for breast cancer keywords, AI and medical image processing techniques were extracted. The results were provided in tables to demonstrate different techniques and their results over recent years. In this study, 18,651 articles were extracted from 2007 to 2017. Among them, those that used similar techniques and reported similar results were excluded and 40 articles were finally examined. Since each of the articles used image processing, a list of features related to the image used in each article was also provided. The results showed that support vector machines had the highest accuracy percentage for different types of images (ultrasound =95.85%, mammography =93.069%, thermography =100%). Computerized diagnosis of breast cancer has greatly contributed to the development of medicine, is constantly being used by radiologists, and is clear in ethical and medical fields with regard to its effects. Computer-assisted methods increase diagnosis accuracy by reducing false positives.",

    "abstract": "To offer practical guidance to nurse investigators interested in multidisciplinary research that includes assisting in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for \"smart\" health management and aging-in-place.\nTen health-assistive Smart Homes were deployed to chronically ill older adults from 2015 to 2018. Data were collected using five sensor types (infrared motion, contact, light, temperature, and humidity). Nurses used telehealth and home visitation to collect health data and provide ground truth annotation for training intelligent algorithms using raw sensor data containing health events.\nNurses assisting with the development of health-assistive AI may encounter unique challenges and opportunities. We recommend: (a) using a practical and consistent method for collecting field data, (b) using nurse-driven measures for data analytics, (c) multidisciplinary communication occur on an engineering-preferred platform.\nPractical frameworks to guide nurse investigators integrating clinical data with sensor data for training machine learning algorithms may build capacity for nurses to make significant contributions to developing AI for health-assistive Smart Homes.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) is considered as a factor influencing sport performance. The research findings are inconsistent with respect to the size and even the direction of the relationship, however. In order to summarise the available evidence, we conducted a meta-analysis examining the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and sports performance in competitive sports. A systematic literature search was conducted in June 2018. We identified 21 studies targeting EI and sports performance in competitive sports. We calculated correlation (r) to estimate the effect of the relationship. A random effects model was used to interpret findings. The meta-analysis of 22 effect sizes on the response of 3.431 participants found a small but significant relationship between EI and sports performance (",

    "abstract": "Health care workers need artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a set of studies and techniques that tend to the realization of machines, which solve complex problems automatically, simulating or emulating human intelligence activities. Human intelligence is innate, creative, emotional, sporting, social in the collective and connected future. Knowledge is the faculty, act, mode, effect of taking possession, intellectually or psychologically, with systematic activity of any certain aspect of reality. The dates are given in the form of text, number, symbol, image, sounds that are used or stored in computers. Having many data or data does not mean having much information. Having a lot of information does not mean having a lot of knowledge. Symbolic reasoning uses symbolic logic, logical connectives, expert systems, production rules, genetic algorithms, validation, explanation, justification, verification of inference, heuristic research. The knowledge of symbolic reasoning is deterministic. Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed to do so. Use algorithms for statistical and probability calculations, the learning phases may not be verifiable. They are mathematically structured human opinions, spoiled by the pre -understandings of those who design them, of those who want to look for something. The association between symbolic reasoning and automatic learning is excellent. The intelligence of health workers work connected and collective, develop knowledge bases to be subjected to symbolic reasoning, expert systems and rules to have deterministic knowledge. The deterministic knowledge subsequently elaborated by artificial intelligence will be returned to human intelligences.",

    "abstract": "The endocytoscopic system (ECS) helps in virtual realization of histology and can aid in confirming histological diagnosis in vivo. We propose replacing biopsy-based histology for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) by using the ECS. We applied deep-learning artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse ECS images of the esophagus to determine whether AI can support endoscopists for the replacement of biopsy-based histology.\nA convolutional neural network-based AI was constructed based on GoogLeNet and trained using 4715 ECS images of the esophagus (1141 malignant and 3574 non-malignant images). To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the AI, an independent test set of 1520 ECS images, collected from 55 consecutive patients (27 ESCCs and 28 benign esophageal lesions) were examined.\nOn the basis of the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, the areas under the curve of the total images, higher magnification pictures, and lower magnification pictures were 0.85, 0.90, and 0.72, respectively. The AI correctly diagnosed 25 of the 27 ESCC cases, with an overall sensitivity of 92.6%. Twenty-five of the 28 non-cancerous lesions were diagnosed as non-malignant, with a specificity of 89.3% and an overall accuracy of 90.9%. Two cases of malignant lesions, misdiagnosed as non-malignant by the AI, were correctly diagnosed as malignant by the endoscopist. Among the 3 cases of non-cancerous lesions diagnosed as malignant by the AI, 2 were of radiation-related esophagitis and one was of gastroesophageal reflux disease.\nAI is expected to support endoscopists in diagnosing ESCC based on ECS images without biopsy-based histological reference.",

    "abstract": "Students in need of mental health care face many barriers including cost, location, availability, and stigma. Studies show that computer-assisted therapy and 1 conversational chatbot delivering cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) offer a less-intensive and more cost-effective alternative for treating depression and anxiety. Although CBT is one of the most effective treatment methods, applying an integrative approach has been linked to equally effective posttreatment improvement. Integrative psychological artificial intelligence (AI) offers a scalable solution as the demand for affordable, convenient, lasting, and secure support grows.\nThis study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of using an integrative psychological AI, Tess, to reduce self-identified symptoms of depression and anxiety in college students.\nIn this randomized controlled trial, 75 participants were recruited from 15 universities across the United States. All participants completed Web-based surveys, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) at baseline and 2 to 4 weeks later (T2). The 2 test groups consisted of 50 participants in total and were randomized to receive unlimited access to Tess for either 2 weeks (n=24) or 4 weeks (n=26). The information-only control group participants (n=24) received an electronic link to the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) eBook on depression among college students and were only granted access to Tess after completion of the study.\nA sample of 74 participants completed this study with 0% attrition from the test group and less than 1% attrition from the control group (1/24). The average age of participants was 22.9 years, with 70% of participants being female (52/74), mostly Asian (37/74, 51%), and white (32/74, 41%). Group 1 received unlimited access to Tess, with daily check-ins for 2 weeks. Group 2 received unlimited access to Tess with biweekly check-ins for 4 weeks. The information-only control group was provided with an electronic link to the NIMH's eBook. Multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted. We used an alpha level of .05 for all statistical tests. Results revealed a statistically significant difference between the control group and group 1, such that group 1 reported a significant reduction in symptoms of depression as measured by the PHQ-9 (P=.03), whereas those in the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found between the control group and both test groups 1 and 2 for symptoms of anxiety as measured by the GAD-7. Group 1 (P=.045) and group 2 (P=.02) reported a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety, whereas the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found on the PANAS between the control group and group 1 (P=.03) and suggests that Tess did impact scores.\nThis study offers evidence that AI can serve as a cost-effective and accessible therapeutic agent. Although not designed to appropriate the role of a trained therapist, integrative psychological AI emerges as a feasible option for delivering support.\nInternational Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number: ISRCTN61214172; https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN61214172.",

    "results": "A sample of 74 participants completed this study with 0% attrition from the test group and less than 1% attrition from the control group (1/24). The average age of participants was 22.9 years, with 70% of participants being female (52/74), mostly Asian (37/74, 51%), and white (32/74, 41%). Group 1 received unlimited access to Tess, with daily check-ins for 2 weeks. Group 2 received unlimited access to Tess with biweekly check-ins for 4 weeks. The information-only control group was provided with an electronic link to the NIMH's eBook. Multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted. We used an alpha level of .05 for all statistical tests. Results revealed a statistically significant difference between the control group and group 1, such that group 1 reported a significant reduction in symptoms of depression as measured by the PHQ-9 (P=.03), whereas those in the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found between the control group and both test groups 1 and 2 for symptoms of anxiety as measured by the GAD-7. Group 1 (P=.045) and group 2 (P=.02) reported a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety, whereas the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found on the PANAS between the control group and group 1 (P=.03) and suggests that Tess did impact scores.",

    "abstract": "The fields of radiotherapy and clinical oncology have been rapidly changed by the advances of technology. Improvement in computer processing power and imaging quality heralded precision radiotherapy allowing radiotherapy to be delivered efficiently, safely and effectively for patient benefit. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field of computer science which uses computer models and algorithms to replicate human-like intelligence and perform specific tasks which offers a huge potential to healthcare. We reviewed and presented the history, evolution and advancement in the fields of radiotherapy, clinical oncology and machine learning. Radiotherapy target delineation is a complex task of outlining tumour and organ at risks volumes to allow accurate delivery of radiotherapy. We discussed the radiotherapy planning, treatment delivery and reviewed how technology can help with this challenging process. We explored the evidence and clinical application of machine learning to radiotherapy. We concluded on the challenges, possible future directions and potential collaborations to achieve better outcome for cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has potential to improve the accuracy of screening for valvular and congenital heart disease by auscultation. However, despite recent advances in signal processing and classification algorithms focused on heart sounds, clinical acceptance of this technology has been limited, in part due to lack of objective performance data. We hypothesized that a heart murmur detection algorithm could be quantitatively and objectively evaluated by virtual clinical trial. All cases from the Johns Hopkins Cardiac Auscultatory Recording Database (CARD) with either a pathologic murmur, an innocent murmur or no murmur were selected. The test algorithm, developed independently of CARD, analyzed each recording using an automated batch processing protocol. 3180 heart sound recordings from 603 outpatient visits were selected from CARD. Algorithm estimation of heart rate was similar to gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of pathologic cases were 93% (CI 90-95%) and 81% (CI 75-85%), respectively, with accuracy 88% (CI 85-91%). Performance varied according to algorithm certainty measure, age of patient, heart rate, murmur intensity, location of recording on the chest and pathologic diagnosis. This is the first reported comprehensive and objective evaluation of an AI-based murmur detection algorithm to our knowledge. The test algorithm performed well in this virtual clinical trial. This strategy can be used to efficiently compare performance of other algorithms against the same dataset and improve understanding of the potential clinical usefulness of AI-assisted auscultation.",

    "abstract": "We sought to investigate the diagnostic performance of coronary CT angiography (cCTA)-derived plaque markers combined with deep machine learning-based fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) to identify lesion-specific ischemia using invasive FFR as the reference standard.\nEighty-four patients (61\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u00a0years, 65% male) who had undergone cCTA followed by invasive FFR were included in this single-center retrospective, IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant study. Various plaque markers were derived from cCTA using a semi-automatic software prototype and deep machine learning-based CT-FFR. The discriminatory value of plaque markers and CT-FFR to identify lesion-specific ischemia on a per-vessel basis was evaluated using invasive FFR as the reference standard.\nOne hundred three lesion-containing vessels were investigated. 32/103 lesions were hemodynamically significant by invasive FFR. In a multivariate analysis (adjusted for Framingham risk score), the following markers showed predictive value for lesion-specific ischemia (odds ratio [OR]): lesion length (OR 1.15, p\u2009=\u20090.037), non-calcified plaque volume (OR 1.02, p\u2009=\u20090.007), napkin-ring sign (OR 5.97, p\u2009=\u20090.014), and CT-FFR (OR 0.81, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). A receiver operating characteristics analysis showed the benefit of identifying plaque markers over cCTA stenosis grading alone, with AUCs increasing from 0.61 with \u2265\u200950% stenosis to 0.83 with addition of plaque markers to detect lesion-specific ischemia. Further incremental benefit was realized with the addition of CT-FFR (AUC 0.93).\nCoronary CTA-derived plaque markers portend predictive value to identify lesion-specific ischemia when compared to cCTA stenosis grading alone. The addition of CT-FFR to plaque markers shows incremental discriminatory power.\n\u2022 Coronary CT angiography (cCTA)-derived quantitative plaque markers of atherosclerosis portend high discriminatory power to identify lesion-specific ischemia. \u2022 Coronary CT angiography-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) shows superior diagnostic performance over cCTA alone in detecting lesion-specific ischemia. \u2022 A combination of plaque markers with CT-FFR provides incremental discriminatory value for detecting flow-limiting stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Pharmaceutical companies rely on regulatory intelligence (RI) to analyze information from internal and external sources. To facilitate RI activities, companies are seeking ways to harness technology to optimize their capabilities. Specifically, there is a growing interest for artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance RI activities. However, exploration of the potential utility of AI and related technologies will be key to begin unlocking these tools for the regulatory community.\nTo identify potential development paths for these technologies, we interviewed over 30 global regulatory leaders at 22 pharmaceutical companies and 3 leading companies in RI and AI technologies. Thirteen of the 22 pharmaceutical companies also provided responses to a subsequent informational survey.\nThis study elucidated potential value proposition, barriers, and risks to integrating AI into the RI field. Twenty of the 22 participating companies consider that AI offers significant opportunity for RI activities of data processing (mining, searching, monitoring, alerting). Thirty-two percent of companies envisage use in data synthesis (combining different types of information across formats), 36% in data analysis (trends, patterns, predictive analytics), and 23% in decision making. Additionally, results of this research provided insights about the potential role of precompetitive consortia, which may enhance future actualization.\nOpportunity presents for AI to enhance quality, speed, and efficiency of RI activities. This assessment of the current technology landscape revealed a lack of fully developed AI tools; however, the RI community demand is beginning to be recognized. Therefore, now more than ever, the timing to advance AI within the RI field is right.",

Twenty of the 22 participating companies consider that AI offers significant opportunity for RI activities of data processing (mining, searching, monitoring, alerting). Thirty-two percent of companies envisage use in data synthesis (combining different types of information across formats), 36% in data analysis (trends, patterns, predictive analytics), and 23% in decision making. Additionally, results of this research provided insights about the potential role of precompetitive consortia, which may enhance future actualization.",

    "abstract": "The doctor-patient relationship has been evolving from benevolent paternalism to a more patient-centered relationship in the modern era. Although artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve nearly every aspect of health care, many physicians are skeptical about integrating AI into their current medical practice. The purpose of this article is to explore what AI means for the doctor-patient relationship and for breast imaging radiologists.\nThe promise of AI is its potential to release physicians from tasks that are better performed by automation. AI may enhance our diagnostic accuracy to the point that we are able to refocus on the art of the doctor-patient relationship.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS) is an important technique in protein research. Effective classification methods by MS data could contribute to early and less-invasive diagnosis and also facilitate developments in the bioinformatics field. As MS data is featured by high dimension, appropriate methods which can effectively deal with the large amount of MS data have been widely studied. In this paper, the applications of methods based on intelligence algorithms have been investigated. Firstly, classification and biomarker analysis methods using typical machine learning approaches have been discussed. Then those are followed by the Ensemble strategy algorithms. Clearly, simple and basic machine learning algorithms hardly addressed the various needs of protein MS classification. Preprocessing algorithms have been also studied, as these methods are useful for feature selection or feature extraction to improve classification performance. Protein MS data growing with data volume becomes complicated and large; improvements in classification methods in terms of classifier selection and combinations of different algorithms and preprocessing algorithms are more emphasized in further work.",

    "abstract": "Computer-aided diagnosis offers a promising solution to reduce variation in colonoscopy performance. Pooled miss rates for polyps are as high as 22%, and associated interval colorectal cancers after colonoscopy are of concern. Optical biopsy, whereby in-vivo classification of polyps based on enhanced imaging replaces histopathology, has not been incorporated into routine practice because it is limited by interobserver variability and generally only meets accepted standards in expert settings. Real-time decision-support software has been developed to detect and characterise polyps, and also to offer feedback on the technical quality of inspection. Some of the current algorithms, particularly with recent advances in artificial intelligence techniques, match human expert performance for optical biopsy. In this Review, we summarise the evidence for clinical applications of computer-aided diagnosis and artificial intelligence in colonoscopy.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform IMRT treatment planning for head and neck patients. However, the complexity and novelty of AI algorithms make them susceptible to misuse by researchers and clinicians. Understanding nuances of new technologies could serve to mitigate potential clinical implementation pitfalls. This article is intended to facilitate integration of AI into the radiotherapy clinic by providing an overview of AI algorithms, including support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and several variations of deep learning. This document describes current AI algorithms that have been applied to head and neck IMRT planning and identifies rapidly growing branches of AI in industry that have potential applications to head and neck cancer patients receiving IMRT. AI algorithms have great clinical potential if used correctly but can also cause harm if misused, so it is important to raise the level of AI competence within radiation oncology so that the benefits can be realized in a controlled and safe manner.",

Evolving technologies, namely artificial intelligence, challenge the status quo by improving patient care in four areas: diagnosis, management, research and systems analysis. Artificial intelligence shows promise in promoting practice efficiency, personalizing patient care, improving institutional research capacity, and expanding high quality orthopaedic care to lower resource settings. Physicians should be involved in the development of artificial intelligence algorithms to ensure that patients derive maximum benefit from new advances while considering the ethical challenges of implementation.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been massive progress in artificial intelligence (AI) with the development of deep neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision and robotics. These techniques are now actively being applied in healthcare with many of the health service activities currently being delivered by clinicians and administrators predicted to be taken over by AI in the coming years. However, there has also been exceptional hype about the abilities of AI with a mistaken notion that AI will replace human clinicians altogether. These perspectives are inaccurate, and if a balanced perspective of the limitations and promise of AI is taken, one can gauge which parts of the health system AI can be integrated to make a meaningful impact. The four main areas where AI would have the most influence would be: patient administration, clinical decision support, patient monitoring and healthcare interventions. This health system where AI plays a central role could be termed an AI-enabled or AI-augmented health system. In this article, we discuss how this system can be developed based on a realistic assessment of current AI technologies and predicted developments.",

This new generation of technologies will be able to communicate with the brain in ways that support contextual learning and adaptation to changing functional requirements. This applies to both invasive technologies aimed at restoring neurological function, as in the case of neural prosthesis, as well as non-invasive technologies enabled by signals such as electroencephalograph (EEG). Advances in computation, hardware, and algorithms that learn and adapt in a contextually dependent way will be able to leverage the capabilities that nanoengineering offers the design and functionality of BMI. We explore the enabling capabilities that these devices may exhibit, why they matter, and the state of the technologies necessary to build them. We also discuss a number of open technical challenges and problems that will need to be solved in order to achieve this.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence was recognised many years ago as a potential and powerful tool to predict disease outcome in many clinical situations. The conventional approaches using statistical methods have provided much information, but are subject to limitations imposed by the complexity of medical data. The structures of the important variants of the machine learning system artificial neural networks (ANN) are discussed and emphasis is given to the powerful analytical support that could be provided by ANN for the prediction of cancer progression and prognosis. The predictive ability of the cellular markers, DNA ploidy and cell-cycle profiles, and molecular markers, such as tumour promoter and suppressor gene, and growth factor and steroid hormone receptors in breast cancer management were also analysed. ANN systems have been successfully deployed to evaluate microRNA profiles of tumours which saliently sway cancer progression and prognosis of the disease, thus counteracting the negative implications of their numerical abundance. Finally, in this setting, the prospective technical improvements in artificial neural networks, as hybrid systems in combination with fuzzy logic and artificial immune networks were also addressed.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of mathematical engineering which has potential to enhance healthcare through new care delivery strategies, informed decision making and facilitation of patient engagement. Machine learning (ML) is a form of narrow artificial intelligence which can be used to automate decision making and make predictions based upon patient data.\nThis review outlines key applications of supervised and unsupervised machine learning in musculoskeletal medicine; such as diagnostic imaging, patient measurement data, and clinical decision support. The current literature base is examined to identify areas where ML performs equal to or more accurately than human levels.\nPotential is apparent for intelligent machines to enhance various areas of physiotherapy practice through automization of tasks which involve data analysis, classification and prediction. Changes to service provision through applications of ML, should encourage physiotherapists to increase their awareness of and experiences with emerging technologies. Data literacy should be a component of professional development plans to assist physiotherapists in the application of ML and the preparation of information technology systems to use these techniques.",

    "abstract": "The past few years have seen a considerable rise in interest towards artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in radiology. However, in order for such systems to perform adequately, large amounts of training data are required. These data should ideally be standardised and of adequate quality to allow for further usage in training of artificial intelligence algorithms. Unfortunately, in many current clinical and radiological information technology ecosystems, access to relevant pieces of information is difficult. This is mostly because a significant portion of information is handled as a collection of narrative texts and interoperability is still lacking. This review aims at giving a brief overview on how structured reporting can help to facilitate research in artificial intelligence and the context of big data.",

    "abstract": "Leachate is one of the main surface water pollution sources in Selangor State (SS), Malaysia. The prediction of leachate amounts is elementary in sustainable waste management and leachate treatment processes, before discharging to surrounding environment. In developing countries, the accurate evaluation of leachate generation rates has often considered a challenge due to the lack of reliable data and high measurement costs. Leachate generation is related to several factors, including meteorological data, waste generation rates, and landfill design conditions. The high variations in these factors lead to complicating leachate modeling processes. This study aims at identifying the key elements contributing to leachate production and developing various AI-based models to predict leachate generation rates. These models included Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-Multi-linear perceptron (MLP) with single and double hidden layers, and support vector machine (SVM) regression time series algorithms. Various performance measures were applied to evaluate the developed model's accuracy. In this study, input optimization process showed that three inputs were acceptable for modeling the leachate generation rates, namely dumped waste quantity, rainfall level, and emanated gases. The initial performance analysis showed that ANN-MLP2 model-which applies two hidden layers-achieved the best performance, then followed by ANN-MLP1 model-which applies one hidden layer and three inputs-while SVM model gave the lowest performance. Ranges and frequency of relative error (RE%) also demonstrate that ANN-MLP models outperformed SVM models. Furthermore, low and peak flow criterion (LFC and PFC) assessment of leachate inflow values in ANN-MLP model with two hidden layers made more accurate values than other models. Since minimizing data collection and processing efforts as well as minimizing modeling complexity are critical in the hydrological modeling process, the applied input optimization process and the developed models in this study were able to provide a good performance in the modeling of leachate generation efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Cortical thickness and surface area are thought to be genetically unrelated and shaped by independent neurobiological events suggesting that they should be considered separately in morphometric analyses. Although the developmental trajectories of cortical thickness and surface area may differ across brain regions and ages, there is no consensus regarding the relationships of physical fitness with cortical thickness and surface area as well as for its subsequent influence on intelligence. Thus, this study examines: (i) the associations of physical fitness components (i.e., cardiorespiratory fitness, speed-agility and muscular fitness) with overall and regional cortical thickness and surface area; (ii) whether body composition indicators (i.e., body mass index, fat-free mass index and fat mass index) mediate these associations; and (iii) the association of physical fitness and cortical thickness with intelligence in overweight/obese children. A total of 101 overweight/obese children aged 8-11 years were recruited in Granada, Spain. The physical fitness components were assessed following the ALPHA health-related fitness test battery. T1-weighted images were acquired with a 3.0\u202fTesla\u202fSiemens Magnetom Tim Trio system. We used FreeSurfer software version 5.3.0 to assess cortical thickness (mm) and surface area (mm",

    "abstract": "Although the deep learning system has been applied to interpretation of medical images, its application to the diagnosis of cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer has not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of deep learning image classification for diagnosis of lymph node metastasis.\nThe imaging data used for evaluation consisted of computed tomography (CT) images of 127 histologically proven positive cervical lymph nodes and 314 histologically proven negative lymph nodes from 45 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. The performance of a deep learning image classification system for the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis on CT images was compared with the diagnostic interpretations of 2 experienced radiologists by using the Mann-Whitney U test and \u03c7\nThe performance of the deep learning image classification system resulted in accuracy of 78.2%, sensitivity of 75.4%, specificity of 81.0%, positive predictive value of 79.9%, negative predictive value of 77.1%, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80. These values were not significantly different from those found by the radiologists.\nThe deep learning system yielded diagnostic results similar to those of the radiologists, which suggests that this system may be valuable for diagnostic support.",

    "abstract": "Levofloxacin is used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; however the optimal dose is unknown.\nWe used the hollow fiber system model of tuberculosis (HFS-TB) to identify 0-24 hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-24) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratios associated with maximal microbial kill and suppression of acquired drug resistance (ADR) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Levofloxacin-resistant isolates underwent whole-genome sequencing. Ten thousands patient Monte Carlo experiments (MCEs) were used to identify doses best able to achieve the HFS-TB-derived target exposures in cavitary tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis. Next, we used an ensemble of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify the most important predictors of sputum conversion, ADR, and death in Tanzanian patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treated with a levofloxacin-containing regimen. We also performed probit regression to identify optimal levofloxacin doses in Vietnamese tuberculous meningitis patients.\nIn the HFS-TB, the AUC0-24/MIC associated with maximal Mtb kill was 146, while that associated with suppression of resistance was 360. The most common gyrA mutations in resistant Mtb were Asp94Gly, Asp94Asn, and Asp94Tyr. The minimum dose to achieve target exposures in MCEs was 1500 mg/day. AI algorithms identified an AUC0-24/MIC of 160 as predictive of microbiologic cure, followed by levofloxacin 2-hour peak concentration and body weight. Probit regression identified an optimal dose of 25 mg/kg as associated with >90% favorable response in adults with pulmonary tuberculosis.\nThe levofloxacin dose of 25 mg/kg or 1500 mg/day was adequate for replacement of high-dose moxifloxacin in treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "In the experimental arm of the OFLOTUB trial, gatifloxacin replaced ethambutol in the standard 4-month regimen for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis. The study included a nested pharmacokinetic (PK) study. We sought to determine if PK variability played a role in patient outcomes.\nPatients recruited in the trial were followed for 24 months, and relapse ascertained using spoligotyping. Blood was drawn for drug concentrations on 2 separate days during the first 2 months of therapy, and compartmental PK analyses was performed. Failure to attain sustained sputum culture conversion at the end of treatment, relapse, or death during follow-up defined therapy failure. In addition to standard statistical analyses, we utilized an ensemble of machine-learning methods to identify patterns and predictors of therapy failure from among 27 clinical and laboratory features.\nOf 126 patients, 95 (75%) had favorable outcomes and 19 (15%) failed therapy, relapsed, or died. Pyrazinamide and rifampicin peak concentrations and area under the concentration-time curves (AUCs) were ranked higher (more important) than gatifloxacin AUCs. The distribution of individual drug concentrations and their ranking varied significantly between South African and West African trial sites; however, drug concentrations still accounted for 31% and 75% of variance of outcomes, respectively. We identified a 3-way antagonistic interaction of pyrazinamide, gatifloxacin, and rifampicin concentrations. These negative interactions disappeared if rifampicin peak concentration was above 7 mg/L.\nConcentration-dependent antagonism contributed to death, relapse, and therapy failure but was abrogated by high rifampicin concentrations. Therefore, increasing both rifampin and gatifloxacin doses could improve outcomes.\nNCT00216385.",

    "abstract": "Targeted mass spectrometry has become the method of choice to gain absolute quantification information of high quality, which is essential for a quantitative understanding of biological systems. However, the design of absolute protein quantification assays remains challenging due to variations in peptide observability and incomplete knowledge about factors influencing peptide detectability. Here, we present a deep learning algorithm for peptide detectability prediction, d::pPop, which allows the informed selection of synthetic proteotypic peptides for the successful design of targeted proteomics quantification assays. The deep neural network is able to learn a regression model that relates the physicochemical properties of a peptide to its ion intensity detected by mass spectrometry. The approach makes use of experimentally detected deviations from the assumed equimolar abundance of all peptides derived from a given protein. Trained on extensive proteomics datasets, d::pPop's plant and non-plant specific models can predict the quality of proteotypic peptides for not yet experimentally identified proteins. Interrogating the deep neural network after learning from ~76,000 peptides per model organism allows to investigate the impact of different physicochemical properties on the observability of a peptide, thus providing insights into peptide observability as a multifaceted process. Empirical evaluation with rank accuracy metrics showed that our prediction approach outperforms existing algorithms. We circumvent the delicate step of selecting positive and negative training sets and at the same time also more closely reflect the need for selecting the top most promising peptides for targeting a protein of interest. Further, we used an artificial QconCAT protein to experimentally validate the observability prediction. Our proteotypic peptide prediction approach not only facilitates the design of absolute protein quantification assays via a user-friendly web interface but also enables the selection of proteotypic peptides for not yet observed proteins, hence rendering the tool especially useful for plant research.",

    "abstract": "Chronic musculoskeletal neck and back pain are disabling conditions among adults. Use of technology has been suggested as an alternative way to increase adherence to exercise therapy, which may improve clinical outcomes.\nThe aim was to investigate the self-perceived benefits of an artificial intelligence (AI)-embedded mobile app to self-manage chronic neck and back pain.\nA total of 161 participants responded to the invitation. The evaluation questionnaire included 14 questions that were intended to explore if using the AI rehabilitation system may (1) increase time spent on therapeutic exercise, (2) affect pain level (assessed by the 0-10 Numerical Pain Rating Scale), and (3) reduce the need for other interventions.\nAn increase in time spent on therapeutic exercise per day was observed. The median Numerical Pain Rating Scale scores were 6 (interquartile range [IQR] 5-8) before and 4 (IQR 3-6) after using the AI-embedded mobile app (95% CI 1.18-1.81). A 3-point reduction was reported by the participants who used the AI-embedded mobile app for more than 6 months. Reduction in the usage of other interventions while using the AI-embedded mobile app was also reported.\nThis study demonstrated the positive self-perceived beneficiary effect of using the AI-embedded mobile app to provide a personalized therapeutic exercise program. The positive results suggest that it at least warrants further study to investigate the physiological effect of the AI-embedded mobile app and how it compares with routine clinical care.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) and mindfulness are two constructs that have been separately studied, and the relation between them still remains unclear. Research in this area has not attempted to go further into how enhancing EI and mindfulness together can achieve better improvements in this ability to attend mindfully. To bridge this knowledge gap, our research goal was to study the relationship between EI and the mindfulness competence in our study sample and to assess the impact of implementing EI and a mindfulness competence developmental program (SEA) about participants' mindfulness competence. The sample consisted of 156 students aged 11-14 years old from a Spanish public high school. One hundred and eight participants were randomly assigned to the experimental condition, and the remaining 48 were to the control condition. The instruments used to evaluate EI were the CDE-SEC, EQi-Youth Version and the General Empathy Scale. Mindfulness on the School Scope Scale was used to assess mindfulness competences. Social adaptation was evaluated by using the social abilities and adjustment questionnaire BAS3. All the instruments where answered by the participants and have been adapted to a sample of youths with such age specifications. The results showed that EI and mindfulness were related to many of the variables measured by the instruments. Showing a good mindfulness competence was particularly related to having a good general level of the EI trait, and to many of the assessed social and emotional variables. The data indicated a significant relation between the mindfulness competence and having better general empathy skills or being better socially adjusted to the school context. The data also indicated a significant effect on participants' interior and kinesthetic mindfulness competence after implementing the SEA Program. These findings corroborate the relationship between EI and mindfulness, and the possibility of enhancing mindfulness by applying a direct intervention program in the classroom.",

    "abstract": "The applications of modern artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms within the field of aging research offer tremendous opportunities. Aging is an almost universal unifying feature possessed by all living organisms, tissues, and cells. Modern deep learning techniques used to develop age predictors offer new possibilities for formerly incompatible dynamic and static data types. AI biomarkers of aging enable a holistic view of biological processes and allow for novel methods for building causal models-extracting the most important features and identifying biological targets and mechanisms. Recent developments in generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning (RL) permit the generation of diverse synthetic molecular and patient data, identification of novel biological targets, and generation of novel molecular compounds with desired properties and geroprotectors. These novel techniques can be combined into a unified, seamless end-to-end biomarker development, target identification, drug discovery and real world evidence pipeline that may help accelerate and improve pharmaceutical research and development practices. Modern AI is therefore expected to contribute to the credibility and prominence of longevity biotechnology in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry, and to the convergence of countless areas of research.",

    "abstract": "Clinical success of immunotherapy is driving the need for new prognostic and predictive assays to inform patient selection and stratification. This requirement can be met by a combination of computational pathology and artificial intelligence. Here, we critically assess computational approaches supporting the development of a standardized methodology in the assessment of immune-oncology biomarkers, such as PD-L1 and immune cell infiltrates. We examine immunoprofiling through spatial analysis of tumor-immune cell interactions and multiplexing technologies as a predictor of patient response to cancer treatment. Further, we discuss how integrated bioinformatics can enable the amalgamation of complex morphological phenotypes with the multiomics datasets that drive precision medicine. We provide an outline to machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence tools and illustrate fields of application in immune-oncology, such as pattern-recognition in large and complex datasets and deep learning approaches for survival analysis. Synergies of surgical pathology and computational analyses are expected to improve patient stratification in immuno-oncology. We propose that future clinical demands will be best met by (1) dedicated research at the interface of pathology and bioinformatics, supported by professional societies, and (2) the integration of data sciences and digital image analysis in the professional education of pathologists.",

    "abstract": "A World Health Organization 2017 report stated that major depression affects almost 5% of the human population. Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes.\nThis study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression.\nIn the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations.\nThe average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging.\nThe real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.",

Essential information about the application of AI to radiology includes a description of the available algorithms with a glossary; a review of the issues raised by healthcare data, notably those pertaining to imaging (imaging data and co-variables, metadata); a look at research and innovation; an overview of current and future applications; a discussion of AI education; and a scrutiny of ethical issues. In addition to the principles set forth at the Asilomar Conference on Beneficial AI, the French radiology community has developed ten principles aimed at governing the use and development of AI tools in a manner that will create a concerted approach centered on benefits to patients, while also ensuring good integration within clinical workflows. High-quality care in radiology and opportunities for managing large datasets are two avenues relevant to the development of a precision, personalized, and participative radiology practice characterized by improved predictive and preventive capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Higher emotional Intelligence (EI) is linked to improved doctor-patient relationships, empathy, teamwork, communication skills, stress management, and leadership in medicine. This study analyzes the effects of age, postgraduate year (PGY), gender, and prior military experience on EI in military general surgery residents, and compares these to the general population and civilian surgery residents.\nThis is a retrospective, observational study. Results were analyzed using independent sample t test and linear regression to compare general surgery residents with the normative population and civilian general surgery residents.\nThe general surgery department at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, a single-center, academic institution.\nAll general surgery residents, PGY 1 to 6, were surveyed at the beginning of academic year, in June 2016.\nThere were no statistically discernable differences in global EI between male (n\u202f=\u202f27) and female residents (n\u202f=\u202f19), PGY, or prior military experience. Female general surgery residents show higher global EI, and both males and females scored higher in the self-control factor than the normative population. Mid-residency, there is a nonstatistically discernible dip in many factors and facets of EI.\nGender differences in EI present in the general population were not appreciated in our cohort of surgery residents, which confirms the results of previous studies. This may be due to the fact that general surgery residents are a more uniform group than the population at large. Additionally, our cohort of military surgery residents demonstrated similar global EI to civilian surgery residents. While PGY had no statistically discernable affect on global, facet, or factor EI, more studies are needed to longitudinally follow changes in EI over the course of surgery residency.",

    "abstract": "The intertwining of chemoinformatics with artificial intelligence (AI) has given a tremendous fillip to the field of drug discovery. With the rapid growth of chemical data from high throughput screening and combinatorial synthesis, AI has become an indispensable tool for drug designers to mine chemical information from large compound databases for developing drugs at a much faster rate as never before. The applications of AI have gone beyond bioactivity predictions and have shown promise in addressing diverse problems in drug discovery like de novo molecular design, synthesis prediction and biological image analysis. In this article, we provide an overview of all the algorithms under the umbrella of AI, enlist the tools/frameworks required for implementing these algorithms as well as present a compendium of web servers, databases and open-source platforms implicated in drug discovery, Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR), data mining, solvation free energy and molecular graph mining.",

    "abstract": "The advent of the autonomous car is paving the road to the realization of ideas that will help optimize traffic flows, increase safety and reduce fuel consumption, among other advantages. We present one proposal to bring together Virtual Traffics Lights (VTLs) and platooning in urban scenarios, leaning on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication protocols that turn intersections into virtual containers of data. Newly-introduced protocols for the combined management of VTLs and platoons are validated by simulation, comparing a range of routing protocols for the vehicular networks with the baseline given by common deployments of traditional traffic lights ruled by state-of-the-art policies. The simulation results show that the combination of VTLs and platoons can achieve significant reductions in travel times and fuel consumption, provided that proper algorithms are used to handle the V2V communications.",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in early language skills have been found to be associated with other cognitive outcomes in childhood and adolescence. However, research is limited on whether these associations persist into adulthood. In this study, we examined potential associations of the timing of early language milestones with cognitive ability in a prospective cohort study of 938 singletons from the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort (CPC), who participated in a 50-year follow-up examination in 2009-2011. Later attainment of a number of milestones was associated with lower midlife IQ with the strongest associations found for 'Naming objects/animals in pictures', 'Forming a sentence', and 'Sharing experiences'. Milestones related to language explained 6.7% of the variance in midlife IQ, while milestones related to social interaction explained 3.1%. The\u00a0study provides evidence that individual differences in language development during the first years of life are associated with intelligence in midlife. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Differences in early language skills are associated with other cognitive skills in childhood and adolescence. No study has examined this association from childhood through midlife in a large community-based sample. What does this study add? Early language development is associated with intelligence in midlife. A total of 6.7% of the variance in midlife IQ is explained by milestones related to language. Adjustment for potentially confounding factors did not change the associations.",

Various skin problems have similar symptoms. For example, in German measles (rubella), Chicken pox and Measles (rubella) a similarity can be observed in skin rashes and redness. The prognosis of skin problems take a long time as the patient's previous medical records, physical examination report and the respective laboratory diagnostic reports have to be studied. The recognition and diagnosis get tough due to the complexity involved. Subsequently, a computer aided analysis and recognition gadget would be handy in such cases. Computer algorithm steps include image processing, picture characteristic extraction and categorize facts with the help of a classifier with Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The ANN can analyze the patterns of symptoms of a particular disease and present faster prognosis and reputation than a human doctor. For this reason, the patients can undergo the treatment for the pores and skin problems based totally on the symptoms detected.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To compare breast cancer detection performance of radiologists reading mammographic examinations unaided versus supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) system. Materials and Methods An enriched retrospective, fully crossed, multireader, multicase, HIPAA-compliant study was performed. Screening digital mammographic examinations from 240 women (median age, 62 years; range, 39-89 years) performed between 2013 and 2017 were included. The 240 examinations (100 showing cancers, 40 leading to false-positive recalls, 100 normal) were interpreted by 14 Mammography Quality Standards Act-qualified radiologists, once with and once without AI support. The readers provided a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score and probability of malignancy. AI support provided radiologists with interactive decision support (clicking on a breast region yields a local cancer likelihood score), traditional lesion markers for computer-detected abnormalities, and an examination-based cancer likelihood score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity and sensitivity, and reading time were compared between conditions by using mixed-models analysis dof variance and generalized linear models for multiple repeated measurements. Results On average, the AUC was higher with AI support than with unaided reading (0.89 vs 0.87, respectively; P = .002). Sensitivity increased with AI support (86% [86 of 100] vs 83% [83 of 100]; P = .046), whereas specificity trended toward improvement (79% [111 of 140]) vs 77% [108 of 140]; P = .06). Reading time per case was similar (unaided, 146 seconds; supported by AI, 149 seconds; P = .15). The AUC with the AI system alone was similar to the average AUC of the radiologists (0.89 vs 0.87). Conclusion Radiologists improved their cancer detection at mammography when using an artificial intelligence system for support, without requiring additional reading time.

    "abstract": "The quality of input data in deep learning is tightly associated with the ultimate performance of the machine learner. Taking advantage of the unique merits of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) methodology in the collection and construction of a database (e.g., abundant intrinsic fingerprint information, noninvasive data acquisition process, strong anti-interfering ability, etc.), herein we set up a SERS-based database of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), suitable for artificial intelligence (AI)-based sensing applications. The database is collected and analyzed by silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs)-decorated silicon wafer (Ag NPs@Si) SERS chip, followed by training with a deep neural network (DNN). As proof-of-concept applications, three kinds of representative tumor suppressor genes, i.e., p16, p21, and p53 fragments, are readily discriminated in a label-free manner. Prominent and reproducible SERS spectra of these DNA molecules are collected and employed as input data for DNN learning and training, which enables selective discrimination of DNA target(s). The accuracy rate for the recognition of specific DNA target reached 90.28%.",

    "abstract": "The Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis proposes that individuals in complex social groups require sophisticated social cognition. This hypothesis has advanced our understanding of the complex social lives of animals and how individuals interact with others in their groups. Machiavellian intelligence is the capacity of an individual to alter the behavior of others around it to the individual's own advantage. This capacity is typically facilitated by complex communicative systems, social systems, and cognitive abilities. Curiously, communication among group members has not traditionally been a focus of research related to the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis. Here, we show how a focus on communicative and cognitive complexity together can elucidate nuanced manipulations for selfish gains in socially complex groups, under both competitive and cooperative scenarios. Finally, we argue more generally that a research emphasis on communication in complex social groups may accelerate our understanding of the social mechanisms underlying complex adaptive behavior.

    "abstract": "The question of what has shaped primates' (and other species') cognitive capacities, whether technical or social demands, remains a hot topic of inquiry. Indeed, a key area of study within the field of comparative psychology in the last few decades has been the focus on social life as a driving force behind the evolution of cognition, studied from behavioral and neurological perspectives and from theoretical and empirical perspectives. Reflecting on contemporary studies of primate social cognition specifically, one cannot ignore the book, Machiavellian Intelligence, coedited by Richard Byrne and Andrew Whiten (Byrne & Whiten, 1988a). It is a keystone for the field: The volume as a whole has been cited over 3,000 times, without even including citations to individual chapters. This year, 2018, is the 30th anniversary of the first publication of Machiavellian Intelligence, and with this special issue of the Journal of Comparative Psychology, we mark that milestone. The key concept put forth in Machiavellian Intelligence was that primates' sociocognitive abilities were shaped by the complex social worlds that they inhabited, rather than the technical or foraging challenges that they faced, as had previously been posited. In this issue, we consider the strength of the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis 30 years on to explain primate social cognition, and we consider its applicability to nonprimate species and to other cognitive domains.

    "abstract": "Research shows that maltreated children are at elevated risk of arrest as adults and that higher verbal intelligence, reading ability, and executive functioning (abstract reasoning and cognitive flexibility) may be protective against criminal behavior. The current study examines this hypothesis using data from court-substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect and demographically matched controls followed prospectively into middle adulthood ( N = 1,196). At age 29, verbal intelligence was assessed with the Quick Test and reading ability with the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised. At age 41, abstract reasoning was assessed with the Matrix Reasoning Test and cognitive flexibility with the Trail Making Test-B. Arrest records were gathered from law enforcement agencies through mean age 51. Data were analyzed with binomial logistic regressions. The results indicated that maltreated children were at increased risk of arrest for nonviolent and violent crime. Higher verbal intelligence, reading ability, nonverbal reasoning, and cognitive flexibility were protective against arrest for violent crime. The protective effects of neuropsychological functions were more pronounced for violent than nonviolent crime, for the control than maltreated children, and differed by gender and race. These results suggest that interventions targeting improved cognitive and neuropsychological functions may serve an important role in reducing risk of crime.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of radiotherapy interruption (RTI) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).\nA total of 7826 patients using the well-established big-data intelligence platform were identified. Computer-generated random numbers were used to assign these patients into a training cohort (n\u202f=\u202f3913 patients) and an internal validation cohort (n\u202f=\u202f3913 patients). RTI was defined as the difference between radiation treatment time and planned radiation time (assuming a Monday start). Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method for survival, and log-rank test to evaluate difference. Optimal RTI threshold was identified using the recursive partitioning analyses (RPAs). Multivariate analysis was performed using the Weibull model. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).\nThe optimal threshold of RTI with respect to OS in the training cohort was 6.5 d based on RPAs. Therefore, a uniform threshold of 7 d (<7 vs. \u22657 d) was selected to classify both training and validation cohorts into high and low RTI groups for survival analysis. RTI of \u22657 d showed significant detrimental effects on OS in both training (5-y OS, 82.4% vs 86.5%; P\u202f=\u202f0.001) and validation cohorts (5-y OS, 85.2% vs 86.7%; P\u202f=\u202f0.013) than those patients with RTI of <7 d. Consistent with results of the univariate analysis, RTI of \u22657 d was found to be an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for OS in both training (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.14-1.95; P\u202f=\u202f0.003) and validation cohort (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07-1.65; P\u202f=\u202f0.031). Subgroup analysis showed that RTI of \u22657 d had significant adverse effects on prognosis of NPC patients receiving IMRT, regardless of TNM stage and chemotherapy (P\u202f<\u202f0.05 for all).\nIn the IMRT era, RTI independently influences survival. Raising RTI\u202f\u2265\u202f7 d was consistently unfavorable for NPC survival. Medical practitioners must remind patients on the importance of minimizing RT interruptions.",

    "abstract": "Rapid advances in science challenge the timely adoption of evidence-based care in community settings. To bridge the gap between what is possible and what is practiced, we researched approaches to developing an artificial intelligence (AI) application that can provide real-time patient-specific decision support.\nThe Oncology Expert Advisor (OEA) was designed to simulate peer-to-peer consultation with three core functions: patient history summarization, treatment options recommendation, and management advisory. Machine-learning algorithms were trained to construct a dynamic summary of patients cancer history and to suggest approved therapy or investigative trial options. All patient data used were retrospectively accrued. Ground truth was established for approximately 1,000 unique patients. The full Medline database of more than 23 million published abstracts was used as the literature corpus.\nOEA's accuracies of searching disparate sources within electronic medical records to extract complex clinical concepts from unstructured text documents varied, with F1 scores of 90%-96% for non-time-dependent concepts (e.g., diagnosis) and F1 scores of 63%-65% for time-dependent concepts (e.g., therapy history timeline). Based on constructed patient profiles, OEA suggests approved therapy options linked to supporting evidence (99.9% recall; 88% precision), and screens for eligible clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov (97.9% recall; 96.9% precision).\nOur results demonstrated technical feasibility of an AI-powered application to construct longitudinal patient profiles in context and to suggest evidence-based treatment and trial options. Our experience highlighted the necessity of collaboration across clinical and AI domains, and the requirement of clinical expertise throughout the process, from design to training to testing.\nArtificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital advisors such as the Oncology Expert Advisor have the potential to augment the capacity and update the knowledge base of practicing oncologists. By constructing dynamic patient profiles from disparate data sources and organizing and vetting vast literature for relevance to a specific patient, such AI applications could empower oncologists to consider all therapy options based on the latest scientific evidence for their patients, and help them spend less time on information \"hunting and gathering\" and more time with the patients. However, realization of this will require not only AI technology maturation but also active participation and leadership by clincial experts.",

    "abstract": "Intelligence in large-brained vertebrates might have evolved through independent, yet similar processes based on comparable socioecological pressures and slow life histories. This convergent evolutionary route, however, cannot explain why cephalopods developed large brains and flexible behavioural repertoires: cephalopods have fast life histories and live in simple social environments. Here, we suggest that the loss of the external shell in cephalopods (i) caused a dramatic increase in predatory pressure, which in turn prevented the emergence of slow life histories, and (ii) allowed the exploitation of novel challenging niches, thus favouring the emergence of intelligence. By highlighting convergent and divergent aspects between cephalopods and large-brained vertebrates we illustrate how the evolution of intelligence might not be constrained to a single evolutionary route.",

    "abstract": "Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) are biocompatible and biodegradable nanoscale systems with extensive application for controlled drug release. However, the development of optimal nanosystems along with a reproducible manufacturing process is still challenging. In this study, a two-step experimental design was performed and databases were successfully modelled using Artificial Intelligence techniques as an innovative method to get optimal, reproducible and stable NLC. The initial approach, including a wide range of values for the different variables, was followed by a second set of experiments with variable values in a narrower range, more suited to the characteristics of the system. NLC loaded with rifabutin, a hydrophobic drug model, were produced by hot homogenization and fully characterized in terms of particle size, size distribution, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency and drug loading. The use of Artificial Intelligence tools has allowed to elucidate the key parameters that modulate each formulation property. Stable nanoparticles with low sizes and polydispersions, negative zeta potentials and high drug loadings were obtained when the proportion of lipid components, drug, surfactants and stirring speed were optimized by FormRules",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to empirically explore whether or not the level of emotional intelligence of adolescents mitigates the potential adverse effects of the fear of terror on their psychological well-being. Data for this study were collected through a voluntary survey from a sample of 385 adolescents residing in the terrorism-affected provinces of Pakistan: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) and Balochistan. The results from the structural equation modeling revealed that fear of terrorism had a significant negative relationship with the psychological well-being of adolescents. The study results further revealed that emotional intelligence significantly moderated the relationship between the fear of terrorism and the psychological well-being of the adolescents. Therefore, the negative relationship was stronger for those with low emotional intelligence and weaker for those with high emotional intelligence. This study also discusses several practical implications along with suggestions for future research.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of infant and toddler head growth on intelligence scores from early childhood to adulthood in very preterm (&lt;32 weeks gestational age; VP) and/or very low birth weight (&lt;1500 g; VLBW) and term born individuals.\n203 VP/VLBW and 198 term comparisons were studied from birth to adulthood as part of the prospective geographically defined Bavarian Longitudinal Study (BLS). Head circumference was assessed at birth; 5, 20 months; and 4 years of age. Intelligence was assessed with standardized tests in childhood (6 and 8 years: K-ABC) and at 26 years (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, WAIS). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to model the effect of head growth on IQ.\nOn average, VP/VLBW had lower head circumference at birth (27.61 cm vs. 35.11 cm, mean difference 7.49, 95% confidence interval [7.09-7.90]) and lower adult intelligence scores (88.98 vs. 102.54, mean difference 13.56 [10.59-16.53]) than term born comparison individuals. Head circumference at birth (e.g., total effect \u03b2=.48; p&lt;.001 for adult IQ) and head growth in childhood predicted intelligence development from age 6 to 26 years in both VP/VLBW and term born individuals (70% of variance in adult IQ explained by full model). Effects of gestation and birth weight on intelligence were fully mediated by head circumference and growth.\nThis longitudinal investigation from birth to adulthood indicates head growth as a proxy of brain development and intelligence. Repeated early head circumference assessment adds valuable information when screening for long-term neurocognitive risk. (JINS, 2019, 25, 48#x2013;56).",

Furthermore, one-sixth of respondents who would otherwise rank radiology as the first choice would not consider radiology because of the anxiety about AI. Prior significant exposure to radiology and high confidence in understanding of AI were shown to decrease the anxiety level. Interested students valued the opinions of local radiologists, radiology conferences, and journals. Students were most interested in \"expert opinions on AI\" and \"discussing AI in preclinical radiology lectures\" to understand the impact of AI.\nAnxiety related to \"displacement\" (not \"replacement\") of radiologists by AI discouraged many medical students from considering the radiology specialty.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have promised to revolutionize the way we live and work, and one of the particularly promising areas for AI is image analysis. Nevertheless, many current AI applications focus on the post-processing of data, while in both materials sciences and medicine, it is often critical to respond to the data acquired on the fly. Here we demonstrate an artificial intelligence atomic force microscope (AI-AFM) that is capable of not only pattern recognition and feature identification in ferroelectric materials and electrochemical systems, but can also respond to classification via adaptive experimentation with additional probing at critical domain walls and grain boundaries, all in real time on the fly without human interference. Key to our success is a highly efficient machine learning strategy based on a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm capable of high fidelity pixel-by-pixel recognition instead of relying on the data from full mapping, making real time classification and control possible during scanning, with which complex electromechanical couplings at the nanoscale in different material systems can be resolved by AI. For AFM experiments that are often tedious, elusive, and heavily rely on human insight for execution and analysis, this is a major disruption in methodology, and we believe that such a strategy empowered by machine learning is applicable to a wide range of instrumentations and broader physical machineries.",

    "abstract": "The Smart Home designed to extend older adults independence is emerging as a clinical solution to the growing ageing population. Nurses will and should play a key role in the development and application of Smart Home technology. Accordingly, conceptual frameworks are needed for nurse scientists who are collaborating with multidisciplinary research teams in developing an intelligent Smart Home that assists with managing older adults' health. We present a conceptual framework that is grounded in critical realism and pragmatism, informing a unique mixed methodological approach to generating, analyzing, and contextualizing sensor data for clinician-based machine learning. This framework can guide nurse scientists in knowledge construction as they participate in multidisciplinary health-assistive Smart Home and artificial intelligence research. In this paper, we review philosophical underpinnings and explicate how this framework can guide nurse scientists collaborating with engineers to develop intelligent health-assistive Smart Homes. It is critical that clinical nursing knowledge is integrated into Smart Home and artificial intelligence features. A conceptual framework and practical method will provide needed structure for knowledge construction by nurse scientists.",

    "abstract": "The present study has two objectives: first, to analyze whether the dimensions that make up emotional intelligence (attention, clarity, and repair) give rise to different profiles of university students, and secondly, to determine whether these different profiles are differentially associated with the parenting practices that students report with regard to their fathers and mothers. Results obtained indicate the existence of different profiles of college students. The profile that corresponds to adequate emotional skills presents a lower score in attention, but higher scores in clarity, and especially in mood repair. The other two profiles are inadequate, in the first case because a higher score in emotional attention is accompanied by low scores in mood repair, and in the second case because low scores are presented in all three dimensions. Likewise, we verified the existence of significant differences in the educational practices of parents, the adequate profile is characterized by greater use of parenting dimensions considered to be positive, and at the same time, lower scores on dimensions considered to be negative. One of the dysfunctional profiles is associated with higher scores in positive practices, and is also associated with higher scores in practices considered to produce a negative effect. The second dysfunctional profile is associated with higher scores on the dimensions considered to be negative and lower scores on positive dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease affecting the vast majority of people. UTI involves a simple infection caused by urinary tract inflammation as well as a complicated infection that may be caused by an inflammation of other urinary tract organs. Since all of these infections have similar symptoms, it is difficult to identify the cause of primary infection. Therefore, it is not easy to diagnose a UTI with routine examination procedures. Invasive methods that require surgery could be necessary. This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence model to support the diagnosis of UTI with complex symptoms.\nFirstly, routine examination data and definitive diagnosis results for 59 UTI patients gathered and composed as a UTI dataset. Three classification models namely; decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN), which are widely used in medical diagnosis systems, were created to model the definitive diagnosis results using the composed UTI dataset. Accuracy, specificity and sensitivity statistical measurements were used to determine the performance of created models.\nDT, SVM, RF and ANN models have 93.22%, 96.61%, 96.61%, 98.30% accuracy, 95.55%, 97.77%, 95.55%, 97.77% sensitivity and 85.71%, 92.85%, 100%, 100% specificy results, respectively.\nANN has the highest accuracy result of 98.3% for UTI diagnosis within the proposed models. Although several symptoms, laboratory findings, and ultrasound results are needed for clinical UTI diagnosis, this ANN model only needs pollacuria, suprapubic pain symptoms and erythrocyte to get the same diagnosis with such accuracy. This proposed model is a successful medical decision support system for UTI with complex symptoms. Usage of this artificial intelligence method has its advantages of lower diagnosis cost, lower diagnosis time and there is no need for invasive methods.",

    "abstract": "Pho regulon is a highly evolved and conserved mechanism across the microbes to fulfil their phosphate need. In this study, 52 proteobacteria genomes were analyzed for the presence of phosphorus acquisition genes, their pattern of arrangement and copy numbers. The diverse genetic architecture of the Pho regulon genes indicates the evolutionary challenge of nutrient limitation, particularly phosphorus, faced by bacteria in their environment. The incongruence between the Pho regulon proteins phylogeny and species phylogeny along with the presence of additional copies of pstS and pstB genes, having cross similarity with other genera, suggest the possibility of horizontal gene transfer event. The substitution rate analysis and multiple sequence alignment of the Pho regulon proteins were analyzed to gain additional insight into the evolution of the Pho regulon system. This comprehensive study confirms that genes perform the regulatory function (phoBR) were vertically inherited, whereas interestingly, genes whose product involved in direct interaction with the environment (pstS) acquired by horizontal gene transfer. The substantial amino acid substitutions in PstS most likely contribute to the successful adaptation of bacteria in different ecological condition dealing with different phosphorus availability. The findings decipher the intelligence of the bacteria which enable them to carry out the targeted alteration of genes to cope up with the environmental condition.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural network (CNN) type artificial intelligences were trained to estimate the Cerenkov radiation present in the temporal response of a LINAC irradiated scintillator-fiber optic dosimeter. The CNN estimate of Cerenkov radiation is subtracted from the combined scintillation and Cerenkov radiation temporal response of the irradiated scintillator-fiber optic dosimeter, giving the sole scintillation signal, which is proportional to the scintillator dose. The CNN measured scintillator dose was compared to the background subtraction measured scintillator dose and ionisation chamber measured dose. The dose discrepancy of the CNN measured dose was on average 1.4% with respect to the ionisation chamber measured dose, matching the 1.4% average dose discrepancy of the background subtraction measured dose with respect to the ionisation chamber measured dose. The developed CNNs had an average time of 3\u2009ms to calculate scintillator dose, permitting the CNNs presented to be applicable for dosimetry in real time.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of intelligence and executive function (EF) is common in complex neuropsychiatric practice. Although previous studies have shown that EF and intelligence are related, it is unknown whether these constructs relate to one another in a similar manner across different ability groups (mild intellectual disability, borderline intellectual disability and normal/high intelligence). This study therefore examines the relation between three EFs (inhibition, shifting and updating) and intelligence in a heterogeneous psychiatric sample. It is hypothesised that the strength of the relation between intelligence and the three EFs decreases when the level of intelligence increases, in accordance with Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns.\nIn a cross-sectional, between and within subject design, one of the three intelligence tests (Kaufman Adolescent and Adult Intelligence Test and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - third and fourth editions) and several EF tests (Stroop Colour-Word Test, Trail Making Test and Spatial Working Memory task) were administered to 250 neuropsychiatric inpatients and outpatients (M\nAnalyses showed significant correlations between the constructs of EF and intelligence. A significant interaction effect was found for shifting, with highest correlations in the normal to high intelligence group, but not for inhibition and updating.\nResults support a specific role for shifting in this EF-intelligence relation. The correlational pattern of updating and intelligence, as well as the differential relation of shifting and intelligence across ability groups, suggests that EF tasks may not measure distinct EFs in lower intellectual ability but rely on cognitive primitives such as processing speed. EF tasks can be considered less valid indicators of EF ability. Implications in terms of the need for development of specific tasks to measure cognition in low intellectual ability are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Echocardiography plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. However, interpretation remains largely reliant on the subjective expertise of the operator. As a result inter-operator variability and experience can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies provide new possibilities for echocardiography to generate accurate, consistent and automated interpretation of echocardiograms, thus potentially reducing the risk of human error. In this review, we discuss a subfield of AI relevant to image interpretation, called machine learning, and its potential to enhance the diagnostic performance of echocardiography. We discuss recent applications of these methods and future directions for AI-assisted interpretation of echocardiograms. The research suggests it is feasible to apply machine learning models to provide rapid, highly accurate and consistent assessment of echocardiograms, comparable to clinicians. These algorithms are capable of accurately quantifying a wide range of features, such as the severity of valvular heart disease or the ischaemic burden in patients with coronary artery disease. However, the applications and their use are still in their infancy within the field of echocardiography. Research to refine methods and validate their use for automation, quantification and diagnosis are in progress. Widespread adoption of robust AI tools in clinical echocardiography practice should follow and have the potential to deliver significant benefits for patient outcome.",

    "abstract": "Associations between the varying levels of emotional intelligence in newly hired oncology nurses and their responses to stress and coping were examined. The secondary aim was to analyze whether emotional intelligence could moderate their choice of problem-focused or emotion-focused coping strategies.\nNewly hired nurses (n\u00a0=\u00a0114) were recruited from a national cancer institute. Data were collected through surveys using the Ways of Coping Questionnaire, the Nursing Stress Scale, and the Emotional Quotient Inventory between the eighth and twelfth weeks post-hire date. Descriptive and bivariate statistical analyses were conducted on all variables. Regression models determined whether emotional intelligence moderated the choice of coping strategies.\nEmotional intelligence had a mean value of M\u00a0=\u00a0105.24, SD\u00a0=\u00a013.02, and occupational stress scores were M\u00a0=\u00a065.57, SD\u00a0=\u00a015.68. Significant negative correlations were found for occupational stress and problem-focused coping (r\u00a0=\u00a0-.189, P\u00a0=\u00a0.022), emotional intelligence and emotion-focused coping (r\u00a0=\u00a0-.340, P\u00a0=\u00a0.000), and emotional intelligence and occupational stress (r\u00a0=\u00a0-.428, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Emotional intelligence did not predict the choice of coping strategies.\nAlthough emotional intelligence did not moderate coping strategies in newly hired nurses, using problem focused coping to address occupational stress during the initial employment period may be a protective factor for coping with stress in the oncology workplace.",

    "abstract": "The Job Demands\u2013Resources Theory (JD-R) is one of the most influential theoretical frameworks for explaining work engagement. The JD-R postulates the existence of a health impairment process in which job demands lead to strain, and of a motivational process in which job resources lead to work engagement. Although cognitive functions are among the most important characteristics of employees related to job, still little is known about its moderating role in JD-R processes; hence in this study we make a novel attempt to test the invariance of JD-R propositions among employees at different levels of cognitive functioning.\nA group of 383 multioccupational employees completed a set of questionnaires measuring job resource: co-worker support, supervisor support, performance feedback; job demands: emotional demands, occupational constraints, work-home interferences; Utrecht Work Engagement Scale; Oldenburg Burnout Inventory along with 2 working memory and 3 fluid intelligence tests.\nThe multigroup invariance analysis with latent variables revealed that both the health impairment process and the motivational process as postulated by JD-R are invariant across groups of employees with either high or low levels of fluid intelligence and working memory capacity.\nThis result provides the first piece of evidence for JD-R robustness among employees at different levels of cognitive functioning. Our findings counterintuitively suggest that employees with high cognitive functioning are not more resistant to job demands than employees with low cognitive functioning and that in order to be work-engaged they need job resources, no less than their colleagues with low cognitive functioning.

This study addresses this issue using an individual differences approach in which Central Executive System (CES) and Short-Term Storage (STS) components of WM are measured comprehensively and examined for their relationship with g via event-related potentials components (P200 and P300) as mediators. Participants (n\u2009=\u2009115) completed tests of the WM, CES and STS, as well as g. P200 and P300 components were recorded during 3-back WM task performance. Structural equation modelling showed significant negative associations between the P200 latency for target stimuli and CES shifting processes, and between the P300 amplitude for target stimuli and CES inhibition and updating processes. The relationship between CES processes and g was mediated in a localized fashion by the P300 amplitude. These findings further support the notion that the CES has a multidimensional structure and, importantly, reveal that the inhibition and updating functions of the CES are crucial in explaining the relationship between WM and g. Negative relations between ERP indices (P200 latency and P300 amplitude for target stimuli) and g support a neural efficiency hypothesis related to high intelligence.",

    "abstract": "The construct of emotional intelligence (EI) broadly reflects the idea that individuals differ in their disposition/ability to adaptively generate, recognize, understand, and regulate the emotions of self and others. However, while the neural processes underlying such differences have begun to receive investigation, no brain-based model of EI has yet been proposed to help guide the design and interpretation of neuroimaging research in this area. In this article, we propose a neural model of EI to fill this need. This model incorporates recent insights from emotion theory, computational neuroscience, and large-scale network models of brain function. It also highlights several domain general processes - including those underlying conceptualization, automatic attention, habit formation, and cognitive control - that offer plausible targets for improving EI with training. Our model offers considerable promise in advancing understanding of intelligent emotional functioning and in guiding future neuroscience research on EI.",

    "abstract": "Higher life expectancy is increasing the number of age-related cognitive impairment cases. It is also relevant, as some authors claim, that physical exercise may be considered as an adjunctive therapy to improve cognition and memory after strokes. Thus, the integration of physical and cognitive therapies could offer potential benefits. In addition, in general these therapies are usually considered boring, so it is important to include some features that improve the motivation of patients. As a result, computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation systems and serious games for health are more and more present. In order to achieve a continuous, efficient and sustainable rehabilitation of patients, they will have to be carried out as part of the rehabilitation in their own home. However, current home systems lack the therapist's presence, and this leads to two major challenges for such systems. First, they need sensors and actuators that compensate for the absence of the therapist's eyes and hands. Second, the system needs to capture and apply the therapist's expertise. With this aim, and based on our previous proposals, we propose an ambient intelligence environment for cognitive rehabilitation at home, combining physical and cognitive activities, by implementing a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) that gathers, as far as possible, the knowledge of a rehabilitation expert. Moreover, smart sensors and actuators will attempt to make up for the absence of the therapist. Furthermore, the proposed system will feature a remote monitoring tool, so that the therapist can supervise the patients' exercises. Finally, an evaluation will be presented where experts in the rehabilitation field showed their satisfaction with the proposed system.",

    "abstract": "Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an important analysis technique with applications in many industrial branches and fields of scientific research. Nowadays, the advantages of LIBS are impaired by the main drawback in the interpretation of obtained spectra and identification of observed spectral lines. This procedure is highly time-consuming since it is essentially based on the comparison of lines present in the spectrum with the literature database. This paper proposes the use of various computational intelligence methods to develop a reliable and fast classification of quasi-destructively acquired LIBS spectra into a set of predefined classes. We focus on a specific problem of classification of paper-ink samples into 30 separate, predefined classes. For each of 30 classes (10 pens of each of 5 ink types combined with 10 sheets of 5 paper types plus empty pages), 100 LIBS spectra are collected. Four variants of preprocessing, seven classifiers (decision trees, random forest, ",

    "abstract": "The distal root of the mandibular first molar occasionally has an extra root, which can directly affect the outcome of endodontic therapy. In this study, we examined the diagnostic performance of a deep learning system for classification of the root morphology of mandibular first molars on panoramic radiographs. Dental cone-beam CT (CBCT) was used as the gold standard.\nCBCT images and panoramic radiographs of 760 mandibular first molars from 400 patients who had not undergone root canal treatments were analyzed. Distal roots were examined on CBCT images to determine the presence of a single or extra root. Image patches of the roots were segmented from panoramic radiographs and applied to a deep learning system, and its diagnostic performance in the classification of root morphplogy was examined.\nExtra roots were observed in 21.4% of distal roots on CBCT images. The deep learning system had diagnostic accuracy of 86.9% for the determination of whether distal roots were single or had extra roots.\nThe deep learning system showed high accuracy in the differential diagnosis of a single or extra root in the distal roots of mandibular first molars.",

    "abstract": "Intelligence is a core construct of individual differences in cognitive abilities and a strong predictor of important life outcomes. Within recent years, rates of cesarean section have substantially increased globally, though little is known about its effect on neurodevelopmental trajectories. Thus, we aimed to investigate the influence of delivery by cesarean section on the genetics of intelligence in children.\nParticipants were recruited through the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Intelligence was measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Human Hap 550 quad genome-wide SNP genotyping platform and was followed by imputation using MACH software. Genome-wide interaction analyses were conducted using linear regression.\nA total of 2,421 children and 2,141,747 SNPs were subjected to the genome-wide interaction analyses. No variant reached genome-wide significance. The strongest interaction was observed at rs17800861 in the GRIN2A gene (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-3.43, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-4.74 to -2.12, p\u00a0=\u00a02.98E-07). This variant is predicted to be located within active chromatin compartments in the hippocampus and may influence binding of the NF-kappaB transcription factor.\nOur results may indicate that mode of delivery might have a moderating effect on genetic disposition of intelligence in children. Studies of considerable sizes (>10,000) are likely required to more robustly detect variants governing such interaction. In summary, the presented findings prompt the need for further studies aimed at increasing our understanding of effects various modes of delivery may have on health outcomes in children.",

    "abstract": "The first CT scanners in the early 1970s already used iterative reconstruction algorithms; however, lack of computational power prevented their clinical use. In fact, it took until 2009 for the first iterative reconstruction algorithms to come commercially available and replace conventional filtered back projection. Since then, this technique has caused a true hype in the field of radiology. Within a few years, all major CT vendors introduced iterative reconstruction algorithms for clinical routine, which evolved rapidly into increasingly advanced reconstruction algorithms. The complexity of algorithms ranges from hybrid-, model-based to fully iterative algorithms. As a result, the number of scientific publications on this topic has skyrocketed over the last decade. But what exactly has this technology brought us so far? And what can we expect from future hardware as well as software developments, such as photon-counting CT and artificial intelligence? This paper will try answer those questions by taking a concise look at the overall evolution of CT image reconstruction and its clinical implementations. Subsequently, we will give a prospect towards future developments in this domain. KEY POINTS: \u2022 Advanced CT reconstruction methods are indispensable in the current clinical setting. \u2022 IR is essential for photon-counting CT, phase-contrast CT, and dark-field CT. \u2022 Artificial intelligence will potentially further increase the performance of reconstruction methods.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated effect of mental rotation (MR) training on learning outcomes and explored effectiveness of teaching via three-dimensional (3D) software among medical students with diverse spatial intelligence. Data from n = 67 student volunteers were included. A preliminary test was conducted to obtain baseline level of MR competency and was utilized to assign participants to two experimental conditions, i.e., trained group (n = 25) and untrained group (n = 42). Data on the effectiveness of training were collected to measure participants' speed and accuracy in performing various MR activities. Six weeks later, a large class format (LCF) session was conducted for all students using 3D software. The usefulness of technology-assisted learning at the LCF was evaluated via a pre- and post-test. Students' feedback regarding MR training and use of 3D software was acquired through questionnaires. MR scores of the trainees improved from 25.9\u00b14.6 points to 28.1\u00b14.4 (P = 0.011) while time taken to complete the tasks reduced from 20.9\u00b13.9 to 12.2\u00b14.4 minutes. Males scored higher than females in all components (P = 0.016). Further, higher pre- and post-test scores were observed in trained (9.0\u00b11.9 and 12.3\u00b11.6) versus untrained group (7.8\u00b11.8; 10.8\u00b11.8). Although mixed-design analysis of variance suggested significant difference in their test scores (P < 0.001), both groups reported similar trend in improvement by means of 3D software (P = 0.54). Ninety-seven percent of students reported technology-assisted learning as an effective means of instruction and found use of 3D software superior to plastic models. Software based on 3D technologies could be adopted as an effective teaching pedagogy to support learning across students with diverse levels of mental rotation abilities.",

    "abstract": "In order to be successful in sport, athletes need a high level of physical skills as well as cognitive abilities.\nThe aim of this studywas to investigate the relationship between emotional intelligence, reaction time, aerobic capacity and performance (recorded time) in female track & field athletes at the Universities of Tehran.\nData was collected from 100 female athletes participating in sprints.The emotional intelligence in athletes was measured by the Bar-On questionnaire, the reaction time was assessed by the psychomotor vigilance task, and maximal aerobic capacity was predicted by step test. Pearson correlation calculations were conducted to investigate the potential relationships between emotional intelligence total score, reaction time, and estimated VO2max, with recorded time of the students.\nAverage age of female athletes was 20.59 years (\u00b11.55) and mean height of them was 163.63\u200acm (\u00b16.03).The mean emotional intelligence in athletes was 302.05 (\u00b120.18), the mean reaction time was 431.14\u200ams (\u00b1114.88), and mean maximal aerobic capacity was predicted as 62.82\u200aml/ kg.min (\u00b10.6). The findings revealed that there is no significant correlation between emotional intelligence and recorded time or athletic performance (p\u200a>\u200a0.05).There were significant correlations between some components of emotional intelligence (empathy, interpersonal relations, and independence) and athletes' recorded time. Reaction time and aerobic capacity were significantly correlated with athletes' performance (p\u200a<\u200a0.05).\nIncreased aerobic capacity and decreased response time (reaction time) resulted in better performance (shorter recorded time) in female student athletes.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are under development for use in diabetic retinopathy photo screening pathways. To be clinically acceptable, such systems must also be able to classify other fundus abnormalities and clinical features at the point of care.\nWe aimed to develop an AI system that can detect several fundus pathologies and report relevant clinical features.\nConvolutional neural network training with retrospective data set.\nColour fundus photos were obtained from publicly available fundus image databases.\nImages were uploaded to a web-based AI platform for training and validation of AI classifiers. Separate classifiers were created for each fundus pathology and clinical feature.\nAccuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for each classifier.\nWe obtained 4435 images from publicly available fundus image databases. AI classifiers were developed for each disease state above. Although statistical performance was limited by the small sample size, average accuracy was 89%, average sensitivity was 75%, average specificity was 89% and average AUC was 0.58.\nThis study is a proof-of-concept AI system that could be implemented within a diabetic photo-screening pathway. Performance was promising but not yet at the level that would be required for clinical application. We have shown that it is possible for clinicians to develop AI classifiers with no previous programming or AI knowledge, using standard laptop computers.",

    "abstract": "Maladaptive interpersonal schemas can trigger distressing emotions and drive dysfunctional behaviour that leads to difficulties in interpersonal relationships and perpetuates the original maladaptive schemas. This study sought to identify patterns of association between trait emotional intelligence (TEI), early maladaptive schemas (EMS), and coping styles in a non-clinical sample. Emotionality profiles were hypothesized to be associated with EMS severity and poorer coping, as early experiences can shape an individual's self-perceptions through reinforcement by maladaptive responses.\nCross-sectional study with 142 undergraduate students.\nWe obtained self-reports of TEI, coping styles, and EMS.\nDisengagement coping was strongly correlated with EMS severity (r\u00a0=\u00a0.565, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01). TEI was negatively correlated with EMS (r\u00a0=\u00a0-.660, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and Disengagement (r\u00a0=\u00a0-.405, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01). Emotionality, Impaired Autonomy, and Overvigilance partially mediated the relationship between Disconnection and Emotion-Focused Disengagement. Self-Control fully mediated the relationship between Impaired Limits and Problem-Focused Disengagement.\nThe findings suggest that lower TEI is associated with the likelihood for maladaptive coping in response to EMS. The preference for certain coping styles associated with a particular domain of EMS may be explained by an individual's perceived metacognitive ability to regulate their stress and emotions. When individuals' needs for love, safety, and acceptance from others are not met, there might be poorer perceived self-efficacies in Emotionality and the tendency to cope through emotional avoidance. Individuals with difficulties establishing internal limits are more likely to respond with problem avoidance, possibly due to deficient distress tolerance. Longitudinal studies with a clinical population are warranted to replicate these findings.\nClinicians will likely find it helpful to consider their clients' TEI to facilitate more individualized formulation and treatment planning, by considering whether related emotional regulation problems might be innate or a deficit in skills Implies the need to do more basic emotional regulation work to supplement and strengthen the established imagery work in schema therapy (ST).",

    "abstract": "Due to the rapid installation of a massive number of fixed and mobile sensors, monitoring machines are intentionally or unintentionally involved in the production of a large amount of geospatial data. Environmental sensors and related software applications are rapidly altering human lifestyles and even impacting ecological and human health. However, there are rarely specific geospatial sensor web (GSW) applications for certain ecological public health questions. In this paper, we propose an ontology-driven approach for integrating intelligence to manage human and ecological health risks in the GSW. We design a Human and Ecological health Risks Ontology (HERO) based on a semantic sensor network ontology template. We also illustrate a web-based prototype, the Human and Ecological Health Risk Management System (HaEHMS), which helps health experts and decision makers to estimate human and ecological health risks. We demonstrate this intelligent system through a case study of automatic prediction of air quality and related health risk.",

    "abstract": "In mountainous regions, rainfall can be extremely variable in space and time. The need to simulate rainfall time series at different scales on one hand and the lack of recording such parameters in small scales because of administrative and economic problems, on the other hand, disaggregation of rainfall time series to the desired scale is an essential topic for hydro-environmental studies of such mountainous regions. Hybrid models development by combining data-driven methods of least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and wavelet decomposition for disaggregation of rainfall time series are the purpose of this paper. In this study, for disaggregating the Tabriz and Sahand rain-gauges time series, according to nonlinear characteristics of observed time scales, wavelet-least square support vector machine (WLSSVM) and wavelet-artificial neural network (WANN) hybrid models were proposed. For this purpose, daily data of four rain-gauges and monthly data of six rain-gauges from mountainous basin of the Urmia Lake for seventeen years were decomposed with wavelet transform and then using mutual information and correlation coefficient criteria, the sub-series were ranked and superior sub-series were used as input data of LSSVM and ANN models for disaggregating the monthly rainfall time series to the daily time series. Results obtained by these hybrid disaggregation models were compared with the results of LSSVM, ANN and classic multiple linear regression (MLR) models. The efficiency of WANN model with regard to the WLSSVM, ANN, LSSVM and MLR models at validation stage in the optimized case for Tabriz rain-gauge showed up to 9.1%, 22%, 20% and 50% increase and in the optimized case for Sahand rain-gauge showed up to 4.5%, 21.1%, 30.2% and 53.3% increase, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing technologies are actively applied in clinical oncology. Bioinformatics pipeline analysis is an integral part of this process; however, humans cannot yet realize the full potential of the highly complex pipeline output. As a result, the decision to include a variant in the final report during routine clinical sign-out remains challenging.\nWe used an artificial intelligence approach to capture the collective clinical sign-out experience of six board-certified molecular pathologists to build and validate a decision support tool for variant reporting. We extracted all reviewed and reported variants from our clinical database and tested several machine learning models. We used 10-fold cross-validation for our variant call prediction model, which derives a contiguous prediction score from 0 to 1 (no to yes) for clinical reporting.\nFor each of the 19,594 initial training variants, our pipeline generates approximately 500 features, which results in a matrix of > 9 million data points. From a comparison of naive Bayes, decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression models, we selected models that allow human interpretability of the prediction score. The logistic regression model demonstrated 1% false negativity and 2% false positivity. The final models' Youden indices were 0.87 and 0.77 for screening and confirmatory cutoffs, respectively. Retraining on a new assay and performance assessment in 16,123 independent variants validated our approach (Youden index, 0.93). We also derived individual pathologist-centric models (virtual consensus conference function), and a visual drill-down functionality allows assessment of how underlying features contributed to a particular score or decision branch for clinical implementation.\nOur decision support tool for variant reporting is a practically relevant artificial intelligence approach to harness the next-generation sequencing bioinformatics pipeline output when the complexity of data interpretation exceeds human capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) enables machines to provide unparalleled value in a myriad of industries and applications. In recent years, researchers have harnessed artificial intelligence to analyze large-volume, unstructured medical data and perform clinical tasks, such as the identification of diabetic retinopathy or the diagnosis of cutaneous malignancies. Applications of artificial intelligence techniques, specifically machine learning and more recently deep learning, are beginning to emerge in gastrointestinal endoscopy. The most promising of these efforts have been in computer-aided detection and computer-aided diagnosis of colorectal polyps, with recent systems demonstrating high sensitivity and accuracy even when compared to expert human endoscopists. AI has also been utilized to identify gastrointestinal bleeding, to detect areas of inflammation, and even to diagnose certain gastrointestinal infections. Future work in the field should concentrate on creating seamless integration of AI systems with current endoscopy platforms and electronic medical records, developing training modules to teach clinicians how to use AI tools, and determining the best means for regulation and approval of new AI technology.",

    "abstract": "The Word Accentuation Test (WAT, Spanish adaptation of the NART) and the Pseudo-Words (PW) Reading subtest from the Battery for Reading Processes Assessment-Revised (PROLEC-R) are measures to estimate premorbid IQ. This study aims to develop demographically calibrated norms for these premorbid measures in a representative sample of the adult Spanish population in terms of age, education, and sex. A sample of 700 healthy participants from 18 to 86 years old completed the WAT and the PW Reading subtest. The effect of age, years of formal education, and sex on WAT total score, PW total score, and time to complete the PW task (PW time) were analyzed. Percentiles and scalar scores were obtained for each raw score according to nine age ranges and individual education levels. The results indicated a significant effect of age and education on the premorbid performance assessed, with no significant effect of sex. Age and education explained from 1.9 to 33.2% of the variance in premorbid IQ variables. Older participants with fewer years of education obtained worse premorbid IQ estimates. This premorbid IQ estimation decline started in the 56-65 age range for WAT total score and PW time, whereas it started in the 71-75 age range for PW total score. This study reports the first demographic-calibrated norms for WAT and PW Reading subtest for Spanish-speaking population. Even though the influence of age and years of education on premorbid IQ measures was confirmed, the PW Reading subtest showed to be more resistant to decline in elderly population than the WAT.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning (DL) has sparked tremendous global interest in recent years. DL has been widely adopted in image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing, but is only beginning to impact on healthcare. In ophthalmology, DL has been applied to fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography and visual fields, achieving robust classification performance in the detection of diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, the glaucoma-like disc, macular oedema and age-related macular degeneration. DL in ocular imaging may be used in conjunction with telemedicine as a possible solution to screen, diagnose and monitor major eye diseases for patients in primary care and community settings. Nonetheless, there are also potential challenges with DL application in ophthalmology, including clinical and technical challenges, explainability of the algorithm results, medicolegal issues, and physician and patient acceptance of the AI 'black-box' algorithms. DL could potentially revolutionise how ophthalmology is practised in the future. This review provides a summary of the state-of-the-art DL systems described for ophthalmic applications, potential challenges in clinical deployment and the path forward.",

    "abstract": "We examined reciprocal, time-ordered associations between age-related changes in fluid intelligence and depressive symptoms. Participants were 1,091 community-dwelling older adults from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study who were assessed repeatedly at 3-year intervals between the ages of 70 and 79 years. On average, fluid intelligence and depressive symptoms worsened with age. There was also a dynamic-coupling effect, in which low fluid intelligence at a given age predicted increasing depressive symptoms across the following 3-year interval, whereas the converse did not hold. Model comparisons showed that this coupling parameter significantly improved overall fit and had a correspondingly moderately strong effect size, accounting on average for an accumulated 0.9 standard-deviation increase in depressive symptoms, following lower cognitive performance, across the observed age range. Adjustment for sociodemographic and health-related covariates did not significantly attenuate this association. This implies that monitoring for cognitive decrements in later life may expedite interventions to reduce related increases in depression risk.",

    "abstract": "One of the most promising areas of health innovation is the application of artificial intelligence (AI), primarily in medical imaging. This article provides basic definitions of terms such as \"machine/deep learning\" and analyses the integration of AI into radiology. Publications on AI have drastically increased from about 100-150 per year in 2007-2008 to 700-800 per year in 2016-2017. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography collectively account for more than 50% of current articles. Neuroradiology appears in about one-third of the papers, followed by musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, breast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and abdomen, each representing 6-9% of articles. With an irreversible increase in the amount of data and the possibility to use AI to identify findings either detectable or not by the human eye, radiology is now moving from a subjective perceptual skill to a more objective science. Radiologists, who were on the forefront of the digital era in medicine, can guide the introduction of AI into healthcare. Yet, they will not be replaced because radiology includes communication of diagnosis, consideration of patient's values and preferences, medical judgment, quality assurance, education, policy-making, and interventional procedures. The higher efficiency provided by AI will allow radiologists to perform more value-added tasks, becoming more visible to patients and playing a vital role in multidisciplinary clinical teams.",

    "abstract": "We determine an optimal injection pattern for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and for the combination of anti-VEGF and unlicensed dendritic cells.\nWe rely on the mathematical model of Soto-Ortiz and Finley (2016) for the interactions between the tumor growth, angiogenesis and immune system reactions. Our optimization algorithm belongs to the class of Monte-Carlo tree search algorithms. The objective consists in finding the minimal total drug doses for which an injection pattern yields tumor eradication.\nOur results are twofold. First, optimized injection protocols enable to significantly reduce the total drug dose for tumor elimination. For instance, for an early diagnosis date, a total dose equal to 58% of the standard anti-VEGF dose enables to eliminate the tumor. In the case of drug combination, associating 25% of the total standard anti-VEGF dose to 10% of the dendritic cell total standard dose eradicates tumor. Our second result is that administering a dose equal to the maximal standard dose allows for later diagnosis date compared to standard protocol. For instance, in the case of anti-VEGF injection, the optimal protocol postpones the maximal diagnosis date by more than one month.\nOverall, our optimization based on artificial intelligence delivers significant gains in total drug administration or in the length of the therapeutic window. Our method is flexible and could be adapted to other drug combinations.",

    "results": "Our results are twofold. First, optimized injection protocols enable to significantly reduce the total drug dose for tumor elimination. For instance, for an early diagnosis date, a total dose equal to 58% of the standard anti-VEGF dose enables to eliminate the tumor. In the case of drug combination, associating 25% of the total standard anti-VEGF dose to 10% of the dendritic cell total standard dose eradicates tumor. Our second result is that administering a dose equal to the maximal standard dose allows for later diagnosis date compared to standard protocol. For instance, in the case of anti-VEGF injection, the optimal protocol postpones the maximal diagnosis date by more than one month.",

    "abstract": "In a mass casualty incident, the factors that determine the survival rate of injured patients are diverse, but one of the key factors is the time for triage. Additionally, the main factor that determines the time of triage is the number of medical personnel. However, when relying on a small number of medical personnel, the ability to increase survivability is limited. Therefore, developing a classification model for survival prediction that can quickly and precisely triage via wearable devices without medical personnel is important. In this study, we designed a consciousness index to substitute the factor by manpower and improved the classification accuracy by applying a machine learning algorithm. First, logistic regression analysis using vital signs and a consciousness index capable of remote monitoring through wearable devices confirmed the high efficiency of the consciousness index. We then developed a classification model with high accuracy which corresponds to existing injury severity scoring systems through the machine learning algorithms. We extracted 460,865 cases which met our criteria for developing the survival prediction from the national sample project in the national trauma databank which contains 408,316 cases of blunt injury and 52,549 cases of penetrating injury. Among the dataset, 17,918 (3.9%) cases died while the other survived. The AUCs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the different models with the proposed simplified consciousness score as follows: RTS (as baseline), 0.78 (95% CI = 0.775 to 0.785); logistic regression, 0.87 (95% CI = 0.862 to 0.870); random forest, 0.87 (95% CI = 0.862 to 0.872); deep neural network, 0.89 (95% CI = 0.882 to 0.890). As a result, we confirmed the possibility of remote triage using a wearable device. It is expected that the time required for triage can be effectively reduced by using the developed classification model of survival prediction.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) has been frequently studied as a predictor of work criteria, but disparate approaches to defining and measuring EI have produced rather inconsistent findings. The conceptualization of EI as an ability to be measured with performance-based tests is by many considered the most appropriate approach, but only few tests developed in this tradition exist, and none of them is designed to specifically assess EI in the workplace. The present research introduces the Geneva Emotional Competence test (GECo)-a new ability EI test measuring emotion recognition (assessed using video clips of actors), emotion understanding, emotion regulation in oneself, and emotion management in others (all assessed with situational judgment items of work-related scenarios). For the situational judgment items, correct and incorrect response options were developed using established theories from the emotion and organizational field. Five studies (total N = 888) showed that all subtests had high measurement precision (as assessed with Item Response Theory), and correlated in expected ways with other EI tests, cognitive intelligence, personality, and demographic variables. Further, the GECo predicted performance in computerized assessment center tasks in a sample of professionals, and explained academic performance in students incrementally above another ability EI test. Because of its theory-based scoring, good psychometric properties, and focus on the workplace, the GECo represents a promising tool for studying the role of four major EI components in organizational outcomes.

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that hydrocephalus in children with myelomeningocele (MMC) can indicate a low intelligence quotient (IQ). Others have argued that it is not the mere presence of hydrocephalus but the superimposition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infections, multiple shunt procedures, and other CNS complications that lead to the lowering of IQ in these patients. In this paper, we review the literature to clarify the information about IQ in patients with MMC and whether it changes after infections and shunt procedures. We have also considered the other factors that could be involved in the IQ development of these patients and the differences revealed by the brain imaging of individuals with MMC. The consensus remains that patients with MMC, with or without complications, tend to have a lower IQ than those without MMC. Hydrocephalus appears to decrease the IQ further in MMC patients. Some have proposed that prenatal repair of the MMC lesion reduces the need for ventricular shunting after birth, thus decreasing the risk of shunt complications such as a CNS infection, which can have a negative effect on IQ. More studies are needed to assess other risk factors (apart from folate deficiency) and genetic factors that could contribute to the development of MMC and their possible effects on patient\u00a0IQ.",

    "abstract": "With much hype about artificial intelligence (AI) rendering radiologists redundant, a simple radiologist-augmented AI\u00a0workflow is evaluated; the premise is that inclusion of a radiologist's opinion into an AI algorithm would make the algorithm achieve better accuracy than an algorithm trained on imaging parameters alone. Open-source BI-RADS data sets were evaluated to see whether inclusion of a radiologist's opinion (in the form of BI-RADS classification) in addition to image parameters improved the accuracy of prediction of histology using three machine learning algorithms vis-\u00e0-vis algorithms using image parameters alone.\nBI-RADS data sets were obtained from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository (data set 1) and the Digital Database for Screening Mammography repository (data set 2); three machine learning algorithms were trained using 10-fold cross-validation. Two sets of models were trained: M1, using lesion shape, margin, density, and patient age for data set 1 and image texture parameters for data set 2, and M2, using the previous image parameters and the BI-RADS classification provided by radiologists. The area under the curve and the Gini coefficient for M1 and M2 were compared for the validation data set.\nThe models using the radiologist-provided BI-RADS classification performed significantly better than the models not using them (P < .0001).\nAI and radiologist working together can achieve better results, helping in case-based decision making. Further evaluation of the metrics involved in predictor handling by AI algorithms will provide newer insights into imaging.",

    "abstract": "Students' gaining and adopting basic professional values, improving their emotional intelligence skills during the process of nursing education plays a significant role on meeting the needs of healthy/patient individual and his or her family, and individualized care practices.\nThis (descriptive, correlational) research was carried out to evaluate the nursing values, emotional intelligence levels, and individualized care perceptions of senior nursing students and to determine the relationship between them.\n(1) What is the status of students to adopt nursing values? (2) What is the level of students' emotional intelligence? (3) What is the students' individualized care perception? (4) Is there a relationship between students' nursing values, levels of emotional intelligence, and individualized perceptions of care?\nThe research was carried out with 218 senior nursing students at the Faculty of Nursing, affiliated to a state university in Istanbul, who agreed to participate in the study, completing basic nursing education in May 2017.\nEthical approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Clinical Investigations of the Istanbul University Dentistry Faculty. Written permission was also obtained from the institution that research would be conducted. Before the data were collected, verbal permission was obtained by the investigator.\nIt was observed that nursing values perceptions of students, emotional intelligence levels and individualized care perceptions were at a good level and there was a supportive relationship between them in the positive direction. It was determined that emotional intelligence skills of students, adoption of nursing values and individualized care perceptions increased in parallel with each other.\nIn nursing education, nursing values peculiar to affective field, caring behaviors, and emotional intelligence skills that are guiding to maintain and direct these behaviors should be gained to students by supporting with correct learning methods and role models.",

    "abstract": "Vascular dementia (VD) is a commonly-seen disease in the elderly. What is more, \"Acupuncture at 3-points for intelligence\" is one of the most important components of \"Jin's three-needle therapy\" created by Rui Jin, a professor of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, which can be used in the VD patients. In this article, researchers will assess the clinical efficacy and safety of acupuncture at 3-points for intelligence in the treatment of VD.\nA systematic literature search for articles up to September 2018 will be conducted using 9 databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, CBM, VIP, Wanfang database, OASIS, and CiNii. Inclusion criteria are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture at 3-points for intelligence on treating VD. The primary outcome measures will be scores reflecting the neurological function of participants based on common medical scales. Hemorheology indexes, homocysteine (Hcy), acetylcholine (Ach), nitric oxide (NO), and adverse events will also be assessed. Stata V.13.0 software will be used for data synthesis, sensitivity analysis, meta-regression, subgroup analysis, and risk of bias assessment. A funnel plot will be developed to evaluate reporting bias. Egger and Begg tests will be further performed to conduct quantitative evaluation of publication bias and to evaluate the symmetry of funnel plot. We will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system to assess the quality of evidence.\nThe results of this systematic review and meta-analysis will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\nOur study will provide the evidence for the clinical efficacy and safety of acupuncture at 3-points for intelligence in the treatment of VD.",

    "abstract": "An understanding of the basics concepts of deep learning can be helpful in not only understanding the potential applications of this technique but also in critically reviewing literature in which neural networks are utilized for analysis and modeling.\nThe term \"deep learning\" has been applied to a subset of machine learning that utilizes a \"neural network\" and is often used interchangeably with \"artificial intelligence.\" It has been increasingly utilized in healthcare for computational \"learning\", especially for pattern recognition for diagnostic imaging. Another promising application is the potential for these neural networks to improve the accuracy in the identification of patients who are at risk for cardiovascular events and could benefit most from preventive treatment in comparison with more conventional statistical techniques. The importance of such tailored cardiovascular risk assessment and disease management in individual patients is far reaching given that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Nearly half of myocardial infarctions and strokes occur in patients who are not predicted to be at risk for cardiovascular events by current guideline-based approaches. Equally important are individuals who are not at risk for cardiovascular events and yet are given expensive and unnecessary preventive treatment with potential untoward side effects. The application of powerful artificial intelligence/deep learning tools in medicine is likely to result in more effective and efficient health care delivery with the potential for significant cost savings by shifting preventative treatment from inappropriate to appropriate patient subgroups.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly becoming the most talked about and controversial topics in radiology and medicine. Over the past few years, the numbers of ML- or AI-focused studies in the literature have increased almost exponentially, and ML has become a hot topic at academic and industry conferences. However, despite the increased awareness of ML as a tool, many medical professionals have a poor understanding of how ML works and how to critically appraise studies and tools that are presented to us. Thus, we present a brief overview of ML, explain the metrics used in ML and how to interpret them, and explain some of the technical jargon associated with the field so that readers with a medical background and basic knowledge of statistics can feel more comfortable when examining ML applications.\nAttention to sample size, overfitting, underfitting, cross validation, as well as a broad knowledge of the metrics of machine learning, can help those with little or no technical knowledge begin to assess machine learning studies. However, transparency in methods and sharing of algorithms is vital to allow clinicians to assess these tools themselves.",

This paper first describes the four core elements of today's digital power concentration, which need to be seen in cumulation and which, seen together, are both a threat to democracy and to functioning markets. It then recalls the experience with the lawless Internet and the relationship between technology and the law as it has developed in the Internet economy and the experience with GDPR before it moves on to the key question for AI in democracy, namely which of the challenges of AI can be safely and with good conscience left to ethics, and which challenges of AI need to be addressed by rules which are enforceable and encompass the legitimacy of democratic process, thus laws. The paper closes with a call for a new culture of incorporating the principles of democracy, rule of law and human rights by design in AI and a three-level technological impact assessment for new technologies like AI as a practical way forward for this purpose.This article is part of a theme issue 'Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges'.",

The country's regional influence, burgeoning AI industry and ambitious governmental initiatives around AI make it an important jurisdiction to consider, regardless of where the reader of this article lives. Even as existing policy processes intend to encourage the rapid development of AI for economic growth and social good, an overarching trend persists in India, and several other jurisdictions: the limitations and risks of data-driven decisions still feature as retrospective considerations for development and deployment of AI applications. This article argues that the technical limitations of AI systems should be reckoned with at the time of developing policy, and the societal and ethical concerns that arise due to such limitations should be used to ",

    "abstract": "This paper is the introduction to the special issue entitled: 'Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal and technical opportunities and challenges'. Artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly permeates every aspect of our society, from the critical, like urban infrastructure, law enforcement, banking, healthcare and humanitarian aid, to the mundane like dating. AI, including embodied AI in robotics and techniques like machine learning, can improve economic, social welfare and the exercise of human rights. Owing to the proliferation of AI in high-risk areas, the pressure is mounting to design and govern AI to be accountable, fair and transparent. How can this be achieved and through which frameworks? This is one of the central questions addressed in this special issue, in which eight authors present in-depth analyses of the ethical, legal-regulatory and technical challenges posed by developing governance regimes for AI systems. It also gives a brief overview of recent developments in AI governance, how much of the agenda for defining AI regulation, ethical frameworks and technical approaches is set, as well as providing some concrete suggestions to further the debate on AI governance.This article is part of the theme issue 'Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges'.",

We apply this method to the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data Set (WBCD), the Mammographic Mass Data Set, and the Dermatology Dataset, which are small, high-abstraction data sets with prior knowledge. After training these three data sets, our proposed rule extraction method was able to extract accurate and concise rules for deep NNs trained by a DBN. These results suggest that our proposed method could help fill the gap between the very high learning capability of DBNs and the very high interpretability of rule extraction algorithms such as Re-RX with J48graft.",

Premorbid intelligence quotient was estimated using the Japanese Adult Reading Test and distress symptoms were assessed using the Hopkins Symptom Check List. Current smoking information was collected according to self-declarations.\nAs expected, the smoking rate was higher, while mean education level and Japanese Adult Reading Test scores were significantly lower, in patients with schizophrenia than in healthy individuals (\nOur results suggest that lower estimated premorbid intelligence quotient is an important variable in elucidating smoking behavior in humans and may be associated with higher prevalence of smoking in patients with schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Using machine learning, targets were identified for \u03b2-lapachone. Resorting to biochemical assays, \u03b2-lapachone was validated as a potent, ligand efficient, allosteric and reversible modulator of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). Moreover, we provide a rationale for 5-LO modulation and show that inhibition of 5-LO is relevant for the anticancer activity of \u03b2-lapachone. This work demonstrates the power of machine intelligence to deconvolute complex phenotypes, as an alternative and/or complement to chemoproteomics and as a viable general approach for systems pharmacology studies.",

    "abstract": "US physicians are experiencing burnout in alarming numbers. However, doctors with high levels of emotional intelligence (EI) may be immune to burnout, as they possess coping strategies which make them more resilient and better at managing stress. Educating physicians in EI may help prevent burnout and optimize their overall wellness. The purpose of our study was to determine if educational intervention increases the overall EI level of residents; specifically, their stress management and wellness scores.\nResidents from pediatrics and med-ped residency programs at a university-based training program volunteered to complete an online self-report EI survey (EQ-i 2.0) before and after an educational intervention. The four-hour educational workshop focused on developing four EI skills: self-awareness; self-management; social awareness; and social skills. We compared de-identified median score reports for the residents as a cohort before and after the intervention.\nThirty-one residents (20 pediatric and 11 med-ped residents) completed the EI survey at both time intervals and were included in the analysis of results. We saw a significant increase in total EI median scores before and after educational intervention (110 vs 114, \nAs a group, our pediatric and med-peds residents had a significant increase in total EI and several other components of EI following an educational intervention. Teaching EI skills related to the areas of self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and social skill may improve stress management skills, promote wellness, and prevent burnout in resident physicians.",

    "abstract": "The incidence, risk factors and survival impact of secondary primary malignancies (SPMs) among survivors of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with definitive intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy are poorly characterized.\nConsecutive patients (n=6,377) from the big-data intelligence platform at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, China (in a high-incidence area) with newly diagnosed non-metastatic pathologically proven non-keratinizing undifferentiated NPC treated with IMRT\u00b1chemotherapy between January 2003 and June 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Cumulative incidence of SPMs was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify potential risk factors for SPMs and assess whether SPMs affect overall survival.\nOf the 6,377 patients, 189 (3.0%) suffered SPMs (median follow-up, 62 months). One-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-cumulative risks of SPMs were 0.4%, 0.9%, 1.6%, 2.2%, and 2.6%, respectively. Latency from start of IMRT to SPMs diagnosis was 37 months (range, 6 to 102 months).

Multivariate analysis demonstrated sex (male, 64% increase), age (\u226550 years, 68% increase), and smoking history (41% increase) were significant risk factors for SPMs, and SPMs were associated with poorer overall survival.\nThis large cohort study confirms SPMs a dreadful complication for long-term survivors of NPC treated with IMRT.

    "abstract": "Automation of pharmaceutical safety case processing represents a significant opportunity to affect the strongest cost driver for a company's overall pharmacovigilance budget. A pilot was undertaken to test the feasibility of using artificial intelligence and robotic process automation to automate processing of adverse event reports. The pilot paradigm was used to simultaneously test proposed solutions of three commercial vendors. The result confirmed the feasibility of using artificial intelligence-based technology to support extraction from adverse event source documents and evaluation of case validity. In addition, the pilot demonstrated viability of the use of safety database data fields as a surrogate for otherwise time-consuming and costly direct annotation of source documents. Finally, the evaluation and scoring method used in the pilot was able to differentiate vendor capabilities and identify the best candidate to move into the discovery phase.",

    "abstract": "Age has been shown to have an impact on both grey (GM) and white matter (WM) volume, with a steeper slope of age-related decline in schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. In schizophrenia, the relation between age and brain volume is further complicated by factors such as lower intelligence, antipsychotic medication, and cannabis use, all of which have been shown to have independent effects on brain volume. In a study of first-episode, antipsychotic-na\u00efve schizophrenia patients (N\u202f=\u202f54) and healthy controls (N\u202f=\u202f56), we examined the effects of age on whole brain measures of GM and WM volume, and whether these relationships were moderated by schizophrenia and intelligence (IQ). Secondarily, we examined lifetime cannabis use as a moderator of the relationship between age and brain volume. Schizophrenia patients had lower GM volumes than healthy controls but did not differ on WM volume. We found an age effect on GM indicating that increasing age was associated with lower GM volumes, which did not differ between groups. IQ did not have a direct effect on GM, but showed a trend-level interaction with age, suggesting a greater impact of age with lower IQ. There were no age effects on WM volume, but a direct effect of IQ, with higher IQ showing an association with larger WM volume. Lifetime cannabis use did not alter these findings significantly. This study points to effects of schizophrenia on GM early in the illness, before antipsychotic treatment is initiated, suggesting that WM changes may occur later in the disease process.",

    "abstract": "In the course of digitalization it is becoming increasingly rare for medical documents to be handwritten. As a\u00a0result, digitalization has already become an integral part of routine patient care but in contrast to other specialist disciplines, such as radiology or laboratory medicine, orthopedics and trauma surgery are still at the beginning of new technologies. Artificial intelligence is not only used in the form of surgical robots in joint surgery or in the design of individualized implants but also provides valuable decision-making aids through appropriate algorithms for diagnosis and treatment. It can be assumed that these technologies will be further developed and used increasingly more in the coming years. Typical examples are intuitively operable and autonomously working programs and systems that support the networking and work of medical personnel and make processes inside and outside inpatient care more precise and less vulnerable to disturbances.",

    "abstract": "Eye movement studies are subject of interest in human cognition. Cortical activity and cognitive load impress eye movement influentially. Here, we investigated whether fluid intelligence (FI) has any effect on eye movement pattern in a comparative visual search (CVS) task. FI of individuals was measured using the Cattell test, and participants were divided into three groups: low FI, middle FI, and high FI. Eye movements of individuals were then recorded during the CVS task. Eye movement patterns were extracted and compared statistically among the three groups. Our experiment demonstrated that eye movement patterns were significantly different among the three groups. Pearson correlation coefficients between FI and eye movement parameters were also calculated to assess which of the eye movement parameters were most affected by FI. Our findings illustrate that saccade peak velocity had the greatest positive correlation with FI score and the ratio of total fixation duration to total saccade duration had the greatest negative correlation with FI. Next, we extracted 24 features from eye movement patterns and designed: (1) a classifier to categorize individuals and (2) a regression analysis to predict the FI score of individuals. In the best case examined, the classifier categorized subjects with 68.3% accuracy, and the regression predicted FI of individuals with a 0.54 correlation between observed FI and predicted FI. In our investigation, the results have emphasized that imposed loads on low FI individuals is greater than that of high FI individuals in the cognitive load tasks.",

    "abstract": "Nodal metastasis of a primary tumor influences therapy decisions for a variety of cancers. Histologic identification of tumor cells in lymph nodes can be laborious and error-prone, especially for small tumor foci.\nTo evaluate the application and clinical implementation of a state-of-the-art deep learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm (LYmph Node Assistant or LYNA) for detection of metastatic breast cancer in sentinel lymph node biopsies.\nWhole slide images were obtained from hematoxylin-eosin-stained lymph nodes from 399 patients (publicly available Camelyon16 challenge dataset). LYNA was developed by using 270 slides and evaluated on the remaining 129 slides. We compared the findings to those obtained from an independent laboratory (108 slides from 20 patients/86 blocks) using a different scanner to measure reproducibility.\nLYNA achieved a slide-level area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 99% and a tumor-level sensitivity of 91% at 1 false positive per patient on the Camelyon16 evaluation dataset. We also identified 2 \"normal\" slides that contained micrometastases. When applied to our second dataset, LYNA achieved an AUC of 99.6%. LYNA was not affected by common histology artifacts such as overfixation, poor staining, and air bubbles.\nArtificial intelligence algorithms can exhaustively evaluate every tissue patch on a slide, achieving higher tumor-level sensitivity than, and comparable slide-level performance to, pathologists. These techniques may improve the pathologist's productivity and reduce the number of false negatives associated with morphologic detection of tumor cells. We provide a framework to aid practicing pathologists in assessing such algorithms for adoption into their workflow (akin to how a pathologist assesses immunohistochemistry results).",

    "abstract": "Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) from the clandestine intelligence sector are being increasingly employed in infectious disease outbreaks. The purpose of this article is to explore how such tools might be employed in the detection, reporting, and control of outbreaks designated as a 'threat' by the global community. It is also intended to analyse previous use of such tools during the Ebola and SARS epidemics and to discuss key questions regarding the ethics and legality of initiatives that further blur the military and humanitarian spaces.\nWe undertake qualitative analysis of current discussions on OSINT and SIGINT and their intersection with global health. We also review current literature and describe the debates. We built on quantitative and qualitative research done into current health collection capabilities.\nThis article presents an argument for the use of OSINT in the detection of infectious disease outbreaks and how this might occur.\nWe conclude that there is a place for OSINT and SIGINT in the detection and reporting of outbreaks. However, such tools are not sufficient on their own and must be corroborated for the intelligence to be relevant and actionable. Finally, we conclude that further discussion on key ethical issues needs to take place before such research can continue. In particular, this involves questions of jurisdiction, data ownership, and ethical considerations.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is the most expensive chronic disease in the United States. Two-thirds of US adults have prediabetes or are overweight and at risk for type 2 diabetes. Intensive in-person behavioral counseling can help patients lose weight and make healthy behavior changes to improve their health outcomes. However, with the shortage of health care providers and associated costs, such programs do not adequately service all patients who could benefit. The health care system needs effective and cost-effective interventions that can lead to positive health outcomes as scale. This study investigated the ability of conversational artificial intelligence (AI), in the form of a standalone, fully automated text-based mobile coaching service, to promote weight loss and other health behaviors related to diabetes prevention. This study also measured user acceptability of AI coaches as alternatives to live health care professionals.\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate weight loss, changes in meal quality, and app acceptability among users of the Lark Weight Loss Health Coach AI (HCAI), with the overarching goal of increasing access to compassionate health care via mobile health. Lessons learned in this study can be applied when planning future clinical trials to evaluate HCAI and when designing AI to promote weight loss, healthy behavior change, and prevention and self-management of chronic diseases.\nThis was a longitudinal observational study among overweight and obese (body mass index \u226525) participants who used HCAI, which encourages weight loss and healthy diet choices through elements of cognitive behavioral therapy. Weight loss, meal quality, physical activity, and sleep data were collected through user input and, for sleep and physical activity, partly through automatic detection by the user's mobile phone. User engagement was assessed by duration and amount of app use. A 4-question in-app user trust survey assessed app usability and acceptability.\nData were analyzed for participants (N=70) who met engagement standards set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for Diabetes Prevention Program, a clinically proven weight loss program focused on preventing diabetes. Weight loss (standard error of the mean) was 2.38% (0.69%) of baseline weight. The average duration of app use was 15 (SD 1.0) weeks, and users averaged 103 sessions each. Predictors of weight loss included duration of AI use, number of counseling sessions, and number of meals logged. Percentage of healthy meals increased by 31%. The in-app user trust survey had a 100% response rate and positive results, with a satisfaction score of 87 out of 100 and net promoter score of 47.\nThis study showed that use of an AI health coach is associated with weight loss comparable to in-person lifestyle interventions. It can also encourage behavior changes and have high user acceptability. Research into AI and its application in telemedicine should be pursued, with clinical trials investigating effects on weight, health behaviors, and user engagement and acceptability.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in drug discovery. In particular artificial neural networks such as deep neural networks or recurrent networks drive this area. Numerous applications in property or activity predictions like physicochemical and ADMET properties have recently appeared and underpin the strength of this technology in quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) or quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). Artificial intelligence in de novo design drives the generation of meaningful new biologically active molecules towards desired properties. Several examples establish the strength of artificial intelligence in this field. Combination with synthesis planning and ease of synthesis is feasible and more and more automated drug discovery by computers is expected in the near future.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a proof-of-concept study in artificial-intelligence-assisted (AI-assisted) chemistry where a machine-learning-based molecule generator is coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, synthesis, and measurement. Although deep-learning-based molecule generators have shown promise, it is unclear to what extent they can be useful in real-world materials development. To assess the reliability of AI-assisted chemistry, we prepared a platform using a molecule generator and a DFT simulator, and attempted to generate novel photofunctional molecules whose lowest excited states lie at desired energetic levels. A 10 day run on the 12-core server discovered 86 potential photofunctional molecules around target lowest excitation levels, designated as 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 nm. Among the molecules discovered, six were synthesized, and five were confirmed to reproduce DFT predictions in ultraviolet visible absorption measurements. This result shows the potential of AI-assisted chemistry to discover ready-to-synthesize novel molecules with modest computational resources.",

Recent advances in AI/ML fields have made an impact on imaging and image analysis across the board, from microscopy to radiology. AI has been an active field of research since the 1950s; however, for most of this period, algorithms achieved subhuman performance and were not broadly adopted in medicine. Recent enhancements for computational hardware is enabling researchers to revisit old AI algorithms and experiment with new mathematical ideas. Researchers are applying these methods to a broad array of medical technologies, ranging from microscopic image analysis to tomographic image reconstruction and diagnostic planning.",

    "abstract": "PubMed is a widely used search engine for biomedical literature. It is developed and maintained by the US National Library of Medicine/National Center for Biotechnology Information and is visited daily by millions of users around the world. For decades, PubMed has used advanced artificial intelligence technologies that extract patterns of collective user activity, such as machine learning and natural language processing, to inform the algorithmic changes that ultimately improve a user's search experience. Although these efforts have led to objective improvements in search quality, the technical underpinnings remain largely invisible and go largely unnoticed by most users. Here we describe how these 'under-the-hood' techniques work within PubMed and report how their effectiveness and usage is assessed in real-world scenarios. In doing so, we hope to increase the transparency of the PubMed system and enable users to make more effective use of the search engine. We also identify open challenges and new opportunities for computational researchers to explore the potential of future improvements.",

    "abstract": "Lacking quantitative evaluations of competing risk data of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), we aimed to evaluate the probability of NPC- and other cause-specific mortality (NPC-SM; OCSM) and develop competing risk nomograms to quantify survival differences.\nUsing the institutional big-data intelligence platform, 7251 NPC patients undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy between 2009-2014 were identified to establish nomograms based on Fine and Gray's competing risk analysis.\nThe 5-year NPC-SM and OCSM of the cohort were 13.1% and 1.2%, respectively, and elevated 5-year OCSMs were observed in patients aged \u226565\u202fyears (5.5%) or with severe comorbidities (4.3%). Age was most predictive of OCSM: patients aged 55-64 and \u226565\u202fyears exhibited subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs) of 2.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.64-4.4; P\u202f<\u202f.001) and 5.78 (95% CI, 3.32-10.08; P\u202f<\u202f.001), respectively. Comorbidity measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was also strongly predictive of OCSM: patients with CCI scores of 1 and \u22652 exhibited SHRs of 2.33 (95% CI, 1.46-3.71; P\u202f<\u202f.001) and 2.58 (95% CI, 1.16-5.73; P\u202f=\u202f.020), respectively. All validated factors were integrated into the competing nomograms: age, sex, histology type, tumor and node stages, plasma Epstein-Barr virus-DNA level, lactate dehydrogenase level, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level into the NPC-SM model (concordance [c]-index\u202f=\u202f0.743); and age, CCI, Albumin level, and CRP level into the OCSM model (c-index\u202f=\u202f0.793).\nOCSM represents a significant competing event for NPC-SM in elderly patients and patients with comorbidities.

    "abstract": "Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are episodes of paroxysmal impairment associated with a range of motor, sensory, and mental manifestations, which perfectly mimic epileptic seizures. Several patterns of neural abnormalities have been described without identifying a definite neurobiological substrate. In this multicenter cross-sectional study, we applied a multivariate classification algorithm on morphological brain imaging metrics to extract reliable biomarkers useful to distinguish patients from controls at an individual level. Twenty-three patients with PNES and 21 demographically matched healthy controls (HC) underwent an extensive neuropsychiatric/neuropsychological and neuroimaging assessment. One hundred and fifty morphological brain metrics were used for training a random forest (RF) machine-learning (ML) algorithm. A typical complex psychopathological construct was observed in PNES. Similarly, univariate neuroimaging analysis revealed widespread neuroanatomical changes affecting patients with PNES. Machine-learning approach, after feature selection, was able to perform an individual classification of PNES from controls with a mean accuracy of 74.5%, revealing that brain regions influencing classification accuracy were mainly localized within the limbic (posterior cingulate and insula) and motor inhibition systems (the right inferior frontal cortex (IFC)). This study provides Class II evidence that the considerable clinical and neurobiological heterogeneity observed in individuals with PNES might be overcome by ML algorithms trained on surface-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.",

    "abstract": "In the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), an incremental benefit of achieving histologic healing beyond that of endoscopic mucosal healing has been suggested; persistent histologic inflammation increases the risk of exacerbation and dysplasia. However, identification of persistent histologic inflammation is extremely difficult using conventional endoscopy. Furthermore, the reproducibility of endoscopic disease activity is poor. We developed and evaluated a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to predict persistent histologic inflammation using endocytoscopy (EC; 520-fold ultra-magnifying endoscope).\nWe evaluated the accuracy of the CAD system using test image sets. First, we retrospectively reviewed the data of 187 patients with UC from whom biopsy samples were obtained after endocytoscopic observation. EC images and biopsy samples of each patient were collected from 6 colorectal segments: cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. All EC images were tagged with reference to the biopsy sample's histologic activity. For validation samples, 525 validation sets of 525 independent segments were collected from 100 patients, and 12,900 EC images from the remaining 87 patients were used for machine learning to construct CAD. The primary outcome measure was the diagnostic ability of CAD to predict persistent histologic inflammation. Its reproducibility for all test images was also assessed.\nCAD provided diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy as follows: 74% (95% confidence interval, 65%-81%), 97% (95% confidence interval, 95%-99%), and 91% (95% confidence interval, 83%-95%), respectively. Its reproducibility was perfect (\u03ba\u00a0= 1).\nOur CAD system potentially allows fully automated identification of persistent histologic inflammation associated with UC.",

    "abstract": "Behavioural investigation has become increasingly more focused on emotional intelligence as researchers strive to understand its influence on various social interactions. Recent research indicates that EI plays an integral role in adopting active and effective coping strategies. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between emotional intelligence and coping strategies in patients with schizophrenia.\nThe research included 102 stable patients with ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia. The sample consisted of 46 (45.1%) female and 56 (54.9%) male patients, in the 18-55 age range (M=35.54; sd=10.48). All the participants completed the Questionnaire of Emotional Intelligence and Competence (UEK-45) and the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS).\nData were analysed using the correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis. The results showed that emotional intelligence correlates significantly with both task-oriented and avoidance-oriented strategies (including social diversion and distraction). Regression analysis revealed that emotional intelligence can be a significant predictor for these two coping strategies (task-oriented and avoidance-oriented strategies (including social diversion and distraction)).\nPatients with lower emotional intelligence mainly use strategies focused on coping with their own emotions. These results may prompt the devising of prevention and treatment programs for patients suffering from schizophrenia. Namely, numerous studies and research on emotional intelligence show that emotional intelligence can be enhanced through learning and behaviour modification at any age.",

    "abstract": "Despite evidence that variation exists between individuals in high-stakes truth and deception detection accuracy rates, little work has investigated what differences in individuals' cognitive and emotional abilities contribute to this variation. Our study addressed this question by examining the role played by cognitive and affective theory of mind (ToM), emotional intelligence (EI), and various aspects of attention (alerting, orienting, executive control) in explaining variation in accuracy rates among 115 individuals (87 women; mean age = 27.04 years [ SD = 11.32]) who responded to video clips of truth-tellers and liars in real-world, high-stakes contexts. Faster attentional alerting supported truth detection, and better cognitive ToM and perception of emotion (an aspect of EI) supported deception detection. This evidence indicates that truth and deception detection are distinct constructs supported by different abilities. Future research may address whether interventions targeting these cognitive and emotional traits can also contribute to improving detection skill.",

    "abstract": "Recent research on emotions in aging points to emotional intelligence (EI) as a factor that plays an important role in this process, and different conceptualizations of EI show that this construct is closely linked to personality in the general population. The main purpose of this study was to find out whether findings obtained in the general population indicating a predictive relationship between personality and EI are also confirmed during the aging process. A sample of 233 healthy older subjects between 60 and 90\u2009years old was used. Participants answered two self-report scales on EI and personality, respectively. Structural equation modeling was used to test the predictive role of personality in EI. Personality was found to be a predictor of EI in older people, and the weight of the prediction was significant in all the dimensions of the big five personality factors, except the dimension of neuroticism, which is known to vary greatly during the aging process. These results indicate that personality influences EI differently in the older adult population, compared to the general population. This is a relevant finding that should be examined further in order to better understand the influence of personality on positive emotional development in this population.",

    "abstract": "Land leveling is one of the most important steps in soil preparation and cultivation. Although land leveling with machines require considerable amount of energy, it delivers a suitable surface slope with minimal deterioration of the soil and damage to plants and other organisms in the soil. Notwithstanding, researchers during recent years have tried to reduce fossil fuel consumption and its deleterious side effects. The aim of this work was to determine best linear model using artificial neural network (ANN), imperialist competitive algorithm and ANN and regression and adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in order to predict the environmental indicators for land leveling.\nNew techniques such as; ANN, imperialist competitive algorithm and ANN and sensitivity analysis and regression and ANFIS that will lead to a noticeable improvement in the environment. In this research effects of various soil properties such as embankment volume, soil compressibility factor, specific gravity, moisture content, slope, sand percent, and soil swelling index in energy consumption were investigated. The study was consisted of 90 samples were collected from 3 different regions. The grid size was set 20\u00a0m in 20\u00a0m (20\u2009\u00d7\u200920) from a farmland in Karaj province of Iran.\nAccording to the results of sensitivity analysis, only three parameters; density, soil compressibility factor and, embankment volume index had significant effect on fuel consumption. In comparison with ANN, all ICA-ANN models had higher accuracy in prediction according to their higher R\nResults extracted and statistical analysis was performed and RMSE as well as coefficient of determination, R",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is developing quickly in the medical field and can benefit both medical staff and patients. The clinical decision support system Watson for Oncology (WFO) is an outstanding representative AI in the medical field, and it can provide to cancer patients prompt treatment recommendations comparable with ones made by expert oncologists. WFO is increasingly being used in China, but limited reports on whether WFO is suitable for Chinese patients, especially patients with lung cancer, exist. Here, we report a retrospective study based on the consistency between the lung cancer treatment recommendations made for the same patient by WFO and by the multidisciplinary team at our center.\nThe aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of using WFO for lung cancer cases in China and to ascertain ways to make WFO more suitable for Chinese patients with lung cancer.\nWe selected all lung cancer patients who were hospitalized and received antitumor treatment for the first time at the Second Xiangya Hospital Cancer Center from September to December 2017 (N=182). WFO made treatment recommendations for all supported cases (n=149). If the actual therapeutic regimen (administered by our multidisciplinary team) was recommended or for consideration according to WFO, we defined the recommendations as consistent; if the actual therapeutic regimen was not recommended by WFO or if WFO did not provide the same treatment option, we defined the recommendations as inconsistent. Blinded second round reviews were performed by our multidisciplinary team to reassess the incongruent cases.\nWFO did not support 18.1% (33/182) of recommendations among all cases. Of the 149 supported cases, 65.8% (98/149) received recommendations that were consistent with the recommendations of our team. Logistic regression analysis showed that pathological type and staging had significant effects on consistency (P=.004, odds ratio [OR] 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.45 and P<.001, OR 9.5, 95% CI 3.4-26.1, respectively). Age, gender, and presence of epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations had no effect on consistency. In 82% (42/51) of the inconsistent cases, our team administered two China-specific treatments, which were different from the recommendations made by WFO but led to excellent outcomes.\nIn China, most of the treatment recommendations of WFO are consistent with the recommendations of the expert group, although a relatively high proportion of cases are still not supported by WFO. Therefore, WFO cannot currently replace oncologists. WFO can improve the efficiency of clinical work by providing assistance to doctors, but it needs to learn the regional characteristics of patients to improve its assistive ability.",

    "abstract": "An estimated 425 million people globally have diabetes, accounting for 12% of the world's health expenditures, and yet 1 in 2 persons remain undiagnosed and untreated. Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive computing offer promise in diabetes care. The purpose of this article is to better understand what AI advances may be relevant today to persons with diabetes (PWDs), their clinicians, family, and caregivers. The authors conducted a predefined, online PubMed search of publicly available sources of information from 2009 onward using the search terms \"diabetes\" and \"artificial intelligence.\" The study included clinically-relevant, high-impact articles, and excluded articles whose purpose was technical in nature. A total of 450 published diabetes and AI articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies represent a diverse and complex set of innovative approaches that aim to transform diabetes care in 4 main areas: automated retinal screening, clinical decision support, predictive population risk stratification, and patient self-management tools. Many of these new AI-powered retinal imaging systems, predictive modeling programs, glucose sensors, insulin pumps, smartphone applications, and other decision-support aids are on the market today with more on the way. AI applications have the potential to transform diabetes care and help millions of PWDs to achieve better blood glucose control, reduce hypoglycemic episodes, and reduce diabetes comorbidities and complications. AI applications offer greater accuracy, efficiency, ease of use, and satisfaction for PWDs, their clinicians, family, and caregivers.",

    "abstract": "A current challenge in osteoporosis is identifying patients at risk of bone fracture.\nTo identify the machine learning classifiers that predict best osteoporotic bone fractures and, from the data, to highlight the imaging features and the anatomical regions that contribute most to prediction performance.\nProspective (cross-sectional) case-control study.\nThirty-two women with prior fragility bone fractures, of mean age\u2009=\u200961.6 and body mass index (BMI)\u2009=\u200922.7\u2009kg/m\nQuantitative MRI outcomes by software algorithms. Mechanical and topological microstructural parameters of the trabecular bone were calculated for five femoral regions, and added to the vector of features together with bone mineral density measurement, fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) score, and personal characteristics such as age, weight, and height. We fitted 15 classifiers using 200 randomized cross-validation datasets. Statistical Tests: Data: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality. Model Performance: sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, F1-test, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Two-sided t-test, with P < 0.05 for statistical significance.\nThe top three performing classifiers are RUS-boosted trees (in particular, performing best with head data, F1\u2009=\u20090.64\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03), the logistic regression and the linear discriminant (both best with trochanteric datasets, F1\u2009=\u20090.65\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 and F1\u2009=\u20090.67\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03, respectively). A permutation of these classifiers comprised the best three performers for four out of five anatomical datasets. After averaging across all the anatomical datasets, the score for the best performer, the boosted trees, was F1\u2009=\u20090.63\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 for All-features dataset, F1\u2009=\u20090.52\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05 for the no-MRI dataset, and F1\u2009=\u20090.48\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06 for the no-FRAX dataset. Data Conclusion: Of many classifiers, the RUS-boosted trees, the logistic regression, and the linear discriminant are best for predicting osteoporotic fracture. Both MRI and FRAX independently add value in identifying osteoporotic fractures. The femoral head, greater trochanter, and inter-trochanter anatomical regions within the proximal femur yielded better F1-scores for the best three classifiers.\n2 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J.

A permutation of these classifiers comprised the best three performers for four out of five anatomical datasets. After averaging across all the anatomical datasets, the score for the best performer, the boosted trees, was F1\u2009=\u20090.63\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 for All-features dataset, F1\u2009=\u20090.52\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05 for the no-MRI dataset, and F1\u2009=\u20090.48\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06 for the no-FRAX dataset. Data Conclusion: Of many classifiers, the RUS-boosted trees, the logistic regression, and the linear discriminant are best for predicting osteoporotic fracture. Both MRI and FRAX independently add value in identifying osteoporotic fractures. The femoral head, greater trochanter, and inter-trochanter anatomical regions within the proximal femur yielded better F1-scores for the best three classifiers.",

    "abstract": "Standardized clinical pathways are useful tool to reduce variation in clinical management and may improve quality of care. However the evidence supporting a specific clinical pathway for a patient or patient population is often imperfect limiting adoption and efficacy of clinical pathway. Machine intelligence can potentially identify clinical variation and may provide useful insights to create and optimize clinical pathways. In this quality improvement project we analyzed the inpatient care of 1786 patients undergoing colorectal surgery from 2015 to 2016 across multiple Ohio hospitals in the Cleveland Clinic System. Data from four information subsystems was loaded in the Clinical Variation Management (CVM) application (Ayasdi, Inc., Menlo Park, CA). The CVM application uses machine intelligence and topological data analysis methods to identify groups of similar patients based on the treatment received. We defined \"favorable performance\" as groups with lower direct variable cost, lower length of stay, and lower 30-day readmissions. The software auto-generated 9 distinct groups of patients based on similarity analysis. Overall, favorable performance was seen with ketorolac use, lower intra-operative fluid use (<\u20092000\u00a0cc) and surgery for cancer. Multiple sub-groups were easily created and analyzed. Adherence reporting tools were easy to use enabling almost real time monitoring. Machine intelligence provided useful insights to create and monitor care pathways with several advantages over traditional analytic approaches including: (1) analysis across disparate data sets, (2) unsupervised discovery, (3) speed and auto-generation of clinical pathways, (4) ease of use by team members, and (5) adherence reporting.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence holds great promise in transforming how drugs are designed and patients are treated. In a study recently published in Science Translational Medicine, a unique artificial intelligence platform makes efficient use of small experimental datasets to design new drug combinations as well as identify the best drug combinations for specific patient samples. This quadratic phenotypic optimization platform (QPOP) does not rely on previous assumptions of molecular mechanisms of disease, but rather uses system-specific experimental data to determine the best drug combinations for a specific disease model or a patient sample. In this commentary, we explore how QPOP was applied toward multiple myeloma in the study. We also discuss how this study demonstrates the potential for applications of QPOP toward improving therapeutic regimen design and personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "How effective groups are in making decisions is a long-standing question in studying human and animal behaviour. Despite the limited social and cognitive abilities of younger people, skills which are often required for collective intelligence, studies of group performance have been limited to adults. Using a simple task of estimating the number of sweets in jars, we show in two experiments that adolescents at least as young as 11 years old improve their estimation accuracy after a period of group discussion, demonstrating collective intelligence. Although this effect was robust to the overall distribution of initial estimates, when the task generated positively skewed estimates, the geometric mean of initial estimates gave the best fit to the data compared to other tested aggregation rules. A geometric mean heuristic in consensus decision making is also likely to apply to adults, as it provides a robust and well-performing rule for aggregating different opinions. The geometric mean rule is likely to be based on an intuitive logarithmic-like number representation, and our study suggests that this mental number scaling may be beneficial in collective decisions.",

    "abstract": "We have already reported that medical students who have prior knowledge of classical Greek and Latin perform better in anatomy examinations. It has also been shown that fluency in more than one language can influence spatial and verbal intelligence and here we hypothesize that medical students who have linguistic skills develop higher spatial and verbal intelligence compared with monolingual students, that there are gender differences, and that there are positive effects on performance in anatomy examinations. One hundred and seventy-three second year medical students at Cardiff University responded to spatial and verbal intelligence questions that were adapted from the British MENSA website. This is a 63% response rate for the student cohort. The students were then categorized into different groups depending upon their linguistic knowledge and skills. Across all groups, no gender differences were discerned for either spatial or verbal intelligence. Students who were categorized as monolingual (with only skills in English) had lower spatial and verbal intelligence than those who were multilingual. Medical students who had fluency in English and non-European languages showed greater spatial and verbal intelligence than other groups. However, there was no significant improvement in their examination marks for anatomy, although the examination performance might be complicated by cultural considerations. A further finding from our study was that, where an anatomy test required spatial recognition using cadaveric specimens, students with low spatial intelligence had significantly poorer performances. Furthermore, where tests used multiple choice questions, the level of spatial and verbal intelligences had no influence. We would advocate that, when all newly-recruited medical students are tutored in medical terminologies to help them develop the extensive vocabulary required for their professional careers, they should also be made aware of any deficiencies in spatial and verbal skills that could affect their learning abilities. Given that we would expect students to benefit in their careers from developing spatial and verbal skills, we also recommend that examination tests in anatomy should avoid the exclusive use of multiple choice questions.

Participants were mainly nursing students at Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Data gathering was done using The Jefferson Scale of Empathy and The\u00a0Schutte\u00a0Self Report Emotional Intelligence Test. Data were analyzed using SPSS.\nThe results showed a strong positive correlation between empathy and emotional intelligence (r=0.499, p <.001). Students in their fourth year had the highest score for empathy (M=109.16, SD=10.16), while first-year students had the highest scores for emotional intelligence (M= 151.68, SD= 17.47). Female students got higher empathy scores than male students (t\nThe results of this study show a correlation between emotional intelligence and empathy among nursing students. Nurses with higher emotional intelligence tend to be better in establishing productive relationships with patients and their families, and if nurses possess empathetic skills, they manage their emotions more effectively. In addition to imparting knowledge and clinical experience, nursing curricula should provide students with opportunities to develop their communication and emotional skills.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to a chemical is a critical consideration in the assessment of risk, as it adds real-world context to toxicological information. Descriptions of where and how individuals spend their time are important for characterizing exposures to chemicals in consumer products and in indoor environments. Herein we create an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates longitudinal patterns in human behavior. By basing the ABM upon an artificial intelligence (AI) system, we create agents that mimic human decisions on performing behaviors relevant for determining exposures to chemicals and other stressors. We implement the ABM in a computer program called the Agent-Based Model of Human Activity Patterns (ABMHAP) that predicts the longitudinal patterns for sleeping, eating, commuting, and working. We then show that ABMHAP is capable of simulating behavior over extended periods of time. We propose that this framework, and models based on it, can generate longitudinal human behavior data for use in exposure assessments.",

    "abstract": "The success of deep networks and recent industry involvement in brain-inspired computing is igniting a widespread interest in neuromorphic hardware that emulates the biological processes of the brain on an electronic substrate. This review explores interdisciplinary approaches anchored in machine learning theory that enable the applicability of neuromorphic technologies to real-world, human-centric tasks. We find that (1) recent work in binary deep networks and approximate gradient descent learning are strikingly compatible with a neuromorphic substrate; (2) where real-time adaptability and autonomy are necessary, neuromorphic technologies can achieve significant advantages over main-stream ones; and (3) challenges in memory technologies, compounded by a tradition of bottom-up approaches in the field, block the road to major breakthroughs. We suggest that a neuromorphic learning framework, tuned specifically for the spatial and temporal constraints of the neuromorphic substrate, will help guiding hardware algorithm co-design and deploying neuromorphic hardware for proactive learning of real-world data.",

    "abstract": "The term emotional intelligence was introduced by Salovey & Mayer. It is the individual's ability to perceive, evaluate and express emotions. It is also a set of abilities which enable an individual to function effectively and they are an important factor affecting the quality of life. The literature also has a synonymous concept of emotional competence which is a collection of already acquired skills used in specific social situations. Major depressive disorder represents an affective disorder having an impact on a human being's ability to regulate emotions. In their course, there are difficulties with adequate recognition of one's emotional states as well as emotional states of other people. Research indicates, among others, the relationship between emotional intelligence and the occurrence of suicidal thoughts and tendencies, prognosis of therapeutic interactions in patients. A high level of emotional intelligence is a protective factor in the occurrence of mental disorders, including depression, affects the treatment process and influences the creation of effective strategies for coping with stress. The paper presents reports on the level of emotional intelligence and its impact on the functioning of patients with major depressive disorders.",

    "abstract": "Report change in Emotional Intelligence Appraisal scores among three cohorts of student pharmacists before and after completing the Leadership Degree Option (LDO) Program within the University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy.\nThe first three cohorts of student pharmacists who elected to enroll in the College's LDO completed the self-administered Emotional Intelligence Appraisal, Me Edition, at the start of the LDO program and again three years later at the end of the program. Paired samples t-test compared differences between mean pre- and post-scores stratified by gender.\nA total of 36 students from Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 completed and voluntarily reported their scores of the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal. There was a statistically significant increase in mean overall Emotional Intelligence Appraisal score between the start and end of the LDO (pre\u202f=\u202f76.39, post\u202f=\u202f81.03, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). Statistical significance remained when stratified by gender. There also were statistically significant differences on various sub-domain scores.\nWe observed a before and after increase in Emotional Intelligence Appraisal scores among three cohorts of pharmacy students who completed a three-year LDO Program in parallel with completing the Doctor of Pharmacy Degree Program. Emotional recognizance and management in oneself and others has potential to build leadership capacity that can be applied in the health-care delivery setting.",

    "abstract": "It is of fundamental importance to model the relationship between geo-environmental factors and piping erosion because of the environmental degradation attributed to soil loss. Methods that identify areas prone to piping erosion at the regional scale are limited. The main objective of this research is to develop a novel modeling approach by using three machine learning algorithms-mixture discriminant analysis (MDA), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA), and support vector machine (SVM) in addition to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images to map susceptibility to piping erosion in the loess-covered hilly region of Golestan Province, Northeast Iran. In this research, we have used 22 geo-environmental indices/factors and 345 identified pipes as predictors and dependent variables. The piping susceptibility maps were assessed by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Validation of the results showed that the AUC for the three mentioned algorithms varied from 90.32% to 92.45%. We concluded that the proposed approach could efficiently produce a piping susceptibility map.",

    "abstract": "Emotional difficulties have been observed in individuals with eating disorders across awide range of studies, including poor interoceptive awareness, confusion of emotional states and difficulties with emotional language. Literature has linked these difficulties with emotional functioning as being an important factor related to the core aetiology ofeating disorders, however limited knowledge exists to how this impacts on professionalability to engage patients within treatment as a result of such dysfunction. Using aqualitative design this paper explores how facets of Emotional intelligence (EI) are related to the experience of an eating disorder. The study sampled a total of 32 participants with either a professional background working with eating disorders (n=27)or participants with personal lived experience (n=5), with a number of the participants (n=13) identified as having dual roles. The findings of the study show that aspects of EIsuch as emotional regulation and lack of an emotional language are considered to beat the core of the onset and maintenance of these disorders. Additional aspects of emotional awareness and expression were found to be related to treatment disengagement and difficulties. Building on previous literature, this paper found suchemotional deficits as a transdiagnostic issue rather than specifically anorexia nervosa. Furthermore, such dysfunction was seen by professionals to have a considerable impact on therapeutic relationships and successful treatment. These findings provide insight into the potential applications that EI may have in addressing aspects of theeating disorder to create better outcomes for treatment and intervention models.",

    "abstract": "We used contemporary psychometric theory of intelligence and confirmatory factor analysis to reanalyze data obtained on samples of nonhuman primates administered the Primate Cognition Test Battery. Our main goals were to interpret stability of the Primate Cognition Test Battery tasks and factors over time and to determine whether the cognitive factors that emerge from confirmatory factor analysis for apes can be interpreted from the perspective of a major theory of human intelligence, namely, the Cattell-Horn-Carroll model. We also analyzed data for 2\u00bd-year-old children on Wechsler's preschool test to afford a comparison between ape and child cognitive factors. Results indicated that multiple cognitive abilities provide the best factor solutions for both apes and children, and that the ape factors can be meaningfully interpreted from Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory.

    "abstract": "The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved considerably in the last 60 years. While there are now many AI applications that have been deployed in high-income country contexts, use in resource-poor settings remains relatively nascent. With a few notable exceptions, there are limited examples of AI being used in such settings. However, there are signs that this is changing. Several high-profile meetings have been convened in recent years to discuss the development and deployment of AI applications to reduce poverty and deliver a broad range of critical public services. We provide a general overview of AI and how it can be used to improve health outcomes in resource-poor settings. We also describe some of the current ethical debates around patient safety and privacy. Despite current challenges, AI holds tremendous promise for transforming the provision of healthcare services in resource-poor settings. Many health system hurdles in such settings could be overcome with the use of AI and other complementary emerging technologies. Further research and investments in the development of AI tools tailored to resource-poor settings will accelerate realising of the full potential of AI for improving global health.",

    "abstract": "A paradigm shift in human evolution, from our predecessors, the 'hunter-gatherers' to the 'era of digital revolution', has made certain human skills more and more machine driven. This digital revolution has made possible a constant connectivity, wearable technologies, customized platforms, enormous data storage and cloud computing at high speeds, smart phones and apps, internet of things, artificial intelligence, telemedicine, etc. These have made real-time monitoring and interventions possible in healthcare. Most advanced countries have made electronic health records (EHR) mandatory. The Government of India has an agenda of Digital India and digital healthcare and might insist on EHRs. EHR is a real-time, patient-centered digital version of a patient's paper record/chart, available instantly and securely to authorized users. EHR contains a patient's medical history, diagnosis, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiological images, and laboratory results. It can access evidence-based tools that help to make safer decisions about a patient's care with enhanced decision support, clinical alerts, reminders and medical information. The procedure is also more reliable for dispensing medications and introduces the convenience of e-prescriptions. While the advanced technology and digital devices are well received by the healthcare providers, universal acceptance of the EHRs is far from achieving its full potential. The author, in this paper, discusses the current scenario and issues concerned with EHRs in the digital healthcare.",

    "abstract": "The confusion of MRI sequence names could be solved if MR images were automatically identified after image data acquisition. We revealed the ability of deep learning to classify head MRI sequences.\nSeventy-eight patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) having apparently normal head MR images and 78 intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) patients with morphologically deformed head MR images were enrolled. Six imaging protocols were selected to be performed: T2-weighted imaging, fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging, T2-star-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient mapping, and source images of time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography. The proximal first image slices and middle image slices having ambiguous and distinctive contrast patterns, respectively, were classified by two deep learning imaging classifiers, AlexNet and GoogLeNet.\nAlexNet had accuracies of 73.3%, 73.6%, 73.1%, and 60.7% in the middle slices of MCI group, middle slices of ICH group, first slices of MCI group, and first slices of ICH group, while GoogLeNet had accuracies of 100%, 98.1%, 93.1%, and 94.8%, respectively. AlexNet significantly had lower classification ability than GoogLeNet for all datasets.\nGoogLeNet could judge the types of head MRI sequences with a small amount of training data, irrespective of morphological or contrast conditions.",

    "abstract": "Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is a novel activity metric that translates heart rate variations during exercise into a weekly score. Weekly PAI scores assessed at a single point in time were found to associate with lower risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the general healthy population. However, to date, the associations between long-term longitudinal changes in weekly PAI scores and mortality have not been explored.\nThe aim of the present study was to prospectively examine the association between change in weekly PAI scores estimated 10\u202fyears apart, and risk of mortality from CVD and all-causes.\nWe performed a prospective cohort study of 11,870 men and 13,010 women without known CVD in Norway. By using data from the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT), PAI was estimated twice, ten years apart (HUNT1 1984-86 and HUNT2 1995-97). Mortality was followed-up until December 31, 2015. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for death from CVD and all-causes related to temporal changes in PAI were estimated using Cox regression analyses.\nDuring a mean (SD) of 18 (4) years of follow-up, there were 4782 deaths, including 1560 deaths caused by CVD. Multi-adjusted analyses demonstrated that participants achieving a score of \u2265100 PAI at both time points had 32% lower risk of CVD mortality (AHR 0.68; CI: 0.54-0.86) for CVD mortality and 20% lower risk of all-cause mortality (AHR 0.80; CI: 71-0.91) compared with participants obtaining <100 weekly PAI at both measurements. For participants having <100 PAI in HUNT1 but \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2, the AHRs were 0.87 (CI: 0.74-1.03) for CVD mortality, and 0.86 (CI: 0.79-0.95) for all-cause mortality. We also found an inverse linear relationship between change in PAI and risk of CVD mortality among participants with 0 PAI (P\u202f<\u202f0.01), and \u226450 PAI (P\u202f=\u202f0.04) in HUNT1, indicating that an increase in PAI over time is associated with lower risk of mortality. Excluding the first three years of follow-up did not substantially alter the findings. Increasing PAI score from <100 PAI in HUNT1 to \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2 was associated with 6.6\u202fyears gained lifespan.\nAmong men and women without known CVD, an increase in PAI score and sustained high PAI score over a 10-year period was associated with lower risk of mortality.",

The digitalization era is characterized by a large production of new data streams while existing processes are progressively migrated, such as writing or imaging. The very large and fast-growing amount of data available requires new storage, transport and analytical tools. This paper presents some of them, such as natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and graph databases. A short introduction to the technology of blockchain is also provided, as it is increasingly used in some non-monetary transaction in medicine, such as data exchanges and consent management.\nLa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, la m\u00e9decine en particulier, sont emport\u00e9es par la vague de la digitalisation.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is a general term that means to accomplish a task mainly by a computer, with the least human beings participation, and it is widely accepted as the invention of robots. With the development of this new technology, artificial intelligence has been one of the most influential information technology revolutions. We searched these English-language studies relative to ophthalmology published on PubMed and Springer databases. The application of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology mainly concentrates on the diseases with a high incidence, such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related or congenital cataract and few with retinal vein occlusion. According to the above studies, we conclude that the sensitivity of detection and accuracy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy ranged from 75% to 91.7%, for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy ranged from 75% to 94.7%, for age-related macular degeneration it ranged from 75% to 100%, for retinopathy of prematurity ranged over 95%, for retinal vein occlusion just one study reported ranged over 97%, for glaucoma ranged 63.7% to 93.1%, and for cataract it achieved a more than 70% similarity against clinical grading.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between the ways we process space, numbers and time may arise from shared and innate generic magnitude representations. Alternatively or concurrently, such interactions could be due to the use of physical magnitudes, like spatial extent, as metaphors for more abstract ones, like number and duration. That numbers might be spatially represented along a mental number line is suggested by the SNARC effect: faster left-side responses to small single digits, like 1 or 2, and faster right-side responses to large ones, like 8 or 9. Previously, we found that time estimation predicts mathematical intelligence and speculated that it may predict spatial ability too. Here, addressing this issue, we test-on a relatively large sample of adults and entirely within subjects-the relationships between (a) time: proficiency at producing and evaluating durations shorter than one second, (b) space: the ability to mentally rotate objects, (c) numbers: mathematical reasoning skills, and (d) space-number associations: the SNARC effect. Better time estimation was linked to greater mathematical intelligence and better spatial skills. Strikingly, however, stronger associations between space and numbers predicted worse mathematical intelligence and poorer time estimation.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the present paper is to introduce a dynamic life cycle model that explains the reproduction of wealth and health over generations by introducing knowledge from cognitive neuroscience into the existing knowledge from the socioeconomic literature. The socioeconomic literature successfully identified the major role of socioeconomic status of parents, both as a direct and indirect effect, in the shaping and intergenerational reproduction of wealth and health. Furthermore, the importance of cognitive abilities as actor in this process has been widely studied in socioeconomic literature. A third factor that has been identified by the socioeconomic discipline is the so-called non-cognitive capabilities. This category, however, lacks a clear definition and seems to be a catchall for a collection of factors. Within the repository of these non-cognitive capabilities the construct of executive functions is an interesting and important contribution from cognitive neuroscience. The multidimensional construct of executive functioning or cognitive control (i.e. planning and formulation of objectives) and monitoring processes (i.e. influences the execution of these goals) is a valuable addition to a framework on reproduction of wealth and health over generations, because executive functions are sensitive to training. Merging insights of the socioeconomic literature and cognitive neuroscience in a life cycle model opens the opportunity of educational initiatives with regard to executive functions to break the intergenerational reproduction of poverty and deprivation.",

    "abstract": "Ophthalmology is a discipline that is highly dependent on the development of technology. Artificial intelligence is a new technological revolution, which will in all-round and fundamentally influence the progression of modern ophthalmology. Ophthalmologists should actively pay close attention to the development of artificial intelligence technology with great enthusiasm, and gradually realize the maximum utilization of artificial intelligence technology so as to facilitate the new development in ophthalmology. We should proactively seek for the opportunities of cooperating with the research organization and expert engineers in the area of artificial intelligence to promote the application of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology as soon as possible.

    "abstract": "An investigation is presented to improve on the performances of the Basic DRASTIC Framework (BDF) and its variation by the Fuzzy-Catastrophe Framework (FCF), both of which provide an estimate of intrinsic aquifer vulnerabilities to anthropogenic contamination. BDF prescribes rates and weights for 7 data layers but FCF is an unsupervised learning framework based on a multicriteria decision theory by integrating fuzzy membership function and catastrophe theory. The challenges in the paper include: (i) the study area comprises confined and unconfined aquifers and (ii) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to run Multiple Framework (AIMF) in order to map specific vulnerability due to a specific contaminant. Predicted results by AIMF are referred to as Specific Vulnerability Indices, as the learned VIs are referenced to site-specific nitrate-N. The results show that correlation coefficient between BDF or FCF with nitrate-N is lower than 0.7 but the AIMF strategy improves it to greater than 0.95. The results are evidence for the proof-of-concept for transforming frameworks to models capable of further learning.",

    "abstract": "General intelligence or g is one of the most thoroughly studied concepts in the behavioral sciences. Measures of intelligence are predictive of a wide range of educational, occupational, and life outcomes, including creative productivity and are systematically related to physical health and successful aging. The nexus of relations suggests 1 or several fundamental biological mechanisms underlie g, health, and aging, among other outcomes. Cell-damaging oxidative stress has been proposed as 1 of many potential mechanisms, but the proposal is underdeveloped and does not capture other important mitochondrial functions. I flesh out this proposal and argue that the overall efficiency of mitochondrial functioning is a core component of g; the most fundamental biological mechanism common to all brain and cognitive processes and that contributes to the relations among intelligence, health, and aging. The proposal integrates research on intelligence with models of the centrality of mitochondria to brain development and functioning, neurological diseases, and health more generally. Moreover, the combination of the maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the evolution of compensatory nuclear DNA, and the inability of evolutionary processes to purge deleterious mtDNA in males may contribute to the sex difference in variability in intelligence and in other cognitive domains. The proposal unifies many now disparate literatures and generates testable predictions for future studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved).",

    "abstract": "To describe and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven structured reporting system by direct comparison of automatically generated reports to results from actual clinical reports generated by nuclear cardiology experts.\nQuantitative parameters extracted from myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) studies are used by our AI reporting system to generate automatically a guideline-compliant structured report (sR).\nA new nonparametric approach generates distribution functions of rest and stress, perfusion, and thickening, for each of 17 left ventricle segments that are then transformed to certainty factors (CFs) that a segment is hypoperfused, ischemic. These CFs are then input to our set of heuristic rules used to reach diagnostic findings and impressions propagated into a sR referred as an AI-driven structured report (AIsR). The diagnostic accuracy of the AIsR for detecting coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemia was tested in 1,000 patients who had undergone rest/stress SPECT MPI.\nAt the high-specificity (SP) level, in a subset of 100 patients, there were no statistical differences in the agreements between the AIsr, and nine experts' impressions of CAD (P\u00a0=\u00a0.33) or ischemia (P\u00a0=\u00a0.37). This high-SP level also yielded the highest accuracy across global and regional results in the 1,000 patients. These accuracies were statistically significantly better than the other two levels [sensitivity (SN)/SP tradeoff, high SN] across all comparisons.\nThis AI reporting system automatically generates a structured natural language report with a diagnostic performance comparable to those of experts.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to study the association of urine fluoride with intelligence quotient (IQ) in children with a careful consideration of up to 30 potential confounding factors as well as possible heterogeneity of the relation between urine fluoride levels and IQ scores across children with different dopamine receptor-2 (DRD2) Taq 1A genotypes (CC, CT, and TT).\nA school-based cross-sectional study design was applied. A total of 323 children (2014-2015, 7-12 years old) were enrolled from four schools in both historical endemic and non-endemic areas of fluorosis in Tianjin of China using a cluster sampling method. Urine fluoride levels and age-specific IQ scores in children were measured at the enrollment. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods were used to genotype DRD2 Taq 1A polymorphism with genomic DNA isolated from whole blood collected at the enrollment. Multiple linear regression models were applied to evaluate the relationship between urine fluoride levels and IQ scores overall and within the DRD2 Taq 1A SNP = CC/CT and TT subgroups. Model robustness was tested through bootstrap, sensitivity analysis, and cross-validation techniques. A safety threshold of urine fluoride levels for IQ impairment was determined in the subgroup TT.\nIn overall participants, the DRD2 Taq 1A polymorphism itself was not related to IQ scores in children who had a high level of urine fluoride. In the CC/CT subgroup, urine fluoride levels and IQ scores in children were unrelated (adjusted \u03b2 (95% confidence interval (CI)) = - 1.59 (- 4.24, 1.05), p = 0.236). Among the participants carrying the TT genotype, there was a strong and robust negative linear relationship between log-urine fluoride and IQ scores in children (adjusted \u03b2 (95% CI) = - 12.31 (- 18.69, - 5.94), p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Urine fluoride levels had a stronger association with IQ in children carrying the TT genotype (adjusted \u03b2 = - 12.31, bootstrapped standard error (SE) = 1.28), compared to that in overall participants (adjusted \u03b2 = - 2.47, bootstrapped SE = 3.75) (Z = 2.483 and bootstrapped p = 0.007). The safety threshold of urine fluoride levels in the subgroup TT was 1.73\u202fmg/L (95% CI = (1.51, 1.97) (mg/L)).\nThere is heterogeneity in the relation between urine fluoride and IQ across children carrying different DRD2 Taq 1A genotypes. Large-scale epidemiological studies are needed to confirm our findings.",

    "abstract": "I was asked by the Central Intelligence Agency in the spring of 2002 about how the research on learned helplessness could help captured Americans resist and evade torture and interrogation. There was no discussion of how learned helplessness could be used with detainees nor any mention of the interrogation of detainees. James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen later created a program of \"enhanced interrogation\" of detainees and it was incorrectly reported that they based it on the theory of learned helplessness. I played no role at all in these developments, and I am grieved that scientific research created to relieve helplessness and depression might have been used for brutal interrogations. The unfounded attacks on me and others, however, may have been intended to discourage young psychologists from working with the Department of Defense, and I urge American Psychological Association not to waver in its long-standing commitment to serve the nation.",

    "abstract": "Although previous research has highlighted the association between emotional intelligence (EI) and job satisfaction, the underlying mechanisms remain relatively unexplored. To address this gap, this study examined employee engagement as a potential mediator of the association. A multi-occupational sample of 405 Spanish professionals completed the Wong Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale and an Overall Job Satisfaction Scale as well as providing socio-demographic data. As expected, employees' EI was positively related to engagement dimensions (vigour, dedication and absorption) as well as overall job satisfaction. Bootstrap estimates from multiple mediation analysis confirmed that employees' perceived EI was indirectly associated with job satisfaction via vigour and dedication scores, even when controlling for the effects of socio-demographic variables. Similarly, the same pattern was found when multiple mediation was conducted for each EI dimension. Our study contributes to understanding of the processes involved in maintaining and enhancing positive attitudes at work, providing the first, encouraging evidence that work engagement play a role in the EI-job satisfaction link. Our results extend the EI literature by elucidating the pathways through which EI is linked to positive employee attitudes and suggests that intervention programs designed to bolster EI might prove effective at increasing job satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Client aggression in forensic psychiatry is associated with burnout symptoms in nursing staff. It is unclear what mechanisms contribute to this relationship. The type and severity of aggression might be of importance in the association between client aggression and burnout symptoms, but also the personality characteristics and emotional intelligence of nursing staff. It is unknown whether wearable devices that measure arousal can be used to detect chronic stress and burnout symptoms. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Especially, physical aggression as experienced by nursing staff is associated with staff's burnout symptoms (e.g., emotional exhaustion and depersonalization). Further research on the aggression questionnaire is necessary. The stress management skill of nursing staff is an important factor to consider in the association between burnout symptoms and client aggression. The wearable device was not useful for detecting burnout symptoms. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Nursing staff who experience (physical) aggression should be carefully monitored and should receive social support from their management to aid their well-being. Contrary to intuition, nurses who reported a higher number of stress management skills might have to be monitored more closely if necessary.\nIntroduction Aggressive behaviour of forensic clients is associated with burnout symptoms in nursing staff. The role of staff characteristics as moderators is unclear. Aim We explored the association between type and severity of aggressive behaviour as experienced by nursing staff and staff's burnout symptoms. In addition, the moderating roles of personality characteristics and emotional intelligence (EI) were studied. Moreover, the usefulness of ambulatory skin conductance assessments in detecting arousal related to burnout symptoms was studied. Method A total of 114 forensic nursing staff members filled out questionnaires and wore an ambulatory device. Results Experiencing physical aggression was positively associated with staff's burnout symptoms. Stress management skills, a subscale of EI, but not personality, moderated this relationship. Skin conductance was not associated with burnout symptoms. Remarkably, the association between aggression and burnout symptoms was highest for staff reporting a higher number of stress management skills. Discussion Longitudinal research is necessary to establish causality between client aggression and staff burnout symptoms. In addition, further research is necessary on the validity of the aggression measure used in the current study. Implication for practice Nursing staff who experience physical aggression frequently should receive social support for this, and staff who report high stress management skills should be monitored more carefully after having been confronted with aggression.",

    "abstract": "Psychometric intelligence is closely related to working memory capacity. Here we aim to determine the associations of neural activation patterns during the N-back working memory paradigm with psychometric intelligence and working memory performance. We solved the statistical problems of previous studies using (1) a large cohort of 1235 young adults and (2) robust voxel-by-voxel permutation-based statistics at the whole-brain level. Many of the significant correlations were weak, and our findings were not consistent with those of previous studies. We observed that many of the significant correlations involved brain areas in the periphery or boundaries between the task-positive network (TPN) and task-negative network (TNN), suggesting that the expansion of the TPN or TNN is associated with greater cognitive ability. Lower activity in TPN and less task-induced deactivation (TID) in TNN were associated with greater cognitive ability. These findings indicate that subjects with greater cognitive ability have a lower brain response to task demand, consistent with the notion that TID in TNN reflects cognitive demand but partly inconsistent with the prevailing neural efficiency theory. One exception was the pre-supplementary motor area, which plays a key role in cognitive control and sequential processing. In this area, intelligent subjects demonstrated greater activity related to working memory, suggesting that the pre-supplementary motor area plays a unique role in the execution of working memory tasks in intelligent subjects.",

    "abstract": "To test whether Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI), a personalized metric of physical activity (PA) tracking, is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in patients with self-reported CVD and to determine whether these associations change depending on whether contemporary PA recommendations are met.\nA total of 3133 patients with CVD (mean [SD] age, 67.6 [10.3] years; 64% men) were followed from the date of participation in the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (between January 1, 1984, and February 28, 1986) until the date of death or the end of follow-up (December 31, 2015). The participants' weekly PAI score was calculated and divided into 4 groups (PAI scores of 0, \u226450, 51-99, and \u2265100). We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios for CVD and all-cause mortality rates.\nAfter mean follow-up of 12.5 years (39,157 person-years), there were 2936 deaths (94%), including 1936 CVD deaths. Participants with weekly PAI scores of 100 or greater had 36% (95% CI, 21%-48%) and 24% (95% CI, 10%-35%) lower risk of mortality from CVD and all causes, respectively, compared with the inactive group. Participants had similar risk reductions associated with their weekly PAI scores regardless of following contemporary PA recommendations or not.\nObtaining a weekly PAI score of at least 100 was associated with lower mortality risk from CVD and all causes in individuals with CVD regardless of whether the current PA recommendations were met.",

The results of confirmatory factor analysis supported the factorial validity of the Slovene CQS and the existence of a general (second-order) cultural intelligence factor. The four scales and the overall (general) CQS scale showed satisfactory internal consistency. The results of multiple-group confirmatory factor analyses supported the hypotheses of partial measurement invariance across gender, and full measurement invariance across type of settlement (urban vs. rural).",

    "abstract": "How are the myriad stimuli arriving at our senses transformed into conscious thought? To address this question, in a series of studies, we asked whether a common mechanism underlies loss of information processing in unconscious states across different conditions, which could shed light on the brain mechanisms of conscious cognition. With a novel approach, we brought together for the first time, data from the same paradigm-a highly engaging auditory-only narrative-in three independent domains: anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, unconsciousness after brain injury, and individual differences in intellectual abilities during conscious cognition. During external stimulation in the unconscious state, the functional differentiation between the auditory and fronto-parietal systems decreased significantly relatively to the conscious state. Conversely, we found that stronger functional differentiation between these systems in response to external stimulation predicted higher intellectual abilities during conscious cognition, in particular higher verbal acuity scores in independent cognitive testing battery. These convergent findings suggest that the responsivity of sensory and higher-order brain systems to external stimulation, especially through the diversification of their functional responses is an essential feature of conscious cognition and verbal intelligence.",

    "abstract": "The interest in Expert systems has increased in the medical area. Some of them are employed even for diagnosis. With the variability of transcatheter prostheses, the most appropriate choice can be complex. This scenario reveals an enabling environment for the use of an Expert system. The goal of the study was to develop an Expert system based on artificial intelligence for supporting the transcatheter aortic prosthesis selection.\nThe system was developed on Expert SINTA. The rules were created according to anatomical parameters indicated by the manufacturing company. Annular aortic diameter, aortic area, aortic perimeter, ascending aorta diameter and Valsalva sinus diameter were considered. After performing system accuracy tests, it was applied in a retrospective cohort of 22 patients with submitted to the CoreValve prosthesis implantation. Then, the system indications were compared to the real heart team decisions.\nFor 10 (45.4%) of the 22 patients there was no concordance between the Expert system and the heart team. In all cases with discordance, the software was right in the indication. Then, the patients were stratified in two groups (same indication vs. divergent indication). The baseline characteristics did not show any significant difference. Mortality, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block, aortic regurgitation and prosthesis leak did not present differences. Therefore, the maximum aortic gradient in the post-procedure period was higher in the Divergent Indication group (23.9 mmHg vs. 11.9 mmHg, P=0.03), and the mean aortic gradient showed a similar trend.\nThe utilization of the Expert system was accurate, showing good potential in the support of medical decision. Patients with divergent indication presented high post-procedure aortic gradients and, even without clinical repercussion, these parameters, when elevated, can lead to early prosthesis dysfunction and the necessity of reoperation.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence of the efficacy of active learning has prompted educators to consider adoption of these practices in college-level classrooms. One tenet of active learning is that most, if not all, students have the ability to learn. Instructors' perspectives on learning, however, may or may not be aligned with this. One belief held by some educators is that intelligence is fixed, that is, some students are more intelligent and have a higher ability to learn than others. Instructors with a fixed mindset may not be convinced that their investment in developing active-learning materials will be as fruitful as the education evidence suggests, because these instructors may not believe that most students can grow in their learning. Here, we explored the relationship between fixed mindsets and the adoption of active-learning strategies. We found that instructors with higher fixed mindsets were less persuaded that active-learning strategies were a good idea and less likely to implement the teaching practices. Our research suggests that development initiatives should explicitly address educators' lay theories of intelligence ( fixed or growth mindset) to support successful implementation of active learning.",

    "abstract": "In the future artificial intelligence (AI) will have the potential to improve outcomes diabetes care. With the creation of new sensors for physiological monitoring sensors and the introduction of smart insulin pens, novel data relationships based on personal phenotypic and genotypic information will lead to selections of tailored, effective therapies that will transform health care. However, decision-making processes based exclusively on quantitative metrics that ignore qualitative factors could create a quantitative fallacy. Difficult to quantify inputs into AI-based therapeutic decision-making processes include empathy, compassion, experience, and unconscious bias. Failure to consider these \"softer\" variables could lead to important errors. In other words, that which is not quantified about human health and behavior is still part of the calculus for determining therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is a form of artificial intelligence which is placed to transform the twenty-first century. Rapid, recent progress in its underlying architecture and algorithms and growth in the size of datasets have led to increasing computer competence across a range of fields. These include driving a vehicle, language translation, chatbots and beyond human performance at complex board games such as Go. Here, we review the fundamentals and algorithms behind machine learning and highlight specific approaches to learning and optimisation. We then summarise the applications of ML to medicine. In particular, we showcase recent diagnostic performances, and caveats, in the fields of dermatology, radiology, pathology and general microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Violent radicalization and terrorism continue to pose social and security problems. Starting from the theoretical framework offered by the significance quest theory, the purpose of this research was to analyze the different roles that radical intentions play in the relationship between the loss of significance and violent disinhibition in Muslims and non-Muslims. For this reason, we carried out two studies: the first one with 133 Muslims and 126 non-Muslims, and the second with 98 Muslims and 167 non-Muslims. Specifically, we measured how perceived oppression influenced violent disinhibition through radical intentions. Secondly, we also measured the impact of identity and cultural intelligence in these relations. The main finding of the research was that there was an indirect effect of perceived oppression on violent disinhibition through radical intentions in the Muslim sample, whereas, in the non-Muslim sample, the effect of perceived oppression on violent disinhibition was not mediated by radical intentions. These results were replicated in both studies. Additionally, we found that identity and culture were factors that moderated the proposed relations. This work therefore shows that the conjunction of the loss of significance and radical intentions seems to strongly exacerbate the likelihood of a process of violent disinhibition for those who are considered to be in marginal contexts. Overall, different pathways and intervening factors are in the process of radicalizing Muslims and non-Muslims in Western societies.",

    "abstract": "Aware that engagement in the healthcare field needs high levels of emotional intelligence, we began this study to determine relationship between engagement and emotional intelligence in nurses. The objective of this study was to determine the explanatory value of the components of emotional intelligence for engagement in a sample of nurses. The final study sample was made up of 2126 working nursing professionals. Data was obtained by distributing, an ad hoc questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic information, and to collect professional and employment information, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale and the Reduced Emotional Intelligence Inventory for Adults were used. The results showed that nurses with higher levels of emotional intelligence also scored more highly in engagement, with the interpersonal factor being the greatest predictor of engagement. This study has significant practical implications for the creation of intervention programs and activities to improve the performance of nurses in the workplace.",

    "abstract": "High emotional intelligence and leadership traits are essential for physicians in managing their responsibilities and thus building successful interactions with patients. This study explored the relationship between emotional intelligence and leadership traits among family physicians.\nParticipants (2975 men, 972 women, mean\u00a0=\u00a042.0 ages, SD\u00a0=\u00a07.47) were family physicians working at family health-care centers across the seven geographical regions of Turkey who were contacted by e-mail. The Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue) and Leadership Traits Tool were used to collect data. Data were analyzed concerning physicians' sex, age, health-care experience, and geographical region. The correlation between Trait Emotional Intelligence (TEI) and leadership was also being examined.\nOur findings suggest that family physicians' TEI differs based on sex, age, health-care experience, and the geographical region where they work. Women had higher mean values than did men for well-being, emotionality, and global TEI. Physicians aged younger than 29\u00a0years had the lowest mean values for emotional intelligence. As physicians' health-care experience increased, they received higher scores for emotional intelligence. Physicians working in the Mediterranean had the highest mean TEI scores. There was a positive correlation between family physicians' emotional intelligence and leadership traits. Higher emotional intelligence was correlated with increased leadership traits.\nEmotional intelligence and leadership traits play crucial roles in increasing physicians' personal and professional development. This may also increase physicians' caregiving competencies and thus the quality of health services, as well as potentially decreasing physicians' burnout and health-related costs.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) has been increasingly associated with the success of health care professionals, including dental professionals. Mental health, physical health, and life satisfaction all have been linked to having a high EI. The aim of this study was to determine any associations between EI scores and academic and clinical performance in a cohort of undergraduate dental hygiene students. All 63 first- and second-year dental hygiene students enrolled at The Ohio State University in the spring term 2017 were invited to participate in this quantitative cross-sectional study. The survey consisted of demographic questions and 30 emotional quotient self-assessment checklist questions divided into six EI subsets. The EI subset scores were then correlated with students' academic and clinical grades. A total of 45 students completed the questionnaire, for a response rate of 71.4%. Most of the participants scored between 16 and 19 for each EI domain, meaning they had a moderate EI level. A significant regression equation of EI subset scores and clinical GPA was found (F(3,41)=7.474, p<0.001), with an R",

    "abstract": "An important construct to consider within diabetes management and the changing landscape of diabetes therapies is self-efficacy. Self-efficacy research holds the potential to inform and assist the diabetes team as well as patients with type 1 diabetes.\nIn this descriptive-correlation study, 200 adolescents with type 1 diabetes were enrolled. To measure spiritual intelligence, the 24-question Spiritual Intelligence Self-Report Inventory questionnaire and to measure self-efficacy of diabetes, the Self-efficacy Questionnaire (8 questions) were used. Data collection was conducted by simple sampling. Data were analyzed using Pearson analysis, mean, and standard deviation analysis tests.\nNearly 66% of the participants were female, the mean age of the samples was 17.10 \u00b1 1.85 years, the mean duration of diabetes was 5.98 \u00b1 3.79 years, and 62.5% had a history of diabetes in first-degree relatives. Almost 42% of the participants were the first children of the family and 29.5% were studying at the university. The mean score of spiritual intelligence was 60.42 \u00b1 12.9. The mean self-efficacy score was 5.41 \u00b1 1.87. The mean scores in the critical thinking, personal meaning production, transcendental awareness, conscious state expansion were 18.31 \u00b1 4.33, 13.17 \u00b1 3.36, 11.26 \u00b1 3.36, 46.14 \u00b1 1.04, 11.33 \u00b1 1.04, and 11.89 \u00b1 3.9, respectively. Cronbach's alpha level on the level of spiritual intelligence and self-efficacy was 0.903 and 0.082, respectively, at 95% confidence level. There was a significant relationship between spiritual intelligence and self-efficacy (\nThis study showed that spiritual intelligence correlates with self-efficacy and has a decisive role in improving the health of adolescents with diabetes.",

    "abstract": "High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) are thought to be a promising marker for epileptogenicity. A number of automated detection algorithms have been developed for reliable analysis of invasively recorded HFOs. However, invasive recordings are not widely applicable since they bear risks and costs, and the harm of the surgical intervention of implantation needs to be weighted against the informational benefits of the invasive examination. In contrast, scalp EEG is widely available at low costs and does not bear any risks. However, the detection of HFOs on the scalp represents a challenge that was taken on so far mostly via visual detection. Visual detection of HFOs is, in turn, highly time-consuming and subjective. In this review, we discuss that automated detection algorithms for detection of HFOs on the scalp are highly warranted because the available algorithms were all developed for invasively recorded EEG and do not perform satisfactorily in scalp EEG because of the low signal-to-noise ratio and numerous artefacts as well as physiological activity that obscures the tiny phenomena in the high-frequency range.",

Although AI has broad application across many medical fields, it will have particular utility in ophthalmology and will dramatically change the diagnostic and treatment pathways for many eye conditions such as corneal ectasias, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. However, given that AI has primarily been driven as a computer science, its concepts and terminology are unfamiliar to many medical professionals. Important key terms such as machine learning and deep learning are often misunderstood and incorrectly used interchangeably. This article presents an overview of AI and new developments relevant to ophthalmology.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical predictive processing (PP) has recently emerged as a candidate theoretical paradigm for neurobehavioral research. To date, PP has found support through its success in offering compelling explanations for a number of perceptual, cognitive, and psychiatric phenomena, as well as from accumulating neurophysiological evidence. However, its implications for understanding intelligence and its neural basis have received relatively little attention. The present review outlines the key tenets and evidence for PP, and assesses its implications for intelligence research. It is argued that PP suggests indeterminacy as a unifying principle from which to investigate the cognitive hierarchy and brain-ability correlations. The resulting framework not only accommodates prominent psychometric models of intelligence, but also incorporates key findings from neuroanatomical and functional activation research, and motivates new predictions via the mechanisms of prediction-error minimization. Because PP also suggests unique neural signatures of experience-dependent activity, it may also help clarify environmental contributions to intellectual development. It is concluded that PP represents a plausible, integrative framework that could enhance progress in the neuroscience of intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Emotional Intelligence (EI) is now widely used in organizations and graduate schools with an increase in published research supporting it. Discussion about EI whether based on measures or theory has given little distinction as to behavioral EI (i.e., how does EI appear in a person's actions). This results in spurious conflicts about the validity of the different theories or measures which likely limit predicting managerial and leadership effectiveness, engagement, innovation and organizational citizenship. By adding a behavioral level, the concept of EI could relate to work and life outcomes beyond general mental ability and personality traits, avoid some of the criticisms while providing a more holistic theory of EI. As such, EI exists within personality as a performance trait or ability, ",

    "abstract": "Non-contact sensors are gaining popularity in clinical settings to monitor the vital parameters of patients. In this study, we used a non-contact sensor device to monitor vital parameters like the heart rate, respiration rate, and heart rate variability of hemodialysis (HD) patients for a period of 23 weeks during their HD sessions. During these 23 weeks, a total number of 3237 HD sessions were observed. Out of 109 patients enrolled in the study, 78 patients reported clinical events such as muscle spasms, inpatient stays, emergency visits or even death during the study period. We analyzed the sensor data of these two groups of patients, namely an event and no-event group. We found a statistically significant difference in the heart rates, respiration rates, and some heart rate variability parameters among the two groups of patients when their means were compared using an independent sample t-test. We further developed a supervised machine-learning-based prediction model to predict event or no-event based on the sensor data and demographic information. A mean area under curve (ROC AUC) of 90.16% with 96.21% mean precision, and 88.47% mean recall was achieved. Our findings point towards the novel use of non-contact sensors in clinical settings to monitor the vital parameters of patients and the further development of early warning solutions using artificial intelligence (AI) for the prediction of clinical events. These models could assist healthcare professionals in taking decisions and designing better care plans for patients by early detecting changes to vital parameters.",

    "abstract": "Obesity has become an increasingly widespread endemic with social implications; however, the relationship between higher body mass index (BMI) and psychological functioning is still not fully understood. This study examined the differences in affect-related psychological variables among BMI classes. A total of 134 adults seeking treatment for obesity and 124 controls completed a set of questionnaires to assess: trait emotional intelligence, emotion regulation strategies, anxiety, depression, binge eating behaviors and happiness. Correlations and multivariate analysis of variance were run per each study variable controlling for BMI class (normal weight, overweight, or obesity class I, II, III). Individuals with obesity class III were characterized by reduced trait emotional intelligence and happiness, and a higher tendency to use emotion suppression compared to normal weight individuals. All individuals with obesity also showed higher levels of depression and binge eating behaviors compared to both normal weight and overweight adults. Depression and emotion suppression were the most relevant discriminant factors across BMI classes, while trait emotional intelligence resulted as an important psychological factor clustering individual differences between obese and non-obese individuals. These results suggest that more attention to the affective domain of psychological functioning is needed for proper and comprehensive treatment of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral weight loss (WL) trials show that, on average, participants regain lost weight unless provided long-term, intensive-and thus costly-intervention. Optimization solutions have shown mixed success. The artificial intelligence principle of \"reinforcement learning\" (RL) offers a new and more sophisticated form of optimization in which the intensity of each individual's intervention is continuously adjusted depending on patterns of response. In this pilot, we evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a RL-based WL intervention, and whether optimization would achieve equivalent benefit at a reduced cost compared to a non-optimized intensive intervention. Participants (n\u2009=\u200952) completed a 1-month, group-based in-person behavioral WL intervention and then (in Phase II) were randomly assigned to receive 3\u00a0months of twice-weekly remote interventions that were non-optimized (NO; 10-min phone calls) or optimized (a combination of phone calls, text exchanges, and automated messages selected by an algorithm). The Individually-Optimized (IO) and Group-Optimized (GO) algorithms selected interventions based on past performance of each intervention for each participant, and for each group member that fit into a fixed amount of time (e.g., 1\u00a0h), respectively. Results indicated that the system was feasible to deploy and acceptable to participants and coaches. As hypothesized, we were able to achieve equivalent Phase II weight losses (NO\u2009=\u20094.42%, IO\u2009=\u20094.56%, GO\u2009=\u20094.39%) at roughly one-third the cost (1.73 and 1.77 coaching hours/participant for IO and GO, versus 4.38 for NO), indicating strong promise for a RL system approach to weight loss and maintenance.",

    "abstract": "To use Twitter to characterize public perspectives regarding artificial intelligence (AI) and radiology.\nTwitter was searched for all tweets containing the terms \"artificial intelligence\" and \"radiology\" from November 2016 to October 2017. Users posting the tweets, tweet content, and linked websites were categorized.\nSix hundred and five tweets were identified. These were from 407 unique users (most commonly industry-related individuals [22.6%]; radiologists only 9.3%) and linked to 216 unique websites. 42.5% of users were from the United States. The tweets mentioned machine/deep learning in 17.2%, industry in 14.0%, a medical society/conference in 13.4%, and a university in 9.8%. 6.3% mentioned a specific clinical application, most commonly oncology and lung/tuberculosis. 24.6% of tweets had a favorable stance regarding the impact of AI on radiology, 75.4% neutral, and none were unfavorable. 88.0% of linked websites leaned toward AI being positive for the field of radiology; none leaned toward AI being negative for the field. 51.9% of linked websites specifically mentioned improved efficiency for radiology with AI. 35.2% of websites described challenges for implementing AI in radiology. Of the 47.2% of websites that mentioned the issue of AI replacing radiologists, 77.5% leaned against AI replacing radiologists, 13.7% had a neutral view, and 8.8% leaned toward AI replacing radiologists.\nThese observations provide an overview of the social media discussions regarding AI in radiology.

    "abstract": "The General Aggression Model (GAM) offers an integrative explanation of the aggressive behavior based on three stages: 1) inputs: personal and situational factors; 2) routes or individual internal states: affect, cognition, and arousal; and 3) outcomes: decision processes with a (non) aggressive result. Researchers are interested in looking for protective factors within the GAM to diminish aggression. Previous studies have found two relevant variables acting independently as risk and protective factors: emotional intelligence (EI) and negative affect (NA). The aim of the present study is to analyze a moderated mediation model including these variables as an explanation of aggressive behavior and integrate it within the GAM. Four hundred and six participants were assessed on EI, NA, and aggression. The moderated mediation analysis showed a significant negative indirect effect of the perceiving EI branch on total aggression mediated through NA levels, which, in turn, was moderated by the managing EI branch. Moreover, this relationship was also observed for the physical, anger, and hostility sub-scales of aggression. Our study demonstrates the importance of having a high ability to perceive emotions as a protective factor in the first stage of the GAM. These individuals will present lower NA in the second stage of the model, resulting in a reduction in aggression. Moreover, having a high ability to perceive emotions is particularly relevant for individuals that are less able to manage emotions, given that those participants with higher scores on the managing EI branch can reduce their aggressive behavior by mitigating the effect of NA on aggression in the third stage of the GAM.",

    "abstract": "As the most common examination tool in medical practice, chest radiography has important clinical value in the diagnosis of disease. Thus, the automatic detection of chest disease based on chest radiography has become one of the hot topics in medical imaging research. Based on the clinical applications, the study conducts a comprehensive survey on computer-aided detection (CAD) systems, and especially focuses on the artificial intelligence technology applied in chest radiography. The paper presents several common chest X-ray datasets and briefly introduces general image preprocessing procedures, such as contrast enhancement and segmentation, and bone suppression techniques that are applied to chest radiography. Then, the CAD system in the detection of specific disease (pulmonary nodules, tuberculosis, and interstitial lung diseases) and multiple diseases is described, focusing on the basic principles of the algorithm, the data used in the study, the evaluation measures, and the results. Finally, the paper summarizes the CAD system in chest radiography based on artificial intelligence and discusses the existing problems and trends.",

    "abstract": "Prospective mate characteristics such as kindness, intelligence, easygoingness, and physical attraction are ranked consistently highly by both men and women. However, rank measurement does not allow for determinations of what level of a mate characteristic is rated most desirable. Based on a more informative percentile scale measurement approach, it was reported recently that mean desirability ratings of IQ in a prospective partner peaked at the 90th percentile, with a statistically significant reduction from the 90th to the 99th percentiles. The purpose of this investigation was to replicate the recently reported non-linear desirability effect associated with IQ, in addition to the evaluation of three other valued mate characteristics: easygoing, kindness, and physical attraction. Based on a sample of 214 young adults, it was found that all four mate characteristics peaked at the 90th percentile. However, the IQ and easygoing mean desirability ratings evidenced statistically significant mean reductions across the 90th to the 99th percentiles, whereas kindness and physical attraction did not. Finally, the objectively and subjectively assessed intelligence of the participants was not found to be associated with the participants' desirability ratings of IQ. We interpreted the results to be consistent with a broadly conceptualized threshold hypothesis, which states that the perceived benefits of valued mate characteristics may not extend beyond a certain point. However, mate characteristics such as intelligence and easygoing become somewhat less attractive at very elevated levels, at least based on preference ratings, for reasons that may be biological and/or psycho-social in nature.",

    "abstract": "The quality of decision and assessment of risk are key determinants of successful sport performance. Athletes differ fundamentally in their decision-making ability according to their athletic expertise level. Moreover, given the influence of emotions on decision-making, it is likely that a trait reflecting emotional functioning, trait emotional intelligence, may also influence decision-making. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the respective contribution of athletic expertise and trait emotional intelligence to non-athletic decision-making. In total, 269 participants aged between 18 and 26 years with a range of athletic experience i.e. none (n\u2009=\u200971), novice (n\u2009=\u200954), amateur (n\u2009=\u200955), elite (n\u2009=\u200945) and super-elite (n\u2009=\u200944), completed the Emotional Intelligence Scale and the Cambridge Gambling Task. Regression modelling indicated a significant positive relationship of athletic expertise and trait emotional intelligence with the quality of decision-making, and a negative relationship with deliberation time and risk-taking. Cognitive skills transfer may explain the higher decision-making scores associated with higher athletic expertise, while individuals with higher trait emotional intelligence may anticipate better the emotional consequences linked with a gambling task, which may help individuals make better decisions and take less risks.",

    "abstract": "The emerging prosperity of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, has come into the spotlight during the past few years. Cryptocurrency exchanges, which act as the gateway to this world, now play a dominant role in the circulation of Bitcoin. Thus, delving into the analysis of the transaction patterns of exchanges can shed light on the evolution and trends in the Bitcoin market, and participants can gain hints for identifying credible exchanges as well. Not only Bitcoin practitioners but also researchers in the financial domains are interested in the business intelligence behind the curtain. However, the task of multiple exchanges exploration and comparisons has been limited owing to the lack of efficient tools. Previous methods of visualizing Bitcoin data have mainly concentrated on tracking suspicious transaction logs, but it is cumbersome to analyze exchanges and their relationships with existing tools and methods. In this paper, we present BitExTract, an interactive visual analytics system, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to explore the evolutionary transaction patterns of Bitcoin exchanges from two perspectives, namely, exchange versus exchange and exchange versus client. In particular, BitExTract summarizes the evolution of the Bitcoin market by observing the transactions between exchanges over time via a massive sequence view. A node-link diagram with ego-centered views depicts the trading network of exchanges and their temporal transaction distribution. Moreover, BitExTract embeds multiple parallel bars on a timeline to examine and compare the evolution patterns of transactions between different exchanges. Three case studies with novel insights demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our system.",

The sample was 12,514 children from the UK's Millennium Cohort Study, followed at ages 3, 5, 7, and 11\u00a0years. Decision-making (risk-taking, quality of decision-making, risk adjustment, deliberation time, and delay aversion) was measured with the Cambridge Gambling Task. Even after adjustment for confounding, intelligence was positively associated with risk adjustment and quality of decision-making in both boys and girls. Furthermore, in girls risk adjustment was related positively to IQ gains. Our findings suggest that there are important, substantively, associations between intelligence and adapting behaviour to risk at the cusp of adolescence, the period when the response to risk can shape life trajectories. Statement of Contribution What is already known on this subject In children, intelligence and decision-making, measured with gambling tasks, are inconsistently linked. This could be due to gambling tasks not separating risk-taking from contingency-learning. What the present study adds This study measured 11-year-olds' decision-making using a gambling task in which probabilities of different outcomes are presented explicitly. IQ was positively associated with risk adjustment and quality of decision-making. Also significant were IQ gains (for risk adjustment, only in girls). There are links between intelligence and adapting behaviour to statistical risk in children.",

    "abstract": "Question answering (QA) system is becoming the focus of the research in medical health in terms of providing fleetly accurate answers to users. Numerous traditional QA systems are faced to simple factual questions and do not obtain accurate answers for complex questions. In order to realize the intelligent QA system for disease diagnosis and treatment in medical informationization, in this paper, we propose a depth evidence score fusion algorithm for Chinese Medical Intelligent Question Answering System, which can measure the text information in many algorithmic ways and ensure that the QA system outputs accurately the optimal candidate answer. At the semantic level, a new text semantic evidence score based on Word2vec is proposed, which can calculate the semantic similarity between texts. Experimental results on the medical text corpus show that the depth evidence score fusion algorithm has better performance in the evidence-scoring module of the intelligent QA system.",

    "abstract": "The prognosis of esophageal cancer is relatively poor. Patients are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage when it is often too late for effective treatment. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) using deep learning has made remarkable progress in medicine. However, there are no reports on its application for diagnosing esophageal cancer. Here, we demonstrate the diagnostic ability of AI to detect esophageal cancer including squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.\nWe retrospectively collected 8428 training images of esophageal cancer from 384 patients at the Cancer Institute Hospital, Japan. Using these, we developed deep learning through convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We also prepared 1118 test images for 47 patients with 49 esophageal cancers and 50 patients without esophageal cancer to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy.\nThe CNN took 27 seconds to analyze 1118 test images and correctly detected esophageal cancer cases with a sensitivity of 98%. CNN could detect all 7 small cancer lesions less than 10\u00a0mm in size. Although the positive predictive value for each image was 40%, misdiagnosing shadows and normal structures led to a negative predictive value of 95%. The CNN could distinguish superficial esophageal cancer from advanced cancer with an accuracy of 98%.\nThe constructed CNN system for detecting esophageal cancer can analyze stored endoscopic images in a short time with high sensitivity. However, more training would lead to higher diagnostic accuracy. This system can facilitate early detection in practice, leading to a better prognosis in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide interest in artificial intelligence (AI) applications is growing rapidly. In medicine, devices based on machine/deep learning have proliferated, especially for image analysis, presaging new significant challenges for the utility of AI in healthcare. This inevitably raises numerous legal and ethical questions. In this paper we analyse the state of AI regulation in the context of medical device development, and strategies to make AI applications safe and useful in the future. We analyse the legal framework regulating medical devices and data protection in Europe and in the United States, assessing developments that are currently taking place. The European Union (EU) is reforming these fields with new legislation (General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR], Cybersecurity Directive, Medical Devices Regulation, In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation). This reform is gradual, but it has now made its first impact, with the GDPR and the Cybersecurity Directive having taken effect in May, 2018. As regards the United States (U.S.), the regulatory scene is predominantly controlled by the Food and Drug Administration. This paper considers issues of accountability, both legal and ethical. The processes of medical device decision-making are largely unpredictable, therefore holding the creators accountable for it clearly raises concerns. There is a lot that can be done in order to regulate AI applications. If this is done properly and timely, the potentiality of AI based technology, in radiology as well as in other fields, will be invaluable. TEACHING POINTS: \u2022 AI applications are medical devices supporting detection/diagnosis, work-flow, cost-effectiveness. \u2022 Regulations for safety, privacy protection, and ethical use of sensitive information are needed. \u2022 EU and U.S. have different approaches for approving and regulating new medical devices. \u2022 EU laws consider cyberattacks, incidents (notification and minimisation), and service continuity. \u2022 U.S. laws ask for opt-in data processing and use as well as for clear consumer consent.",

    "abstract": "Intelligence, as measured by standardised tests of cognitive function, such as IQ-type tests, is predictive of psychiatric diagnosis and psychological wellbeing. Using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, a measure of the shared genetic effect across traits, can be quantified; because this can be done across samples, the confounding effects of psychiatric diagnosis do not influence the magnitude of these relationships. It is now known that there are genetic effects that act across intelligence and psychiatric diagnoses, which provide a partial explanation for the phenotypic link between intelligence and mental health. Potential causal effects between intelligence and mental health have been identified, and the regions of the genome responsible for some of these cross trait associations have begun to be characterised.",

    "abstract": "Novel developments in bioinformation, bioinformatics and biostatistics, including artificial intelligence (AI), play a timely and critical role in translational care. Case in point, the extent to which viral immune surveillance is regulated by immune cells and soluble factors, and by non-immune factors informs the administration of health care. The events by which health is regained following viral infection is an allostatic process, which can be modeled using Hilbert's and Volterra's mathematical biology criteria, and biostatistical methodologies such as linear multiple regression. Health regained following viral infection can be given as Y being the sum-total of the positive factors and events (\u220f) that inherently push allostasis forward (i.e., the orderly process of immune activation and maturation) and the negative (N) factors and events that, allostatically speaking, interfere with regaining health. Any gaps in knowledge are filled by AI-aided immune tweening. Proof of concept can be tested with the fast-gaining infection using tick-borne Bunyavirus that cause severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS).",

The primary end point was whether CAD with the stained mode produced a negative predictive value (NPV) of 90% or greater for identifying diminutive rectosigmoid adenomas, the threshold required to \"diagnose-and-leave\" nonneoplastic polyps. Best- and worst-case scenarios assumed that polyps lacking either CAD diagnosis or pathology were true- or false-positive or true- or false-negative, respectively.\nOverall, 466 diminutive (including 250 rectosigmoid) polyps from 325 patients were assessed by CAD, with a pathologic prediction rate of 98.1% (457 of 466). The NPVs of CAD for diminutive rectosigmoid adenomas were 96.4% (95% CI, 91.8% to 98.8%) (best-case scenario) and 93.7% (CI, 88.3% to 97.1%) (worst-case scenario) with stained mode and 96.5% (CI, 92.1% to 98.9%) (best-case scenario) and 95.2% (CI, 90.3% to 98.0%) (worst-case scenario) with NBI.\nTwo thirds of the colonoscopies were conducted by experts who had each experienced more than 200 endocytoscopies; 186 polyps not assessed by CAD were excluded.\nReal-time CAD can achieve the performance level required for a diagnose-and-leave strategy for diminutive, nonneoplastic rectosigmoid polyps.\nJapan Society for the Promotion of Science.",

    "abstract": "Biosensor-based devices are pioneering in the modern biomedical applications and will be the future of cardiac health care. The coupling of artificial intelligence (AI) for cardiac monitoring-based biosensors for the point of care (POC) diagnostics is prominently reviewed here. This review deciphers the most significant machine-learning algorithms for the futuristic biosensors along with the internet of things, computational techniques and microchip-based essential cardiac biomarkers for real-time health monitoring and improving patient compliance. The present review also discusses the recently developed cardiac biosensors along with technical strategies involved in their mechanism of working and their applications in healthcare. Additionally, it provides a key for the ontogeny of an effective and supportive hierarchical protocol for clinical decision-making about personalized medicine through combinatory information analysis, and integrated multidisciplinary AI approaches.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing hypotheses for the evolution of cognition focus on either the demands associated with group living (the social intelligence hypothesis (SIH)) or ecological challenges such as finding food. Comparative studies testing these hypotheses have generated highly conflicting results; consequently, our understanding of the drivers of cognitive evolution remains limited. To understand how selection shapes cognition, research must incorporate an intraspecific approach, focusing on the causes and consequences of individual variation in cognition. Here, we review the findings of recent intraspecific cognitive research to investigate the predictions of the SIH. Extensive evidence from our own research on Australian magpies (",

    "abstract": "Individual people differ in their ability to reason, solve problems, think abstractly, plan and learn. A reliable measure of this general ability, also known as intelligence, can be derived from scores across a diverse set of cognitive tasks. There is great interest in understanding the neural underpinnings of individual differences in intelligence, because it is the single best predictor of long-term life success. The most replicated neural correlate of human intelligence to date is total brain volume; however, this coarse morphometric correlate says little about function. Here, we ask whether measurements of the activity of the resting brain (resting-state fMRI) might also carry information about intelligence. We used the final release of the Young Adult Human Connectome Project (",

    "abstract": "People influence each other when they interact to solve problems. Such social influence introduces both benefits (higher average solution quality due to exploitation of existing answers through social learning) and costs (lower maximum solution quality due to a reduction in individual exploration for novel answers) relative to independent problem solving. In contrast to prior work, which has focused on how the presence and network structure of social influence affect performance, here we investigate the effects of time. We show that when social influence is intermittent it provides the benefits of constant social influence without the costs. Human subjects solved the canonical traveling salesperson problem in groups of three, randomized into treatments with constant social influence, intermittent social influence, or no social influence. Groups in the intermittent social-influence treatment found the optimum solution frequently (like groups without influence) but had a high mean performance (like groups with constant influence); they learned from each other, while maintaining a high level of exploration. Solutions improved most on rounds with social influence after a period of separation. We also show that storing subjects' best solutions so that they could be reloaded and possibly modified in subsequent rounds-a ubiquitous feature of personal productivity software-is similar to constant social influence: It increases mean performance but decreases exploration.",

    "abstract": "Recent research (Erdodi et al., 2017) indicated that certain Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) Processing Speed Index (PSI)-based indices may have some utility as embedded validity indicators (EVIs) among a diagnostically diverse sample of neuropsychology referrals. Individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) are often evaluated in forensic contexts in which there is incentive to exaggerate deficits. Because individuals with SSD often have limitations in processing speed associated with their disorders, the current study sought to evaluate the false-positive (FP) rates of cutoffs identified by Erdodi et al. on WAIS-IV PSI-based EVIs among forensically committed psychiatric inpatients with SSD who had no known incentive to feign because of the nature of their legal commitments. In the current sample, the previously suggested cutoff scores on PSI-based EVIs resulted in FP rates ranging from 2% to 57% among schizophrenia spectrum patients, with unacceptable FP rates for most indices. In the current sample of SSD patients, WAIS-IV PSI-based EVIs that are calculated based on the relative performance between PSI subtests (as opposed to absolute performance on individual indices) demonstrated acceptable FP rates.

    "abstract": "To improve the detection of corneal ectasia susceptibility using tomographic data.\nMulticenter case-control study.\nData from patients from 5 different clinics from South America, the United States, and Europe were evaluated. Artificial intelligence (AI) models were generated using Pentacam HR (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany) parameters to discriminate the preoperative data of 3 groups: stable laser-assisted in\u00a0situ keratomileusis (LASIK) cases (2980 patients with minimum follow-up of 7 years), ectasia susceptibility (71 eyes of 45 patients that developed post-LASIK ectasia [PLE]), and clinical keratoconus (KC; 182 patients). Model accuracy was independently tested in a different set of stable LASIK cases (298 patients with minimum follow-up of 4 years) and in 188 unoperated patients with very asymmetric ectasia (VAE); these patients presented normal topography (VAE-NT) in 1 eye and clinically diagnosed ectasia in the other (VAE-E). Accuracy was evaluated with ROC curves.\nThe random forest (RF) provided highest accuracy among AI models in this sample with 100% sensitivity for clinical ectasia (KC+VAE-E; cutoff 0.52), being named Pentacam Random Forest Index (PRFI). Considering all cases, the PRFI had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.992 (94.2% sensitivity, 98.8% specificity; cutoff 0.216), being statistically higher than the Belin/Ambr\u00f3sio deviation (BAD-D; AUC\u00a0= 0.960, 87.3% sensitivity, 97.5% specificity; P\u00a0= .006, DeLong's test). The optimized cutoff of 0.125 provided sensitivity of 85.2% for VAE-NT and 80% for PLE, with 96.6% specificity.\nThe PRFI enhances ectasia diagnosis. Further integrations with corneal biomechanical parameters and with the corneal impact from laser vision correction are needed for assessing ectasia risk.",

    "abstract": "This observational study aimed to use artificial intelligence to describe the impact of orthognathic treatment on facial attractiveness and age appearance. Pre- and post-treatment photographs (n=2164) of 146 consecutive orthognathic patients were collected for this longitudinal retrospective single-centre study. Every image was annotated with patient-related data (age; sex; malocclusion; performed surgery). For every image, facial attractiveness (score: 0-100) and apparent age were established with dedicated convolutional neural networks trained on >0.5million images for age estimation and with >17million ratings for attractiveness. Results for pre- and post-treatment photographs were averaged for every patient separately, and apparent age compared to real age (appearance). Changes in appearance and facial attractiveness were statistically examined. Analyses were performed on the entire sample and subgroups (sex; malocclusion; performed surgery). According to the algorithms, most patients' appearance improved with treatment (66.4%), resulting in younger appearance of nearly 1year [mean change: -0.93years (95% confidence interval (CI): -1.50; -0.36); p=0.002), especially after profile-altering surgery. Orthognathic treatment had similarly a beneficial effect on attractiveness in 74.7% [mean difference: 1.22 (95% CI: 0.81; 1.63); p<0.001], especially after lower jaw surgery. This investigation illustrates that artificial intelligence might be considered to score facial attractiveness and apparent age in orthognathic patients.",

    "abstract": "In an observational longitudinal study of a sub-sample of the Aberdeen 1936 birth cohort, from age 62 to 77 years, we investigated childhood intelligence, social class, education, life-course social mobility, memory test performance and memory decline in late life. We examined 388 local residents who had attended school in Aberdeen in 1947 and measured Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) at recruitment age about 64 years and up to five times until age about 77 years. Better performance at age about 64 on AVLT was predicted by early socioeconomic status (SES), social mobility and childhood intelligence. The trajectory of AVLT decline was steeper in those who had received less education. This relationship was independent of childhood ability, sex, SES in childhood and social mobility. The protection of memory by education suggests that education supports resilience to age-related cognitive impairment. Upward social mobility does not enhance this effect, suggesting that resilience to age-related decline may be established in early life.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the long-term administration of diazoxide in patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, a post-marketing surveillance study was conducted. Between 2008 and 2015, with a maximum observation period of 7\u00a0yr, 384 patients were monitored; 117 (30.5%) experienced at least one adverse drug reaction (ADR). The most commonly observed ADR was hypertrichosis (8.6%). The incidence of water retention-related ADRs and cardiac failure-related ADRs was 8.3% and 3.4%, respectively, and many of these occurred within the first 2 mo of treatment. The mean fasting blood glucose level was 44.9 mg/dL at baseline and was maintained at > 70 mg/dL, the control target, for 4\u00a0yr. A total of 113 infants < 1 yr of age were evaluated for the prognosis for intelligence, and a majority (77.9%) were assessed as \"normal\" at the final evaluation. Most ADRs occurred at an early stage of treatment and blood glucose levels were well controlled during long-term administration. The proportion of \"normal\" patients tended to be higher in those who started treatment at a younger age. However, because of the exploratory nature of this analysis, potential effects of coexisting or underlying diseases and the age of onset or diagnosis should not be ignored.",

    "abstract": "Using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to replace human decision-making will inevitably create new risks whose consequences are unforeseeable. This naturally leads to calls for regulation, but I argue that it is too early to attempt a general system of AI regulation. Instead, we should work incrementally within the existing legal and regulatory schemes which allocate responsibility, and therefore liability, to persons. Where AI clearly creates risks which current law and regulation cannot deal with adequately, then new regulation will be needed. But in most cases, the current system can work effectively if the producers of AI technology can provide sufficient transparency in explaining how AI decisions are made. Transparency ",

    "abstract": "Public sector organizations are increasingly interested in using data science and artificial intelligence capabilities to deliver policy and generate efficiencies in high-uncertainty environments. The long-term success of data science and artificial intelligence (AI) in the public sector relies on effectively embedding it into delivery solutions for policy implementation. However, governments cannot do this integration of AI into public service delivery on their own. The UK Government Industrial Strategy is clear that delivering on the AI grand challenge requires collaboration between universities and the public and private sectors. This cross-sectoral collaborative approach is the norm in applied AI centres of excellence around the world. Despite their popularity, cross-sector collaborations entail serious management challenges that hinder their success. In this article we discuss the opportunities for and challenges of AI for the public sector. Finally, we propose a series of strategies to successfully manage these cross-sectoral collaborations.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The growing ubiquity of algorithms in society: implications, impacts and innovations'.",

This resulted in a training set of 2376 normal and 2376 abnormal images. This was used to retrain the top layer of the Inception v3 network. The resulting neural network functioned as a classifier for new \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I SPECT scans as either normal or abnormal. A completely separate set of 45 \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I SPECT scans were used for final testing of the network.\nThe area under the receiver-operator curve in final testing was 0.87. This corresponded to a test sensitivity of 96.3%, a specificity of 66.7%, a positive predictive value of 81.3% and a negative predictive value of 92.3%, using an optimum diagnostic threshold.\nThis study has provided proof of concept for the use of transfer learning, from convolutional neural networks pretrained on nonmedical images, for the interpretation of \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I SPECT scans. This has been shown to be possible in this study even with a very small sample size. This technique is likely to be applicable to many areas of diagnostic imaging.",

    "abstract": "Major advances in diagnostic technologies are offering unprecedented insight into the condition of the retina and beyond ocular disease. Digital images providing millions of morphological datasets can fast and non-invasively be analyzed in a comprehensive manner using artificial intelligence (AI). Methods based on machine learning (ML) and particularly deep learning (DL) are able to identify, localize and quantify pathological features in almost every macular and retinal disease. Convolutional neural networks thereby mimic the path of the human brain for object recognition through learning of pathological features from training sets, supervised ML, or even extrapolation from patterns recognized independently, unsupervised ML. The methods of AI-based retinal analyses are diverse and differ widely in their applicability, interpretability and reliability in different datasets and diseases. Fully automated AI-based systems have recently been approved for screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The overall potential of ML/DL includes screening, diagnostic grading as well as guidance of therapy with automated detection of disease activity, recurrences, quantification of therapeutic effects and identification of relevant targets for novel therapeutic approaches. Prediction and prognostic conclusions further expand the potential benefit of AI in retina which will enable personalized health care as well as large scale management and will empower the ophthalmologist to provide high quality diagnosis/therapy and successfully deal with the complexity of 21st century ophthalmology.",

    "abstract": "The differential diagnosis of atypical dementia remains difficult. The use of positron emission tomography (PET) still represents the gold standard for imaging diagnostics. According to the current evidence, however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is almost equal to fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, but only when using new big data and machine learning methods. In cases of atypical dementia, especially in younger patients and for follow-up, MRI is preferable to computed tomography (CT). In the clinical routine, promising MRI procedures are e.\u202fg. the automated volumetry of anatomical 3D images, as well as a\u00a0non-contrast-enhanced MRI perfusion method, called arterial spin labeling (ASL). Because of the rapidly growing amount of biomarker data, there is a\u00a0need for computer-aided big data analyses and artificial intelligence. Based on fast analyses of the diverse and rapidly increasing amount of clinical, imaging, epidemiological, molecular genetic and economic data, new knowledge on the pathogenesis, prevention and treatment can be generated. Technical availability, homogenization of the underlying data and the availability of large reference data are the basis for the widespread establishment of promising analytical methods.",

    "abstract": "Since 2013, the French Animal Health Epidemic Intelligence System (in French: Veille Sanitaire Internationale, VSI) has been monitoring signals of the emergence of new and exotic animal infectious diseases worldwide. Once detected, the VSI team verifies the signals and issues early warning reports to French animal health authorities when potential threats to France are detected. To improve detection of signals from online news sources, we designed the Platform for Automated extraction of Disease Information from the web (PADI-web). PADI-web automatically collects, processes and extracts English-language epidemiological information from Google News. The core component of PADI-web is a combined information extraction (IE) method founded on rule-based systems and data mining techniques. The IE approach allows extraction of key information on diseases, locations, dates, hosts and the number of cases mentioned in the news. We evaluated the combined method for IE on a dataset of 352 disease-related news reports mentioning the diseases involved, locations, dates, hosts and the number of cases. The combined method for IE accurately identified (F-score) 95% of the diseases and hosts, respectively, 85% of the number of cases, 83% of dates and 80% of locations from the disease-related news. We assessed the sensitivity of PADI-web to detect primary outbreaks of four emerging animal infectious diseases notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). From January to June 2016, PADI-web detected signals for 64% of all primary outbreaks of African swine fever, 53% of avian influenza, 25% of bluetongue and 19% of foot-and-mouth disease. PADI-web timely detected primary outbreaks of avian influenza and foot-and-mouth disease in Asia, i.e. they were detected 8 and 3 days before immediate notification to OIE, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The associations between higher intelligence test scores from early life and later good health, fewer illnesses, and longer life are recent discoveries. Researchers are mapping the extent of these associations and trying to understanding them. Part of the intelligence-health association has genetic origins. Recent advances in molecular genetic technology and statistical analyses have revealed that: intelligence and many health outcomes are highly polygenic; and that modest but widespread genetic correlations exist between intelligence and health, illness and mortality. Causal accounts of intelligence-health associations are still poorly understood. The contribution of education and socio-economic status\u2009-\u2009both of which are partly genetic in origin\u2009-\u2009to the intelligence-health associations are being explored.",

    "abstract": "Trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) is a relevant construct that could promote positive development in adolescents and may predict a number of affect-related outcomes. However, studies focused on its antecedents are still scarce. The main aim of this study is to examine the intergenerational transmission of trait EI from parents to adolescents and the mediating role of parental autonomy support and psychological control.\nOur sample was comprised of 152 cohabiting families, with adolescents (75 males and 77 females) between 16 and 17 years old (M\u202f=\u202f16.45; SD\u202f=\u202f0.50).\nResults suggested that paternal and maternal trait EI positively predicted paternal and maternal autonomy support and psychological control, and adolescent trait EI was predicted by maternal trait EI, adolescent perception of parental autonomy support and adolescent perception of parental psychological control. Adolescent perception of parental autonomy support and adolescent perception of parental psychological control were shown to act as mediators between adolescents' trait EI and paternal and maternal trait EI.\nThe results extend the literature on the role of parents in the development of trait EI and confirm the relevance of trait EI for affect-related outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Intelligence is an important quantitative trait associated with human cognitive ability. The genetic basis of intelligence remains unclear now. Utilizing the latest chromosomal enhancer maps of brain regions, we explored brain region related biological pathways associated with intelligence. Summary data was derived from a large scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of human, involving 78,308 unrelated individuals from 13 cohorts. The chromosomal enhancer maps of 8 brain regions were then aligned with the GWAS summary data to obtain the association testing results of enhancer regions for intelligence. Gene set enrichment analysis was then conducted to identify the biological pathways associated with intelligence for 8 brain regions, respectively. A total of 178 KEGG pathways was analyzed in this study. We detected multiple biological pathways showing cross brain regions or brain region specific association signals for human intelligence. For instance, KEGG_SYSTEMIC_LUPUS_ERYTHEMATOSUS pathway presented association signals for intelligence across 8 brain regions (all P value\u202f<\u202f0.01). KEGG_GLYCOSPHINGOLIPID_BIOSYNTHESIS_GANGLIO_SERIES was detected for 5 brain regions. We also identified several brain region specific pathways, such as AMINO_SUGAR_AND_NUCLEOTIDE_SUGAR_METABOLISM for Germinal Matrix (P value\u202f=\u202f0.009) and FRUCTOSE_AND_MANNOSE_METABOLISM for Anterior Caudate (P value\u202f=\u202f0.005). Our study results provided novel clues for understanding the genetic mechanism of intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Radiographic bone age assessment (BAA) is used in the evaluation of pediatric endocrine and metabolic disorders. We previously developed an automated artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning algorithm to perform BAA using convolutional neural networks. We compared the BAA performance of a cohort of pediatric radiologists with and without AI assistance.\nSix board-certified, subspecialty trained pediatric radiologists interpreted 280 age- and gender-matched bone age radiographs ranging from 5 to 18\u00a0years. Three of those radiologists then performed BAA with AI assistance. Bone age accuracy and root mean squared error (RMSE) were used as measures of accuracy. Intraclass correlation coefficient evaluated inter-rater variation.\nAI BAA accuracy was 68.2% overall and 98.6% within 1\u00a0year, and the mean six-reader cohort accuracy was 63.6 and 97.4% within 1\u00a0year. AI RMSE was 0.601\u00a0years, while mean single-reader RMSE was 0.661\u00a0years. Pooled RMSE decreased from 0.661 to 0.508\u00a0years, all individually decreasing with AI assistance. ICC without AI was 0.9914 and with AI was 0.9951.\nAI improves radiologist's bone age assessment by increasing accuracy and decreasing variability and RMSE. The utilization of AI by radiologists improves performance compared to AI alone, a radiologist alone, or a pooled cohort of experts. This suggests that AI may optimally be utilized as an adjunct to radiologist interpretation of imaging studies to improve performance.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to use natural language processing of physician documentation to predict mortality in patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care III database was used to obtain SICU stays with six different severity of illness scores. Natural language processing was performed on the physician notes. Classifiers for predicting mortality were created. One classifier used only the physician notes, one used only the severity of illness scores, and one used the physician notes with severity of injury scores. There were 3838 SICU stays identified during the study period and 5.4 per cent ended with mortality. The classifier trained with physician notes with severity of injury scores performed with the highest area under the curve (0.88 \u00b1 0.05) and accuracy (94.6 \u00b1 1.1%). The most important variable was the Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (16.0%). The most important terms were \"dilated\" (4.3%) and \"hemorrhage\" (3.7%). This study demonstrates the novel use of artificial intelligence to process physician documentation to predict mortality in the SICU. The classifiers were able to detect the subtle nuances in physician vernacular that predict mortality. These nuances provided improved performance in predicting mortality over physiologic parameters alone.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, new technologies, devices, and methods have been developed to assist in the diagnosis of cutaneous melanocytic lesions.\nOur objective was to evaluate the performance of an augmented intelligence system in the assessment of atypical pigmented lesions.\nNine atypical pigmented lesions on 8 patients were evaluated prior to surgical removal. No lesions had received previous treatment other than a diagnostic biopsy. Prior to surgical removal, each lesion was evaluated by an Augmented Intelligence Dermal Imager (AID) and the assessment parameters reviewed in light of the final histopathological diagnosis.\nThe AID was used to evaluate a limited set of atypical pigmented lesions and showed sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 61%, respectively, based on its internal risk assessment algorithms.\nThese cases represent early assessments of the AID in a clinical setting, all prior assessments having been carried out on digital images. The information received from these evaluations requires further validation and analysis to be able to extrapolate its clinical usefulness.\nThe AID combines dermoscopy, hypodermoscopy, and a trained augmented algorithm to produce a diffusion map representing the features of each lesion compared to the learned characteristics from a database of known dermoscopy images of lesions with definitive prior diagnosis. The information gathered from the diffusion map might be used to calculate a malignancy risk factor for the lesion compared to known melanoma features. This malignancy risk factor could be helpful in providing information to justify the biopsy of an atypical pigmented lesion.",

    "abstract": "Data on the relationship between intelligence quotient (IQ) and violence perpetration are scarce and nationally representative data from the UK adult population is lacking. Therefore, our goal was to examine the relationship between IQ and violence perpetration using nationally representative community-based data from the UK.\nWe analyzed cross-sectional data from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. IQ was estimated using the National Adult Reading Test (NART). Violence perpetration referred to being in a physical fight or having deliberately hit anyone in the past 5 years. We conducted logistic regression analysis to assess the association between IQ (exposure variable) and violence perpetration (outcome variable).\nThere were 6872 participants aged \u2a7e16 years included in this study. The prevalence of violence perpetration decreased linearly with increasing IQ [16.3% (IQ 70-79) v. 2.9% (IQ 120-129)]. After adjusting for demographic and behavioral factors, childhood adversity, and psychiatric morbidity, compared with those with IQ 120-129, IQ scores of 110-119, 100-109, 90-99, 80-89, and 70-79 were associated with 1.07 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-1.84], 1.90 (95% CI 1.12-3.22), 1.80 (95% CI 1.05-3.13), 2.36 (95% CI 1.32-4.22), and 2.25 (95% CI 1.26-4.01) times higher odds for violence perpetration, respectively.\nLower IQ was associated with violence perpetration in the UK general population. Further studies are warranted to assess how low IQ can lead to violence perpetration, and whether interventions are possible for this high-risk group.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated whether general intelligence could predict physical fitness and academic achievements one year later.\nWe recruited 129 Spanish adolescents (57.4% boys) with a mean age of 13.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0years old from a convenience sample of a single public-funded school. The first step was to assess general intelligence during the 2015-2016 school year using the D48 nonverbal test. A year later, we collected data on fitness and academic achievements. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured with the 20-m endurance shuttle run test, muscular strength with the standing long jump and flexibility with the sit and reach test. Academic achievement was measured using school grades. The findings were assessed using three models with different variables.\nOne year later, general intelligence at baseline was marginally significantly associated with flexibility (p\u00a0=\u00a00.079) and mathematics (p\u00a0=\u00a00.084) in the first model, with mathematics (p\u00a0=\u00a00.029) and geography and history (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) in the second model and with geography and history (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022) in the third model. All the analyses were controlled by age, sex, fitness and academic achievement.\nGeneral intelligence may not predict fitness, but it may predict academic achievements in adolescents one year later.

Ascertaining efficient embryo selection in order to secure optimal pregnancy rates remains the focus of the in vitro fertilization scientific community and the strongest driver behind innovative approaches. This scoping review aims to describe and analyze complex models based on mathematics for embryo selection, devices, and software most widely employed in the IVF laboratory and algorithms in the service of the cutting-edge technology of artificial intelligence. Despite their promising nature, the practicing embryologist is the one ultimately responsible for the success of the IVF laboratory and thus the one to approve embracing pioneering technologies in routine practice. Applied mathematics and computational biology have already provided significant insight into the selection of the most competent preimplantation embryo. This review describes the leap of evolution from basic mathematics to bioinformatics and investigates the possibility that computational applications may be the means to foretell a promising future for the IVF clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Thanks to the fast improvement of the computing power and the rapid development of the computational chemistry and biology, the computer-aided drug design techniques have been successfully applied in almost every stage of the drug discovery and development pipeline to speed up the process of research and reduce the cost and risk related to preclinical and clinical trials. Owing to the development of machine learning theory and the accumulation of pharmacological data, the artificial intelligence (AI) technology, as a powerful data mining tool, has cut a figure in various fields of the drug design, such as virtual screening, activity scoring, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis, de novo drug design, and in silico evaluation of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADME/T) properties. Although it is still challenging to provide a physical explanation of the AI-based models, it indeed has been acting as a great power to help manipulating the drug discovery through the versatile frameworks. Recently, due to the strong generalization ability and powerful feature extraction capability, deep learning methods have been employed in predicting the molecular properties as well as generating the desired molecules, which will further promote the application of AI technologies in the field of drug design.",

    "abstract": "Post-secondary students in training for helping profession disciplines, including nursing, may be at elevated risk for high stress levels. Stress among students has been linked with adverse physical and psychological health. In addition to the common stressors associated with post-secondary education, sources of stress for students in the helping professions include balancing academic and clinical demands. Previous research indicates perceived stress levels are correlated with emotional intelligence (EI) and with the coping strategies employed by students.\nThe aim of this study was to examine (1) the relationship between EI and perceived stress, and (2) the potential mediating role of coping responses.\nA cross-sectional survey design was employed.\nParticipants were recruited from a public university in the United States.\nA sample of 203 undergraduate and graduate students majoring in psychology, nursing, and social work was recruited.\nParticipants were recruited on-campus and through campus online resources and completed an online survey or a paper-and-pencil version of the survey. Descriptive statistics and mediation analyses were used to test the study hypotheses.\nHigher EI was associated with lower perceived stress, and this association was partially mediated by both adaptive and maladaptive coping responses. Higher EI was associated with greater use of adaptive coping and lower use of maladaptive coping, and these, in turn, were negatively and positively (respectively) associated with perceived stress.\nThe findings suggest that interventions aimed at increasing emotional intelligence may help to reduce perceived stress for students in the helping disciplines.",

    "abstract": "We used artificial intelligence to develop a novel algorithm using physiomarkers to predict the onset of severe sepsis in critically ill children.\nObservational cohort study.\nPICU.\nChildren age between 6 and 18 years old.\nNone.\nContinuous minute-by-minute physiologic data were available for a total of 493 critically ill children admitted to a tertiary care PICU over an 8-month period, 20 of whom developed severe sepsis. Using an alert time stamp generated by an electronic screening algorithm as a reference point, we studied up to 24 prior hours of continuous physiologic data. We identified physiomarkers, including SD of heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and symbolic transitions probabilities of those variables that discriminated severe sepsis patients from controls (all other patients admitted to the PICU who did not meet severe sepsis criteria). We used logistic regression, random forests, and deep Convolutional Neural Network methods to derive our models. Analysis was performed using data generated in two windows prior to the firing of the electronic screening algorithm, namely, 2-8 and 8-24 hours. When analyzing the physiomarkers present in the 2-8 hours analysis window, logistic regression performed with specificity of 87.4% and sensitivity of 55.0%, random forest performed with 79.6% specificity and 80.0% sensitivity, and the Convolutional Neural Network performed with 83.0% specificity and 75.0% sensitivity. When analyzing physiomarkers from the 8-24 hours window, logistic regression resulted in 77.1% specificity and 39.3% sensitivity, random forest performed with 82.3% specificity and 61.1% sensitivity, whereas the Convolutional Neural Network method achieved 81% specificity and 76% sensitivity.\nArtificial intelligence can be used to predict the onset of severe sepsis using physiomarkers in critically ill children. Further, it may detect severe sepsis as early as 8 hours prior to a real-time electronic severe sepsis screening algorithm.",

    "abstract": "To examine the association between maternal intelligence quotient (IQ) and early childhood motor development and whether maternal education mediates this relationship.\nData were collected prospectively in the Ma'anshan Birth Cohort study. Maternal IQ was assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised by China (WAIS-RC). Information on baseline characteristics and maternal education was obtained from questionnaires and medical records. The study outcome was motor development evaluated at 18\u2009months by the Third Edition of Ages and Stages Questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses and mediation analyses were used.\nOf 2739 valid subjects (84% follow-up), the rate of developmental delay was 3.1% in the gross motor domain and 6.2% in the fine motor domain. The mean value for maternal IQ was 96.2 (standard deviation 10.6). About 40.3% of the mothers had secondary education or less, while 59.7% had a college education. Mothers with higher IQ had a significantly higher educational level and had children with better motor development. Maternal education significantly mediated the association between maternal IQ and fine motor development. There was a direct effect of maternal IQ on gross motor development, but the mediation effect of maternal education was not found.\nMaternal IQ was associated with motor development. Maternal education played an important role in reducing the disparities in fine motor development among children of different maternal IQs.",

Mothers with higher IQ had a significantly higher educational level and had children with better motor development. Maternal education significantly mediated the association between maternal IQ and fine motor development.

    "abstract": "Given the many instances of violence and crime that occur as a consequence of psychopathy, it is vital to find those variables that can reduce the expression of such behaviors. In this regard, one potentially useful variable is that known as Emotional Intelligence (EI) or the ability to perceive, use, understand, and regulate emotions. EI has been categorized according to three main approaches: performance-based ability, self-report ability, and self-report mixed models. Given the emotional deficits of the psychopathic population, EI could be a protective factor. Several studies have analyzed the relationship between EI and psychopathy, but the results are unclear. This disparity may be due to the EI model employed to measure EI. The aim of our research is to systematically review the relationship between the different models of EI and psychopathy, both in the total and clinical/inmate sample. We searched Scopus, Pubmed, and PsicINFO to find relevant articles. Twenty-nine eligible studies were found. They were divided according to the model of EI and the sample used. The results for the total sample differ according to the measure of EI: when the performance-based ability model is used, the majority of studies find a negative relationship between EI and psychopathy. When using self-reports, the results are inconsistent. The findings with the clinical/inmate sample are in the same direction as the total sample. In conclusion, the results suggest that higher EI abilities measured through performance-based ability models-but not through self-reports-are related to lower psychopathy deficits. Limitations and clinical implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have investigated associations of milestone development in early childhood with intelligence in adulthood in typically developing children. The current study is an extension of 2 previous studies on smaller samples and investigated associations of age at attainment of 32 developmental milestones attained between 0 and 3 years of age with adult intelligence and explored whether the effects of early infant milestones are mediated through later development during subsequent years. Mothers of 8,400 children from the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort recorded 32 developmental milestones during the child's first 3 years of life. Information on at least 1 developmental milestone was available for 2 subsamples with adult follow-up information on intelligence: B\u00f8rge Priens Pr\u00f8ve (BPP) was available for 2,567 men while Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) was available for 1,000 men and women. The study found that early attainment of milestones, primarily those related to standing/walking and language development, was associated with higher intelligence in adulthood. The adjusted BPP means were 103.7, 101.7, and 99.5, respectively, for being able to name objects/animals in pictures at less than 18 months, 18-24 months, and later than 24 months. Mediation analyses showed direct associations of the 1-year milestones related to standing/walking with intelligence with the direct association accounting for 74.6% and 64.4% of the total association in each subsample. Thus, milestones related to standing and walking primarily show a direct association with adult intelligence and are to a smaller extent mediated by milestones reflecting development during the subsequent years, in particular language development.

    "abstract": "The current study evaluated the relationship between positive and negative emotions, trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) and difficulties in career decision-making. We examined whether trait EI could predict career indecisiveness, a type of career decision-making difficulty, over and above the \"Big Five\" personality traits. We also examined the mechanism through which trait EI affected career indecisiveness by investigating the mediating role of positive and negative emotions. Survey data were collected from a sample of 600 undergraduate students in a university in southwest United States, who completed questionnaires measuring trait EI, positive emotions, negative emotions, personality traits, and career indecisiveness. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that trait EI accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in career indecisiveness that was not explained by the \"Big Five\" personality traits. The parallel mediation analysis revealed that positive and negative emotions partially mediated the relationship between trait EI and career indecisiveness. Using the framework of Fredrickson's (2001) broaden and build theory of positive emotions, the study provides empirical evidence explaining the mechanism through which trait EI helps individuals cope better with challenging situations in life. Trait EI aids the elicitation of positive emotions and the down-regulation of negative emotions, which, in turn, broaden the range of thoughts and actions that come to mind, helping individuals function more effectively in the context of career decision-making. Implications for career counseling and opportunities for further research are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Even after making allowance for an unprecedented hype, it is an undeniable fact that, in the coming decade, deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will cause a paradigm shift in the delivery of healthcare. This paper will review the practical utility of AI in neurosciences from a clinician's perspective. Steering clear of the complex, technical, computational jargon, the authors will critically review the exponential development in this area from a clinical standpoint. The reader will be exposed to the fundamentals of AI in healthcare and its applications in different areas of neurosciences. Powerful AI techniques can unlock clinically relevant information, hidden in massive amounts of data. Translating technical computational success to meaningful clinical impact is, however, a challenge. AI requires a thorough and systematic evaluation, prior to integration in the clinical care. Like other disruptive technologies in the past, its potential for causing a great impact should not be underestimated. A scenario in which medical information, gathered at the point of care, is analyzed using sophisticated machine algorithms to provide real-time actionable analytics seems to be within touching distance.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence is the ability of an individual to assess and control emotions in oneself and others and also use this information in ongoing coping methods. Emotional intelligence is known to have an effect on the success rate of an individual as well as job performance and satisfaction. Though contradictory, emotional intelligence is supposed to have multiple factors affecting it. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Shiraz University of Medical Sciences has an effect on the emotional intelligence of its medical students and also whether the students' emotional intelligence had a relationship with their gender, hometown, and application exam rank or cumulative grade point average. Junior and senior medical students were approached from Autumn (2016) until winter 2017 and asked if they would fill out the Persian translation of TEIQue-SF questionnaire. They were also asked to inform us about their gender, educational region, cumulative grade point average, and Konkoor rank. The data was later analyzed by SPSS ver. 22. A significant difference was found between emotional intelligence of junior and senior medical students. No significant difference was found between emotional intelligence of male and female participants and there was no relation between emotional intelligence and Konkoor rank, cumulative grade point average, and educational region. The results showed that medical education has a negative effect the emotional intelligence. Males and females in this study had the same emotional intelligence that suggests the social effects on emotional intelligence. Also, the net effect of hometown and culture was not significant enough to influence emotional intelligence. As we analyzed the relationship of emotional intelligence and cumulative grade point average, it was concluded that the academic success of the students which is based on their scores is not related to their emotional intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the fastest growing developmental disability diagnosis. General practitioners (GPs) and family physicians are typically the first point of contact for patients or family members concerned with ASD traits observed in themselves or their family member. Unfortunately, some families and adult patients are unaware of ASD traits that may be exhibited and as a result do not seek out necessary diagnostic services or contact their GP. Therefore, providing a quick, accessible, and simple tool utilizing items related to ASD to these families may increase the likelihood they will seek professional assessment and is vital to the early detection and treatment of ASD. This study aims at identifying fewer, albeit influential, features in common ASD screening methods in order to achieve efficient screening as demands on evaluating the items' influences on ASD within existing tools is urgent. To achieve this aim, a computational intelligence method called Variable Analysis (Va) is proposed that considers feature-to-class correlations and reduces feature-to-feature correlations. The results of the Va have been verified using two machine learning algorithms by deriving automated classification systems with respect to specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive values (PPVs), negative predictive values (NPVs), and predictive accuracy. Experimental results using cases and controls related to items in three common screening methods, along with features related to individuals, have been analysed and compared with results obtained from other common filtering methods. The results exhibited that Va was able to derive fewer numbers of features from adult, adolescent, and child screening methods yet maintained competitive predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates.",

EI has long been recognized as a critical component for individual and organizational success within the business realm, and there is emerging evidence that enhancing EI is equally important in the medical setting. EI can improve interpersonal communications, enable constructive conflict resolution, and promote a culture of professionalism. As healthcare becomes increasingly team-based, proficiency in EI will be required to build consensus among multidisciplinary stakeholders, and effect change in attitudes and behaviors that result in improved patient safety and clinical outcomes. Based on the existing literature and the authors' experiences, these 12 tips provide practical suggestions on how to introduce EI into a medical curriculum. These tips have broad applicability, and can be implemented in courses on topics such as professionalism, leadership development, empathy, patient safety, or wellness.",

    "abstract": "Infancy is the most dynamic part of human development. During this period, all basic sensorimotor and cognitive abilities are established. In this chapter, we will trace some of the important achievements of this development with a focus on how infants achieve predictive control of actions, i.e., how they come to coordinate their behavior with the ongoing events in the world without lagging behind. With the maturation of\u00a0the brain, new possibilities that have profound effects on cognition open up. Some of them are core abilities, i.e., they function at birth or very early in development. Important examples are the structured perception of objects and surfaces and the\u00a0control of arm movements. Closely after birth, infants move their arms to the vicinity of objects in front of them demonstrating that they have some control of their\u00a0arms and indicating that they perceive objects as such. Another example is the rapid onset of smooth-pursuit eye movements during the second month of life and the emerging ability to predict when and where an occluded moving object will reappear. At\u00a04months of age, out of sight is no longer of mind. The child's sensorimotor system\u00a0is especially designed to facilitate the extraction of knowledge about the world\u00a0including other people. In addition, the infant is endowed with motives that ensure that the innate predispositions are transformed into a system of knowledge for guiding actions predictively. By perceiving and acting on the world, infants develop their cognition and through developmental studies; we can learn more about these processes.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the study is to assess whether Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) prior to pregnancy is associated with fluid intelligence in offspring. Additionally, perinatal and obstetric outcomes, and children nutritional status were evaluated.\nSingleton births of women who underwent RYGB between 2000 and 2010 (BS) were matched to two control births by maternal age, delivery year, and gender. Control group 1 (CG1) and control group 2 (CG2) included women with a pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) <\u200935\u00a0kg/m\nThirty-two children from each group (n\u2009=\u200996) were analyzed, mostly female (59%) and Caucasian (82%), with a mean age of 7\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0years. Their general intelligence scores were similar after adjusting for sociodemographic confounders; family economic class was the strongest predictor (low: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u200920.57; p\u2009<\u20090.001; middle: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u20099.34; p\u2009=\u20090.019). Gestational diabetes mellitus (OR 0.06; 95% CI 0.03; 0.35) and hypertensive disorders (OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01; 0.40) were less frequent in BS than CG2.

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence support that complete cytoreduction (CC) at the time of secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCS) improves survival in patients affected by recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC). Here, we aimed to determine whether artificial intelligence (AI) might be useful in weighting the importance of clinical variables predicting CC and survival.\nThis is a retrospective study evaluating 194 patients having SCS for ROC. Using artificial neuronal network (ANN) analysis was estimated the importance of different variables, used in predicting CC and survival. ANN simulates a biological neuronal system. Like neurons, ANN acquires knowledge through a learning-phase process and allows weighting the importance of covariates, thus establishing how much a variable influences a multifactor phenomenon.\nOverall, 82.9% of patients had CC at the time of SCS. Using ANN, we observed that the 3 main factors driving the ability of achieve CC included: disease-free interval (DFI) (importance: 0.231), retroperitoneal recurrence (importance: 0.178), residual disease at primary surgical treatment (importance: 0.138), and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage at presentation (importance: 0.088). Looking at connections between different covariates and overall survival (OS), we observed that DFI is the most important variable influencing OS (importance: 0.306). Other important variables included: CC (importance: 0.217), and FIGO stage at presentation (importance: 0.100).\nAccording to our results, DFI should be considered as the most important factor predicting both CC and OS. Further studies are needed to estimate the clinical utility of AI in providing help in decision making process.",

    "abstract": "Facing metastasis is the most pressing challenge of cancer research. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells, highlighting the kinetics of cancer stem cell and the role of the epithelial mesenchymal transition for metastasis. It appears that the tumor micro-environment plays a crucial role in triggering phenotypic transitions, as we illustrate discussing the challenges posed by macrophages and cancer associated fibroblasts. To disentangle the complexity of environmentally induced phenotypic transitions, there is a growing need for novel advanced algorithms as those proposed in our recent work combining single cell data analysis and numerical simulations of gene regulatory networks. We conclude discussing recent developments in artificial intelligence and its applications to personalized cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between the general factor of intelligence (g) and handedness is investigated using a combined sample of 23511 respondents from three large databases: the NLSY'79 (US), NLSY'97 (US) and NCDS (UK). Dextrals - those who use their right hands were found to be 1.22 IQ points higher than sinistrals (left handers) after controlling for sex and age and correcting for sources of measurement error. To see if the association between IQ and handedness was strongest on the abilities that were the best measures of g, the method of correlated vectors was used to test for moderation. Across the three studies, g was found to very weakly negatively moderate the association between ability measure and handedness (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f-.023, K\u202f=\u202f3, N\u202f=\u202f23511), however in the NLSY'79, the coding speed subtest was an outlier in terms of the strength of its association with handedness. Its removal yielded indications of positive moderation in this dataset, which when aggregated boosted the overall vector correlation value to .539 (K\u202f=\u202f3, N\u202f=\u202f23511), suggesting that g might be an important moderator of this relationship. Secondary analysis of secular trend data on the changing percentage of sinistrals in Western populations indicates that overall, sinistrality has increased, entailing a g decline of .106 points over 150\u202fyears (.006 points per decade). The secular increase in sinistrality is consistent with other data indicating long-term declines in developmental stability and may stem from some combination of increasing mutation load and environmental stress in Western populations.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is already widely employed in various medical roles, and ongoing technological advances are encouraging more widespread use of AI in imaging. This is partly driven by the recognition of the significant frequency and clinical impact of human errors in radiology reporting, and the promise that AI can help improve the reliability as well the efficiency of imaging interpretation. AI in imaging was first envisioned in the 1960s, but initial attempts were limited by the technology of the day. It was the introduction of artificial neural networks and AI based computer aided detection (CAD) software in the 1980s that marked the advent of widespread integration of AI within radiology reporting. CAD is now routinely used in mammography, with consistent evidence of equivalent or improved lesion detection, with small increases in recall rates. Significant false positive rates remain a limitation for CAD, although these have markedly improved in the last decade. Other challenges include the difficulty clinicians encounter in trying to understand the reasoning of an AI system, which may limit their confidence in its advice, and a question mark hangs over who should be liable if CAD makes an error. The future integration of CAD with PACS promises the development of more comprehensively intelligent systems that can identify multiple, challenging diagnoses, and a move towards more individualised patient outcome predictions based upon AI analysis.",

    "abstract": "Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) research has grown rapidly over the past few years, in part thanks to the numerous successes of modern machine learning techniques such as deep learning, the availability of large datasets and improvements in computing power. AI is proving to be increasingly applicable to healthcare and there is a growing list of tasks where algorithms have matched or surpassed physician performance. Despite the successes there remain significant concerns and challenges surrounding algorithm opacity, trust and patient data security. Notwithstanding these challenges, AI technologies will likely become increasingly integrated into emergency medicine in the coming years. This perspective presents an overview of current AI research relevant to emergency medicine.",

    "abstract": "All the genetic potential and the intelligence a bacteria can showcase in a given environment are embedded in its genome. In this study, we have presented systematic guidelines to understand a bacterial genome with the relevant set of in silico tools using a novel bacteria as an example. This study presents a multi-dimensional approach from genome annotation to tracing genes and their network of metabolism operating in an organism. It also shows how the sequence can be used to mine the enzymes and construction of its 3-dimensional structure so that its functional behavior can be predicted and compared. The discriminating algorithm allows analysis of the promoter region and provides the insight in the regulation of genes in spite of the similarity in its sequences. The ecological niche specific bacterial behavior and adapted altered physiology can be understood through the presence of secondary metabolite, antibiotic resistance genes, and viral genes; and it helps in the valorization of genetic information for developing new biological application/processes. This study provides an in silico work plan and necessary steps for genome analysis of novel bacteria without any rigorous wet lab experiments.",

    "abstract": "Considerable work in recent years has examined the relationship between cortical thickness (CT) and general intelligence (IQ) in healthy individuals. It is not known whether specific IQ variables (i.e., perceptual reasoning [PIQ], verbal comprehension IQ [VIQ], and full-scale IQ [FSIQ]) are associated with multiple cortical measures (i.e., CT, cortical volume (CV), cortical surface area (CSA) and cortical gyrification (CG)) within the same individuals. Here we examined the association between these neuroimaging metrics and IQ in 56 healthy adults. At a cluster-forming threshold (CFT) of p\u202f<\u202f0.05, we observed significant positive relationships between CT and all three IQ variables in regions within the posterior frontal and superior parietal lobes. Regions within the temporal and posterior frontal lobes exhibited positive relationships between CV and two IQ variables (PIQ and FSIQ) and regions within the inferior parietal lobe exhibited positive relationships between CV and PIQ. Additionally, CV was positively associated with VIQ in the left insula and with FSIQ within the inferior frontal gyrus. At a more stringent CFT (p\u202f<\u202f0.01), the CT-PIQ, CT-VIQ, CT-FSIQ, and CV-PIQ relationships remained significant within the posterior frontal lobe, as did the CV-PIQ relationship within the temporal and inferior parietal lobes. We did not observe statistically significant relationships between IQ and either CSA or CG. Our findings suggest that the neural basis of IQ extends beyond previously observed relationships with fronto-parietal regions. We also conclude that CT and CV may be more useful metrics than CSA or CG in the study of intellectual abilities.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is highly prevalent among doctors worldwide. However, no research has been done to examine the associations of emotional intelligence (EI) and emotional labor strategy with fatigue among Chinese doctors. This study aimed to examine whether or not emotional labor strategy mediates the association between EI and fatigue in this occupational group.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted in Shenyang from March to April 2014. A set of self-administered questionnaires was distributed to 950 doctors, including Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS), Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS) and a 14-item emotional labor scale. Complete responses were obtained from 740 (77.9%) participants. Hierarchical linear regression was performed to examine the associations of EI and emotional labor strategies (surface acting, SA; deep acting, DA; natural acting, NA) with fatigue. Asymptotic and resampling strategies were used to examine the mediating roles of emotional labor strategies.\nThe mean score of fatigue was 8.02 (SD\u2009=\u20093.39). After adjusting for age, gender, marital status, job rank, monthly income, weekly working time, shift and department, EI was negatively associated with fatigue (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.270, P\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.001). SA was positively associated with fatigue (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.168, P\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.001), whereas NA was negatively associated with fatigue (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.105, P\u2009=\u20090.004); however, DA was not significantly associated with fatigue (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.034, P\u2009=\u20090.381). Thus, SA (a\u2009\u00d7\u2009b\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.026, BCa 95% CI: -\u00a00.050, -\u20090.011) and NA (a\u2009\u00d7\u2009b\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.024, BCa 95% CI: -\u00a00.046, -\u20090.006) significantly mediated the association between EI and fatigue, respectively.\nThere was a high level of fatigue among Chinese doctors. EI could indirectly reduce fatigue partially through modifying SA and NA strategies, respectively. EI intervention, education and training in emotional labor should be carried out to cope with fatigue.",

    "abstract": "Pain and emotional well-being are complexly associated both globally and in the moment. Emotional regulation strategies may contribute to that complexity by shaping the pain-well-being association.\nUsing emotional intelligence (EI) as an integrative conceptual framework, this study probed the role of emotional regulation in the associations of osteoarthritis pain with emotional well-being in varying time frames. Perceived attention to, clarity, and regulation of emotions were examined as predictors of well-being, and as moderators of the well-being-pain association, at global and momentary (within-day) levels.\nIn a microlongitudinal study, 218 older adults with physician-diagnosed knee osteoarthritis self-reported global pain, depressive symptoms, and EI (mood attention, clarity, and repair). Momentary pain and positive and negative affect were then assessed four times daily for 7 days. EI subscales were examined as moderators of the pain-well-being association at global and momentary levels, controlling demographics and general health.\nGlobal and momentary pain were positively associated with mood clarity and negatively with attention, but not with repair. Clarity and repair negatively predicted depression, and buffered effects of pain on depression. Momentary negative affect was negatively predicted by mood clarity and repair; again, clarity and mood repair buffered effects of momentary pain on negative affect. Only mood repair predicted positive affect, with no interactions emerging.\nAttention to mood states exacerbates the experience of pain in both short and long terms. In contrast, both mood clarity and ability to repair moods appear important to both momentary and longer-term emotional well-being.",

    "abstract": "The overall purpose of this study was to examine the mediating effects of parents' coping strategies on the relationship between parents' emotional intelligence and sideline verbal behaviors during their children's soccer games. Participants were 232 parents (120 mothers and 110 fathers) of youth soccer players age 9-13 years. Observations in situ were carried out at 30 soccer games during a soccer tournament. At the end of the game, parents were approached and asked to complete the Emotional Intelligence Scale and the Brief COPE scale. Structural-equation-modeling analyses revealed that adaptive and maladaptive coping mediated the relationship between regulation of emotion and parents' praise/encouragement, and negative and derogatory comments during the game. In addition, game result moderated the relationships between emotional intelligence, coping strategies, and parent behaviors. Emotional regulation and adaptive coping may promote desirable parent sideline behaviors and reduce undesirable behaviors.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the relationship between macular vessel density and ganglion cell to inner plexiform layer thickness (GCIPLT) and to compare their diagnostic performance. We attempted to develop a new combined parameter using an artificial neural network.\nA total of 173 subjects: 100 for the test and 73 for neural net training. The test group consisted of 32 healthy, 33 early, and 35 advanced glaucoma subjects. Macular GCIPLT and vessel density were measured using Spectralis optical coherence tomography and Topcon swept-source optical coherence tomography, respectively. Various regression models were used to investigate the relationships between macular vessel density and GCIPLT. A multilayer neural network with one hidden layer was used to determine a single combined parameter. To compare diagnostic performance, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).\nCorrelation analyses in all subjects showed a significant correlation between macular vessel density and GCIPLT in all sectors (r=0.27 to 0.56; all Ps\u22640.006). The fitness of linear, quadratic, and exponential regression models showed clinically negligible differences (Akaike's information criterion=714.6, 713.8, and 713.3, respectively) and were almost linear. In differentiating normal and early glaucoma, the diagnostic power of macular GCIPLT (AUROC=0.67 to 0.81) was much better than that of macular vessel density (AUROC=0.50 to 0.60). However, when vessel density information was incorporated into GCIPLT using the neural network, the combined parameter (AUROC=0.87) showed significantly enhanced diagnostic performance than all sectors of macular vessel density and GCIPLT (all Ps\u22640.043).\nMacular vessel density was significantly decreased in glaucoma patients and showed an almost linear correlation with macular GCIPLT. The diagnostic performance of macular vessel density was much lower than that of macular GCIPLT. However, when incorporated into macular GCIPLT using an artificial neural network, the combined parameter showed better performance than macular GCIPLT alone.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between aggressive behaviour and individual levels of ability emotional intelligence (EI). Three hundred and ninety-five participants took part in this study. Participants were assessed on ability EI, negative affect (NA), and aggression by the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Buss-Perry Aggression questionnaires, respectively. The results revealed a negative relationship between aggression and ability EI, but this relationship depended on multiple factors: the type of EI branches and aggression dimensions, the influence of NA, and gender. Emotional management ability showed a direct relationship with aggression, while emotional perception ability presented an indirect relationship with aggression through the effect of NA. These EI abilities were related to different aggression dimensions, highlighting the direct relationship with physical aggression. Moreover, gender differences showed that women possess greater EI abilities, higher levels of NA, less aggressive behaviour, and a lower relationship between NA and aggression compared with men. This research offers a better understanding of the psychological processes explaining aggression. The inclusion of our findings in the design of prevention and treatment programs could be of great help in the control of aggressive behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0has the potential to ease the human resources crisis in healthcare by facilitating diagnostics, decision-making, big data analytics and administration, among others. For this we must first tackle the technological, ethical and legal obstacles.The human resource crisis is widening worldwide, and it is obvious that it is not possible to provide care without workforce. How can disruptive technologies in healthcare help solve the variety of human resource problems? Will technology empower physicians or replace them? How can the medical curriculum, including post-graduate education prepare professionals for the meaningful use of technology? These questions have been growing for decades, and the promise of disruptive technologies filling them is imminent with digital health becoming widespread. Authors of this essay argue that AI might not only fill the human resources gap, but also raises ethical questions we need to deal with today.While there are even more questions to address, our stand is that AI is not meant to replace caregivers, but those who use AI will probably replace those who don't. And it is possible to prepare for that.",

    "abstract": "The big data revolution, accompanied by the development and deployment of wearable medical devices and mobile health applications, has enabled the biomedical community to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to vast amounts of data. This shift has created new research opportunities in predictive analytics, precision medicine, virtual diagnosis, patient monitoring, and drug discovery and delivery, which has garnered the interests of government, academic, and industry researchers alike and is already putting new tools in the hands of practitioners. This boom in digital health opportunities has also raised numerous questions concerning the future of biomedical research and healthcare practices. How reliable are deployed AI-driven diagnostic tools, and what is the impact of these tools on doctors and patients? How vulnerable are algorithms to bias and unfairness? How can research improve the process of detecting unfairness in machine learning algorithms? How are other fields simultaneously advancing AI applications? How will academia prepare scientists with the skills to meet the demands of the newly transformed industry? Informed answers to these and other questions require interdisciplinary discussion and collaboration. On February 13 and 14, 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine convened a workshop to explore these and other questions related to the emerging use of AI and machine learning technologies in translational research. This publication summarizes the presentations and discussions from the workshop.",
