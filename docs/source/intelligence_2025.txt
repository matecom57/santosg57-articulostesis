    "abstract": "Lung ultrasound (LUS) aids in the diagnosis of patients with dyspnea, including those with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, but requires technical proficiency for image acquisition. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in guiding novice users to acquire high-quality cardiac ultrasound images, suggesting its potential for broader use in LUS.\nTo evaluate the ability of AI to guide acquisition of diagnostic-quality LUS images by trained health care professionals (THCPs).\nIn this multicenter diagnostic validation study conducted between July 2023 and December 2023, participants aged 21 years or older with shortness of breath recruited from 4 clinical sites underwent 2 ultrasound examinations: 1 examination by a THCP operator using Lung Guidance AI and the other by a trained LUS expert without AI. The THCPs (including medical assistants, respiratory therapists, and nurses) underwent standardized AI training for LUS acquisition before participation.\nLung Guidance AI software uses deep learning algorithms guiding LUS image acquisition and B-line annotation. Using an 8-zone LUS protocol, the AI software automatically captures images of diagnostic quality.\nThe primary end point was the proportion of THCP-acquired examinations of diagnostic quality according to a panel of 5 masked expert LUS readers, who provided remote review and ground truth validation.\nThe intention-to-treat analysis included 176 participants (81 female participants [46.0%]; mean [SD] age, 63 [14] years; mean [SD] body mass index, 31 [8]). Overall, 98.3% (95% CI, 95.1%-99.4%) of THCP-acquired studies were of diagnostic quality, with no statistically significant difference in quality compared to LUS expert-acquired studies (difference, 1.7%; 95% CI, -1.6% to 5.0%).\nIn this multicenter validation study, THCPs with AI assistance achieved LUS images meeting diagnostic standards compared with LUS experts without AI. This technology could extend access to LUS to underserved areas lacking expert personnel.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05992324.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to validate a clinically available artificial intelligence (AI) model to assist general radiologists in the detection of intracranial aneurysm (IA) in a multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) study, and to explore its performance in routine clinical settings.\nTwo distinct cohorts of head CT angiography (CTA) data were assembled to validate an AI model. Cohort 1, comprising gold-standard consecutive CTA cases, was used in an MRMC study involving six board-certified general radiologists. Cohort 2, representing clinical CTA cases, was used to simulate a routine clinical setting. Following these evaluations, an algorithmic audit was conducted to identify any unusual or unexpected behaviors exhibited by the model.\nCohort 1 consisted of 131 CTA cases, while Cohort 2 included 515 CTA cases. In the MRMC study, the AI-assisted strategy demonstrated a significant improvement in aneurysm diagnostic performance, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increasing from 0.815 (95%CI: 0.754-0.875) to 0.875 (95%CI: 0.831-0.921; p\u2009=\u20090.008). In the AI-based first-reader study, 60.4% of the CTA cases were identified as negative by the AI, with a high negative predictive value of 0.994 (95%CI: 0.977-0.999). The algorithmic audit highlighted two issues for improvement: the accurate detection of tiny aneurysms and the effective exclusion of false-positive lesions.\nThis study highlights the clinical utility of a high-performance AI model in detecting IAs, significantly improving general radiologists' diagnostic performance with the potential to reduce their workload in routine clinical practice. The algorithmic audit offers insights to guide the development and validation of future AI models.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) reading digital mammograms in increasing the chance of detecting missed breast cancer, by studying the AI- flagged early morphology indictors, overlooked by the radiologist, and correlating them with the missed cancer pathology types.\nMammograms done in 2020-2023, presenting breast carcinomas (n\u202f=\u202f1998), were analyzed in concordance with the prior one year's result (2019-2022) assumed negative or benign. Present mammograms reviewed for the descriptors: asymmetry, distortion, mass, and microcalcifications. The AI presented abnormalities by overlaying color hue and scoring percentage for the degree of suspicion of malignancy.\nPrior mammogram with AI marking compromised 54\u202f% (n\u202f=\u202f555), and in the present mammograms, AI targeted 904 (88\u202f%) carcinomas. The descriptor proportion of \"asymmetry\" was the common presentation of missed breast carcinoma (64.1\u202f%) in the prior mammograms and the highest detection rate for AI was presented by \"distortion\" (100\u202f%) followed by \"grouped microcalcifications\" (80\u202f%). AI performance to predict malignancy in previously assigned negative or benign mammograms showed sensitivity of 73.4\u202f%, specificity of 89\u202f%, and accuracy of 78.4\u202f%.\nReading mammograms with AI significantly enhances the detection of early cancerous changes, particularly in dense breast tissues. The AI's detection rate does not correlate with specific pathological types of breast cancer, highlighting its broad utility. Subtle mammographic changes in postmenopausal women, not corroborated by ultrasound but marked by AI, warrant further evaluation by advanced applications of digital mammograms and close interval AI-reading mammogram follow up to minimize the potential for missed breast carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to permeate most industries, including medicine, and patients will inevitably start using these large language model (LLM) chatbots as a modality for education. As healthcare information technology evolves, it is imperative to evaluate chatbots and the accuracy of the information they provide to patients and to determine if there is variability between them.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and comprehensiveness of three chatbots in addressing questions related to endometriosis and determine the level of variability between them.\nThree LLMs, including Chat GPT-4 (Open AI), Claude (Anthropic), and Bard (Google) were asked to generate answers to 10 commonly asked questions about endometriosis. The responses were qualitatively compared to current guidelines and expert opinion on endometriosis and rated on a scale by nine gynecologists. The grading scale included the following: (1) Completely incorrect, (2) mostly incorrect and some correct, (3) mostly correct and some incorrect, (4) correct but inadequate, (5) correct and comprehensive. Final scores were averaged between the nine reviewers. Kendall's \nAverage scores for the 10 answers amongst Bard, Chat GPT, and Claude were 3.69, 4.24, and 3.7, respectively. Two questions showed significant disagreement between the nine reviewers. There were no questions the models could answer comprehensively or correctly across the reviewers. The model most associated with comprehensive and correct responses was ChatGPT. Chatbots showed an improved ability to accurately answer questions about symptoms and pathophysiology over treatment and risk of recurrence.\nThe analysis of LLMs revealed that, on average, they mainly provided correct but inadequate responses to commonly asked patient questions about endometriosis. While chatbot responses can serve as valuable supplements to information provided by licensed medical professionals, it is crucial to maintain a thorough ongoing evaluation process for outputs to provide the most comprehensive and accurate information to patients. Further research into this technology and its role in patient education and treatment is crucial as generative AI becomes more embedded in the medical field.",

    "abstract": "Journals and publishers are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to screen submissions for potential misconduct, including plagiarism and data or image manipulation. While using AI can enhance the integrity of published manuscripts, it can also increase the risk of false/unsubstantiated allegations. Ambiguities related to journals' and publishers' responsibilities concerning fairness and transparency also raise ethical concerns. In this Topic Piece, we offer the following guidance: (1) All cases of suspected misconduct identified by AI tools should be carefully reviewed by humans to verify accuracy and ensure accountability; (2) Journals/publishers that use AI tools to detect misconduct should use only well-tested and reliable tools, remain vigilant concerning forms of misconduct that cannot be detected by these tools, and stay abreast of advancements in technology; (3) Journals/publishers should inform authors about irregularities identified by AI tools and give them a chance to respond before forwarding allegations to their institutions in accordance with Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines; (4) Journals/publishers that use AI tools to detect misconduct should screen all relevant submissions and not just random/purposefully selected submissions; and (5) Journals should inform authors about their definition of misconduct, their use of AI tools to detect misconduct, and their policies and procedures for responding to suspected cases of misconduct.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to create a risk prediction model with artificial intelligence (AI) to identify patients at higher risk of postpartum hemorrhage using perinatal characteristics that may be associated with later postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in twin pregnancies that underwent cesarean section. The study was planned as a retrospective cohort study at University Hospital. All twin cesarean deliveries were categorized into two groups: those with and without PPH. Using the perinatal characteristics of the cases, four different machine learning classifiers were created: Logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). LR, RF, and SVM models were created a second time by including class weights to manage the underlying imbalances in the data. A total of 615 twin pregnancies were included in the study. There were 150 twin pregnancies with PPH and 465 without PPH. Dichorionity, PAS, and placenta previa were significantly higher in the PPH-positive group (",

    "abstract": "In healthcare settings, particularly in intensive care units, nurses face significant stress due to the high demands of their job. This stress can impact their job satisfaction, mental health, and overall quality of life. Emotional intelligence has been identified as a crucial factor that can mitigate workplace stress and enhance job satisfaction. Moreover, work-life balance is increasingly recognized as a critical factor influencing job satisfaction in the nursing profession.\nOur study aims at understanding the mediating effect of work-life balance between emotional intelligence and job satisfaction in Lebanese nurses working in the Intensive Care Unit.\nThis study has a cross-sectional design.\nNurses working in intensive care units of one hospital (n\u2009=\u2009100) were asked to fill an online questionnaire which included the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, Work-Life Balance Self-Assessment Scale, and Job Satisfaction Scale.\nWork Interference with Personal Life and Personal Life Interference with Work acted as significant mediators between emotional intelligence and job satisfaction. Specifically, the direct role of emotional intelligence on job satisfaction was found to be significant, with work interference with personal life (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.02, SE\u2009=\u2009.01, p\u2009=\u2009.001) and personal life interference with work (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.02, SE\u2009=\u2009.01, p\u2009=\u2009.002) showing significant indirect roles. Higher emotional intelligence was directly and significantly associated with more job satisfaction (p\u2009<\u2009.01).\nThe study underscores the potential benefits of emotional intelligence training and work-life balance promotion in enhancing nurses' job satisfaction.\nPending future longitudinal studies, findings cautiously imply that targeting work-life balance could help foster the positive connection between emotional intelligence and Job Satisfaction among nurses. Accordingly, healthcare administrators should prioritize policies that promote flexible scheduling, sufficient staffing levels, and mental health resources, which are essential for maintaining a balance between professional obligations Job Satisfaction and personal life.",

    "abstract": "GI (Gastrointestinal) malignancies are one of the most common and lethal cancers globally. The dawn of precision medicine and developing technologies have reduced the mortality rates for GI malignancies, underscoring the main role of early detection methods for survival rate improvement. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a new technology that may improve GI cancer screening, treatment, and therapeutic efficiency for better patient care. AI could accelerate the development of targeted therapies by analyzing considerable data from the genome and identifying biomarkers connected with GI tumors. This opens up new avenues toward more tailored and personalized approaches, raising efficacy while reducing undesired side effects. For instance, AI may improve treatment outcomes by accurately predicting patient responses to therapeutic regimens, helping oncologists choose the most effective treatment options. This review will outline the transformative potential of AI in GI oncology by emphasizing the incorporation of AI-based technologies to enhance patient care.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence broadly refers to computer systems that simulate intelligent behaviour with minimal human intervention. Emphasizing patient-centered care, research has explored patients' perspectives on artificial intelligence in medical care, indicating general acceptance of the technology but also concerns about supervision. However, these views have not been systematically examined from the perspective of patients with cancer, whose opinions may differ given the distinct psychosocial toll of the disease.\nThis protocol describes a scoping review aimed at summarizing the existing literature on the attitudes of patients with cancer toward the use of artificial intelligence in their medical care. The primary goal is to identify knowledge gaps and highlight opportunities for future research.\nThis scoping review protocol will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA-ScR). The electronic databases MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL will be searched for peer-reviewed primary research articles published in academic journals. We will have two independent reviewers screen the articles retrieved from the literature search and select relevant studies based on our inclusion criteria, with a third reviewer resolving any disagreements. We will then compile the data from the included articles into a narrative summary and discuss the implications for clinical practice and future research.\nTo our knowledge, this will be the first scoping review to map the existing literature on the attitudes of patients with cancer regarding artificial intelligence in their medical care.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the application of Artificial Intelligence and network science methodologies in characterizing interdisciplinary disciplines, with a specific focus on the field of Italian design, taken as a paradigmatic example. Exploratory data analysis and the study of academic collaboration networks highlight how the field is evolving towards increased collaboration. Text analysis and semantic topic modelling identified the evolution of research interest over time, defining a ranking of pairs of keywords and three prominent research topics: User-Centric Experience Design, Innovative Product Design and Sustainable Service Design. Our results revealed a significant transformation in the field, with a shift from individual to collaborative research, as evidenced by the increasing complexity and collaboration within groups. We acknowledge the limitations faced by this work, suggesting that the methodology may be primarily suitable for bibliometric and more silos-like disciplines. However, we emphasize the urgency for the scientific community to address the future of research not indexed by large open-access databases like OpenAlex.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the ability of human readers, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), and an online artificial intelligence (AI) detection tool (GPTZero) to distinguish between AI-generated and human-written personal statements in physical therapist education program applications.\nThe emergence of large language models such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini has raised concerns about the authenticity of personal statements. Previous studies have reported varying degrees of success in detecting AI-generated text.\nData were collected from 50 randomly selected nonmatriculated individuals who applied to the Mayo Clinic School of Health Sciences Doctor of Physical Therapy Program during the 2021-2022 application cycle.\nFifty personal statements from applicants were pooled with 50 Google Gemini-generated statements, then analyzed by 2 individuals, RQA, and GPTZero. RQA provided quantitative measures of lexical sophistication, whereas GPTZero used advanced machine learning algorithms to quantify AI-specific text characteristics.\nHuman raters demonstrated high agreement (\u03ba = 0.92) and accuracy (97% and 99%). RQA parameters, particularly recurrence and max line, differentiated human- from AI-generated statements (areas under receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve = 0.768 and 0.859, respectively). GPTZero parameters including simplicity, perplexity, and readability also differentiated human- from AI-generated statements (areas under ROC curve > 0.875).\nThe study reveals that human raters, RQA, and GPTZero offer varying levels of accuracy in differentiating human-written from AI-generated personal statements. The findings could have important implications in academic admissions processes, where distinguishing between human- and AI-generated submissions is becoming increasingly important. Future research should explore integrating these methods to enhance the robustness and reliability of personal statement content evaluation across various domains. Three strategies for managing AI's role in applications-for applicants, governing organizations, and academic institutions-are provided to promote integrity and accountability in admission processes.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to explore the validity and inter-device reliability of a novel artificial intelligence app (Asstrapp) for real-time measurement of the traditional (tra505) and modified-505 (mod505) change of direction (COD) tests. Twenty-five male Sports Science students (age, 23.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.27\u00a0years; body height, 178\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.76\u00a0cm; body mass, 79.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.7\u00a0kg) completed 12 trials each, consisting of six tra505 and six mod505 trials. Completion times were simultaneously recorded via single-beam electronic timing gates (ETG) and two different iPhones (APP1 and APP2). In total 300 trials were collected across the two tests, using all three devices, to establish the reliability and validity of the app. The coefficient of variation indicated a similar level of dispersion between the ETG (\u2264\u00a02.73%), APP1 (\u2264\u00a02.39%) and APP2 (\u2264\u00a02.52%). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) revealed excellent reliability among the three timing devices (ICC \u2265\u00a00.99) and Asstrapp relative reliability was excellent for both APP1 (ICC \u2265\u00a00.91) and APP2 (ICC \u2265\u00a00.91). There was a practically perfect correlation and agreement between ETG and Asstrapp (APP1: r\u00a0=\u00a00.97; APP2: r\u00a0=\u00a00.97) for both COD tests. However, small but significant differences were found between smartphones and ETG for tra505 (ES\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.33; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Collectively, these findings support the use of Asstrapp for real-time assessment of both 505 COD tests.",

    "abstract": "This original study aimed to examine the relationship of emotional intelligence and passion to decision-making\u00a0in surgical nurses.\nIt is a descriptive, relational study.\nThis study was conducted with 166 surgical nurses. Data for the study were collected using the Descriptive Characteristics Form, Passion Scale, Emotional Intelligence Scale, and Nurse Decision-Making Scale.\nThe decision-making level of 85.6% of the surgical nurses was found to be at the third level. There was a 0.265\u00a0U\u00a0increase in decision-making score for a 1\u00a0U increase in nursing experience. A 1\u00a0U increase in the standard deviation of the Emotional Intelligence Scale increased the standard deviation of the Nursing Decision-Making Scale by 0.322\u00a0U,\u00a0and a 1\u00a0U increase in the standard deviation of the Passion Scale increased the standard deviation of the Nursing Decision-Making Scale by 0.268\u00a0U.\nSurgical nurses' passion, emotional intelligence, and decision-making levels were found to be high. A positive relationship was also found between the passion and emotional intelligence levels of surgical nurses and their decision-making. Decision-making is crucial in nursing, particularly in the surgical setting where passion and emotional intelligence play a significant role. This study highlights how passion, associated with professional growth\u00a0and emotional intelligence and\u00a0empathy and situational awareness, influence surgical nurses' decision-making processes.",

    "abstract": "Integrating robots and artificial intelligence (AI) into workplaces is becoming increasingly prevalent across various sectors, including hospitality. This trend has raised concerns regarding employee anxiety and the potential for higher turnover intentions, particularly when AI technologies are perceived to undermine professional expertise. This study explores the relationship between awareness of robotics and AI and employee turnover intentions, framed within the Conservation of Resources Theory (COR). To address the challenges posed by AI in the workforce, hotel managers must prioritise organizational support in areas such as financial resources, policy development, career advancement, and employee adaptation. The hospitality industry is leveraging AI and robotics to enhance guest interactions and service delivery, yet this technological shift may inadvertently increase employees' intentions to leave their positions. Employing a cross-sectional design, we gathered data through a structured questionnaire utilizing a five-point Likert scale, targeting 435 employees from 5- and 7-star hotels in Lahore, Pakistan, including CEOs, managers, directors, supervisors, executives, and room service operators. Our findings reveal a significant positive relationship between awareness of robotics and AI and employee turnover intentions. Moreover, mutual trust (MT) emerged as a moderating factor positively affecting the association between robotics awareness and turnover intentions. While technical grooming (TG) and job insecurity (JI) were not previously discussed in the literature, our research indicates that they also play critical roles in this context, highlighting the complex interplay of factors influencing turnover intentions in the face of advancing technology.",

    "abstract": "Accurate classification of lymphadenopathy is essential for determining the pathological nature of lymph nodes (LNs), which plays a crucial role in treatment selection. The biopsy method is invasive and carries the risk of sampling failure, while the utilization of non-invasive approaches such as ultrasound can minimize the probability of iatrogenic injury and infection. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, the diagnostic efficiency of LNs is further enhanced. This study evaluates the performance of ultrasound-based AI applications in the classification of benign and malignant LNs.\nThe literature research was conducted using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases as of June 2024. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated to assess the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasound-based AI in classifying benign and malignant LNs. Subgroup analyses were also conducted to identify potential sources of heterogeneity.\nA total of 1,355 studies were identified and reviewed. Among these studies, 19 studies met the inclusion criteria, and 2,354 cases were included in the analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and DOR of ultrasound-based machine learning in classifying benign and malignant LNs were 0.836 (95% CI [0.805, 0.863]), 0.850 (95% CI [0.805, 0.886]), and 33.331 (95% CI [22.873, 48.57]), respectively, indicating no publication bias (p\u2009=\u20090.12). Subgroup analyses may suggest that the location of lymph nodes, validation methods, and type of primary tumor are the sources of heterogeneity.\nAI can accurately differentiate benign from malignant LNs. Given the widespread use of ultrasonography in diagnosing malignant LNs in cancer patients, there is significant potential for integrating AI-based decision support systems into clinical practice to enhance the diagnostic accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been growing more powerful and accessible, and will increasingly impact many areas, including virtually all aspects of medicine and biomedical research. This review focuses on previous, current, and especially emerging applications of AI in clinical genetics. Topics covered include a brief explanation of different general categories of AI, including machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI. After introductory explanations and examples, the review discusses AI in clinical genetics in three main categories: clinical diagnostics; management and therapeutics; clinical support. The review concludes with short, medium, and long-term predictions about the ways that AI may affect the field of clinical genetics. Overall, while the precise speed at which AI will continue to change clinical genetics is unclear, as are the overall ramifications for patients, families, clinicians, researchers, and others, it is likely that AI will result in dramatic evolution in clinical genetics. It will be important for all those involved in clinical genetics to prepare accordingly in order to minimize the risks and maximize benefits related to the use of AI in the field.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model for the screening of degenerative joint disease (DJD) using temporomandibular joint (TMJ) panoramic radiography and joint noise data. A total of 2631 TMJ panoramic images were collected, resulting in a final dataset of 3908 images (2127 normal (N) and 1781 DJD (D)) after excluding indeterminate cases and errors. AI models using GoogleNet were evaluated with six different combinations of image data, clinician-detected crepitus, and patient-reported joint noise. The model that integrated all joint noise data with imaging demonstrated the highest performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.72. Another model, which incorporated both imaging and crepitus, also achieved the same F1-score but had lower D recall (0.55 vs. 0.67) and N precision (0.71 vs. 0.74). The AI models outperformed orofacial pain specialists when provided with imaging alone or in combination with all joint noise data. These findings suggest that AI-enhanced DJD diagnosis using TMJ panoramic radiography and joint noise data offers a promising approach for early detection and improved patient care. The results underscore AI's capability to integrate diverse diagnostic factors, providing a comprehensive and accurate assessment that surpasses traditional methods.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) tools can triage radiology scans to streamline the patient pathway and also relieve clinician workload. Validated AI tools can mitigate the delays in reporting scans by flagging time-sensitive and actionable findings. In this study, we aim to investigate current stakeholder perspectives and identify obstacles to integrating AI in clinical pathways. We created a survey to ascertain the perspectives of 133 clinicians across the United Kingdom regarding the acceptability of an AI tool that triages MRI brain scans into 'normal' and 'abnormal'. As part of this survey, we supplied clinicians with information on training and validation case numbers, model performance, validation using unseen data, and explainability saliency maps. With regards to the specific use case of AI in MRI brain scans, 71% of respondents preferred the use of an AI-assisted triage compared to the current system without triage, typically chronologically. Notably, information that explained and helped visualise the AI model's decision making was found to improve clinician confidence. When shown a heatmap, 60% of participants felt more confident in the AI's decision. The results of this short communication demonstrate a positive support for the implementation of AI-assistive tools in triage.",

    "abstract": "Eutrophication is one of the most relevant concerns due to the risk to water supply and food security. Nitrogen and phosphorus chemical species concentrations determined the risk and magnitude of eutrophication. These analyses are even more relevant in basins with intensive agriculture due to agrochemical discharges. However, analyzing these nutrients is labor intensive, as sampling to intercalibration in the laboratory requires considerable financial and human resources. Currently, artificial intelligence allows the modeling of phenomena and variables in various fields. This research focuses on the exploration of other machine learning methods, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and random forest (RF) for the estimation of nutrients in surface waters of Sinaloa, Mexico (11 model basins), the states with the highest exports of agricultural products. Nutrients were considered in all possible chemical forms, such as total nitrogen, Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus, and orthophosphate. For estimation, the selected input parameters are characterized by pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, water temperature, and total suspended solids, which do not require chemical reagents and can be measured in real time. The parameter information was obtained from the National Network for Water Quality Monitoring database (6,200 data recorded since 2012). Finally, hyperparameter normalization and optimization (HPO) methods were implemented to maximize the best-performing model. Each model obtained different coefficient of determination values (R2): MLP between 0.64 and 0.77, CNN from 0.65 to 0.76, KNN from 0.64 to 0.79, and RF from 0.79 to 0.85. The latter is considered the best performer, with values of 0.95 in training and 0.94 in validation after applying HPO. Notably, the models are valid for any surface water body and in any climatic season in the state of Sinaloa, M\u00e9xico. Therefore decision-makers can use them for science-based environmental regulation of land use and pesticide application.",

    "abstract": "Human cognitive abilities exhibit positive interrelationships that can be represented by a latent general intelligence factor (g). Differentiation hypotheses propose that there are systematic interindividual differences in the strength of g, specifically along the dimensions of ability level (ability differentiation) and age (age differentiation). Despite the potential implications for cognitive theory and assessment, the available evidence on the matter is inconclusive. We present comprehensive analyses of differentiation effects across the lifespan, drawing on the meta-analytic integration of nonlinear factor analyses with German standardization samples (",

    "abstract": "Current heart failure (HF) risk stratification strategies require comprehensive clinical evaluation. In this study, artificial intelligence (AI) applied to electrocardiogram (ECG) images was examined as a strategy to predict HF risk.\nAcross multinational cohorts in the Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS), UK Biobank (UKB), and Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil), individuals without baseline HF were followed for the first HF hospitalization. An AI-ECG model that defines cross-sectional left ventricular systolic dysfunction from 12-lead ECG images was used, and its association with incident HF was evaluated. Discrimination was assessed using Harrell's C-statistic. Pooled cohort equations to prevent HF (PCP-HF) were used as a comparator.\nAmong 231 285 YNHHS patients, 4472 had primary HF hospitalizations over 4.5 years (inter-quartile range 2.5-6.6). In UKB and ELSA-Brasil, among 42 141 and 13 454 people, 46 and 31 developed HF over 3.1 (2.1-4.5) and 4.2 (3.7-4.5) years. A positive AI-ECG screen portended a 4- to 24-fold higher risk of new-onset HF [age-, sex-adjusted hazard ratio: YNHHS, 3.88 (95% confidence interval 3.63-4.14); UKB, 12.85 (6.87-24.02); ELSA-Brasil, 23.50 (11.09-49.81)]. The association was consistent after accounting for comorbidities and the competing risk of death. Higher probabilities were associated with progressively higher HF risk. Model discrimination was 0.718 in YNHHS, 0.769 in UKB, and 0.810 in ELSA-Brasil. In YNHHS and ELSA-Brasil, incorporating AI-ECG with PCP-HF yielded a significant improvement in discrimination over PCP-HF alone.\nAn AI model applied to a single ECG image defined the risk of future HF, representing a digital biomarker for stratifying HF risk.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered platforms may be used to ensure that clinically significant lung nodules receive appropriate management. We studied the impact of a commercially available AI natural language processing tool on detection of clinically significant indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) based on radiology reports and provision of guideline-consistent care.\nAll computed tomography (CT) scans performed at a single tertiary care center in the outpatient or emergency room setting between 20-Feb-2024 and 20-March-2024 were processed by the AI natural language processing algorithm. CT radiology reports mentioning a lung nodule or focal indeterminate lesion were flagged. All flagged reports were reviewed by a lung nodule expert two weeks after nodule identification. IPNs were classified as \"appropriately followed\" if follow-up imaging, referral to a nodule clinic, or other guideline-consistent care was ordered. IPNs were classified as \"not appropriately followed\" if no acknowledgement of the reported nodule was documented in the electronic health record within two weeks of being flagged.\nThe AI software processed 76,507 unique radiology reports, identified 2,585 CT scans with chest imaging, and found 389 IPNs. Review determined that 272 (70%) nodules were appropriately followed while 117 (30%) were not appropriately followed. Of the 117 nodules without documented follow-up, 67 (57%) were > 8mm and 24 (20.5%) were > 15mm. IPNs that would not have received follow-up in the absence of the AI software generated 43 additional clinical appointments and 3 procedures.\nAt a large tertiary care center, 30% of clinically significant incidental pulmonary nodules that would have otherwise been missed were brought to the attention of lung nodule clinicians by an AI software, allowing for initiation of appropriate follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to shape the future of medical practice. The perspective and understanding of medical students are critical for guiding the development of educational curricula and training.\nThis study aims to assess and compare medical AI-related attitudes among medical students in general medicine and in one of the visually oriented fields (pathology), along with illuminating their anticipated role of AI in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-enhanced health care.\nThis was a cross-sectional study that used a web-based survey composed of a closed-ended questionnaire. The survey addressed medical students at all educational levels across the 5 public medical schools, along with pathology residents in 4 residency programs in Jordan.\nA total of 394 respondents participated (328 medical students and 66 pathology residents). The majority of respondents (272/394, 69%) were already aware of AI and deep learning in medicine, mainly relying on websites for information on AI, while only 14% (56/394) were aware of AI through medical schools. There was a statistically significant difference in awareness among respondents who consider themselves tech experts compared with those who do not (P=.03). More than half of the respondents believed that AI could be used to diagnose diseases automatically (213/394, 54.1% agreement), with medical students agreeing more than pathology residents (P=.04). However, more than one-third expressed fear about recent AI developments (167/394, 42.4% agreed). Two-thirds of respondents disagreed that their medical schools had educated them about AI and its potential use (261/394, 66.2% disagreed), while 46.2% (182/394) expressed interest in learning about AI in medicine. In terms of pathology-specific questions, 75.4% (297/394) agreed that AI could be used to identify pathologies in slide examinations automatically. There was a significant difference between medical students and pathology residents in their agreement (P=.001). Overall, medical students and pathology trainees had similar responses.\nAI education should be introduced into medical school curricula to improve medical students' understanding and attitudes. Students agreed that they need to learn about AI's applications, potential hazards, and legal and ethical implications. This is the first study to analyze medical students' views and awareness of AI in Jordan, as well as the first to include pathology residents' perspectives. The findings are consistent with earlier research internationally. In comparison with prior research, these attitudes are similar in low-income and industrialized countries, highlighting the need for a global strategy to introduce AI instruction to medical students everywhere in this era of rapidly expanding technology.",

The majority of respondents (272/394, 69%) were already aware of AI and deep learning in medicine, mainly relying on websites for information on AI, while only 14% (56/394) were aware of AI through medical schools. There was a statistically significant difference in awareness among respondents who consider themselves tech experts compared with those who do not (P=.03). More than half of the respondents believed that AI could be used to diagnose diseases automatically (213/394, 54.1% agreement), with medical students agreeing more than pathology residents (P=.04). However, more than one-third expressed fear about recent AI developments (167/394, 42.4% agreed). Two-thirds of respondents disagreed that their medical schools had educated them about AI and its potential use (261/394, 66.2% disagreed), while 46.2% (182/394) expressed interest in learning about AI in medicine. In terms of pathology-specific questions, 75.4% (297/394) agreed that AI could be used to identify pathologies in slide examinations automatically. There was a significant difference between medical students and pathology residents in their agreement (P=.001). Overall, medical students and pathology trainees had similar responses.",

    "abstract": "Problem-solving skills are some of the leading strategies for dynamism in the content and quality of nursing care.\nThe present study is aimed at determining nursing students' problem-solving, solution-focused thinking, and emotional intelligence levels and investigating the relationship between their problem-solving skills and these variables.\nThe study comprised 305 nursing students in Turkey. Data were collected between May and June 2021, using the personal information form, problem-solving inventory, solution-focused inventory and Schutte emotional intelligence scale. One-way ANOVA, t-test and multiple regression were used for data analysis.\nThe mean age of the participants was 21.81\u2009\u00b1\u20095.93 years, 75.7% of them were women, 35.1% were senior students and 58.0% perceived their academic achievement as moderate. The mean scores from the overall problem-solving inventory, solution-focused inventory, and emotional intelligence scale were 92.93\u2009\u00b1\u200919.30, 50.26\u2009\u00b1\u20098.43 and 128.22\u2009\u00b1\u200914.11, respectively. Variables such as sex, perceived academic achievement, emotional intelligence and solution-focused thinking levels affected problem-solving skills (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The effective predictive factors accounted for 50.2% of the change in participants' problem-solving skill levels.\nFor this reason, revising the national nursing curriculum with programmes that develop emotional intelligence and solution-focused thinking skills will enable nursing students to better manage the nursing process in clinical and field practices.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in many medical specialties. However, nephrology has lagged in adopting and incorporating machine learning techniques. Nephrology is well positioned to capitalize on the benefits of AI. The abundance of structured clinical data, combined with the mathematical nature of this specialty, makes it an attractive option for AI applications. AI can also play a significant role in addressing health inequities, especially in organ transplantation. It has also been used to detect rare diseases such as Fabry disease early. This review article aims to increase awareness on the basic concepts in machine learning and discuss AI applications in nephrology. It also addresses the challenges in integrating AI into clinical practice and the need for creating an AI-competent nephrology workforce. Even though AI will not replace nephrologists, those who are able to incorporate AI into their practice effectively will undoubtedly provide better care to their patients. The integration of AI technology is no longer just an option but a necessity for staying ahead in the field of nephrology. Finally, AI can contribute as a force multiplier in transitioning to a value-based care model.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare are growing exponentially. The field of neurosurgery is particularly suited to implement AI solutions given its technology-driven nature. It is of paramount importance to understand the basics of AI to make informed decision on how to shape current and future applications.\nWhat is the level of confidence, knowledge and the attitude of the global neurosurgical community towards AI basic concepts and applications?\nA 24-item survey was designed and distributed. The survey results reported on level of knowledge, confidence and interest in AI, perspectives and attitude towards the application of AI technologies in neurosurgery. The potential influence of demographics and work-related environment features on AI knowledge was investigated.\nWe received a total of 250 responses from 61 countries. The correct definition of 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning' and main Big Data features were identified by respectively 42%, 23% and 23% of the respondents. The survey unveiled a strong interest and a positive attitude towards the introduction of AI in the neurosurgical practice. The main concerns included trustworthiness and liability, the main barriers to implementation were considered lack of funding, infrastructure, knowledge and multidisciplinary collaboration.\nThere is a low familiarity with basic AI concepts in the neurosurgical community. Nevertheless, there is a strong interest and a positive attitude towards AI implementation. The systematization of training and the production of educational resources will be key in guaranteeing a successful implementation of AI in the evolving history of neurosurgery.",

    "abstract": "It is being increasingly recognized that the strategic use of artificial intelligence (AI) can catalyze the process of manuscript writing. However, it is imperative that we recognize the hidden biases, pitfalls, and disadvantages of relying solely on AI, such as accuracy concerns and the potential erosion of nuanced human insight. With an emphasis on crafting effective prompts and inputs, this article reveals how to navigate the labyrinth of AI capabilities to create a good-quality manuscript. It also addresses the evolving guidelines from various publishers, shedding light on how to \"leverage the digital genie\" responsibly and ethically. We further explore how and which AI tools can be harnessed for literature reviews, executing statistical analyses, and polishing the language of the manuscript. Providing practical strategies for maximizing AI's benefits, this article underscores the indispensable value of human creativity and critical thinking, stressing that while AI can \"streamline the mundane,\" the author's insight remains vital for profound intellectual contributions.",

    "abstract": "A novel ring-gantry cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging system shows improved image quality compared to its conventional version, but its effect on autosegmentation is unknown. This study evaluates the impact of this high-performance CBCT on autosegmentation performance, inter-observer variability, contour correction times and delineation confidence, compared to the conventional CBCT.\nTwenty prostate cancer patients were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. Per patient, one pair of high-performance CBCT and conventional CBCT scans was included. Three observers manually corrected contours generated by the artificial intelligence (AI) model for prostate, seminal vesicles, bladder, rectum and bowel. Differences between AI-based and manual corrected contours were quantified using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile of Hausdorff distance (HD95). Autosegmentation performance and interobserver variation were compared using a random effects model; correction times and confidence scores using a paired \nAutosegmentation performance showed small, but statistically insignificant differences. Interobserver variability, assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient, was significantly different across most organs, but these were considered clinically irrelevant (maximum difference\u00a0=\u00a00.08). Mean contour correction times were similar for both CBCT systems (11:03 versus 11:12\u00a0min; p\u00a0=\u00a00.66). Delineation confidence scores were significantly higher with the high-performance CBCT scans for prostate, seminal vesicles and rectum (4.5 versus 3.5, 4.3 versus 3.5, 4.8 versus 4.3; all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nThe high-performance CBCT did not (clinically) improve autosegmentation performance, inter-observer variability or contour correction time compared to conventional CBCT. However, it clearly enhanced user confidence in organ delineation for prostate, seminal vesicles and rectum.",

    "abstract": "Drugs that interact with multiple therapeutic targets are potential high-value products in polypharmacology-based drug discovery, but the rational design remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to design the chemical structures of compounds that interact with multiple therapeutic target proteins. The molecular structure generation is performed by a fragment-based approach using a genetic algorithm with chemical substructures and a deep learning approach using reinforcement learning with stochastic policy gradients in the framework of generative adversarial networks. Using the proposed methods, we designed the chemical structures of compounds that would interact with two therapeutic targets of bronchial asthma, i.e., adenosine A2a receptor (ADORA2A) and phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D). We then synthesized 10 compounds and evaluated their\u00a0bioactivities via the binding assays of 39 target human proteins, including ADORA2A and PDE4D. Three of the 10 synthesized compounds successfully interacted with ADORA2A and PDE4D with high specificity.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing medical writing by enhancing the efficiency and precision of healthcare communication and health research. This review explores the transformative integration of AI in medical writing, highlighting its dual role of enhancing efficiency while maintaining the crucial elements of human expertise. AI technologies, including natural language processing and AI-driven literature review tools, have significantly advanced, facilitating rapid draft generation, literature summarization, and consistency in medical documentation. Key applications include aiding study design, enhancing content drafting, and optimizing literature reviews through specific AI tools. Moreover, this review delves into practical applications of AI in the context of lower extremity wounds, specifically ischemic leg ulcers, demonstrating how AI can streamline the synthesis of relevant literature. While AI presents notable advantages, it also raises ethical concerns, such as potential biases and data privacy issues, highlighting the need for human oversight in the writing process. A proposed future framework suggests that AI could take over routine tasks, allowing medical writers to devote more attention to analytical and ethical aspects. Additionally, there is a strong need for further research on the cost-effectiveness of both clinical trials utilizing AI interventions and the incorporation of AI in medical writing. Ultimately, balancing the integration of AI in medical writing promises to improve both healthcare communication and health research, ensuring the production of high-quality, patient-centric and research-focused content.",

    "abstract": "Single-subject voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a powerful technique for reader-independent detection of brain atrophy in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to support the (differential) diagnosis and staging of neurodegenerative diseases in individual patients. However, VBM is sensitive to the MRI scanner platform and details of the acquisition sequence. To mitigate this limitation, we recently proposed and \nClinical validation of CNN-based VBM.\nCNN-based VBM was compared with conventional VBM based on a mixed-scanner normative database in 227 consecutive patients (66.0\u2009\u00b1\u20099.6 years, 53.3% female) with suspected dementing neurodegenerative disease. VBM maps were interpreted visually by two experienced readers, first with respect to the presence of any neurodegenerative disease, then for the differentiation between Alzheimer's disease (AD)-typical and non-AD atrophy patterns. A Likert 6-score was used for both tasks. Simultaneously acquired positron emission tomography (PET) with \nRepeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant impact of the VBM method on the visual detection of any neurodegenerative disease (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Balanced accuracy/sensitivity/specificity were 80.4/86.3/74.5% for CNN-based VBM versus 75.7/79.5/71.8% for conventional VBM. Differentiation between AD and non-AD typical atrophy patterns did not differ between both VBM methods (p\u2009=\u20090.871).\nCNN-based VBM provides clinically useful accuracy for the detection of neurodegeneration-suspect atrophy with higher sensitivity than conventional VBM with a mixed-scanner normative reference database and without compromising specificity.",

    "abstract": "Pre-injury frailty has been investigated as a tool to predict outcomes of older trauma patients. Using artificial intelligence principles of machine learning, we aimed to identify a \"signature\" (combination of clinical variables) that could predict which older adults are at risk of fall-related hospital admission. We hypothesized that frailty, measured using the 5-item modified Frailty Index, could be utilized in combination with other factors as a predictor of admission for fall-related injuries.\nThe National Readmission Database was mined to identify factors associated with admission of older adults for fall-related injuries. Older adults admitted for trauma-related injuries from 2010 to 2014 were included. Age, sex, number of chronic conditions and past fall-related admission, comorbidities, 5-item modified Frailty Index, and medical insurance status were included in the analysis. Two machine learning models were selected among six tested models (logistic regression and random forest). Using a decision tree as a surrogate model for random forest, we extracted high-risk combinations of factors associated with admission for fall-related injury.\nOur approach yielded 18 models. Being a woman was one of the factors most often associated with admission for fall-related injuries. Frailty appeared in four of the 18 combinations. Being a woman, aged 65-74\u2009years and presenting a 5-item modified Frailty Index score >3 predicted admission for fall-related injuries in 80.3% of this population.\nUsing artificial intelligence principles of machine learning, we were able to develop 18 signatures allowing us to identify older adults at risk of admission for fall-related injuries. Future studies using other databases, such as TQIP, are warranted to validate our high-risk combination models. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2025; \u2022\u2022: \u2022\u2022-\u2022\u2022.",

    "abstract": "Systematic review.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) models have recently emerged as tools to improve fracture detection, mainly through imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and radiographs. This systematic review evaluates the diagnostic performance of AI and DL models in detecting cervical spine fractures and assesses their potential role in clinical practice.\nA systematic search of PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted for studies published between January 2000 and July 2024. Studies that evaluated AI models for cervical spine fracture detection were included. Diagnostic performance metrics were extracted and included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve. The PROBAST tool assessed bias, and PRISMA criteria were used for study selection and reporting.\nEleven studies published between 2021 and 2024 were included in the review. AI models demonstrated variable performance, with sensitivity ranging from 54.9% to 100% and specificity from 72% to 98.6%. Models applied to CT imaging generally outperformed those applied to radiographs, with convolutional neural networks (CNN) and advanced architectures such as MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformer (ViT) achieving the highest accuracy. However, most studies lacked external validation, raising concerns about the generalizability of their findings.\nAI and DL models show significant potential in improving fracture detection, particularly in CT imaging. While these models offer high diagnostic accuracy, further validation and refinement are necessary before they can be widely integrated into clinical practice. AI should complement, rather than replace, human expertise in diagnostic workflows.",

    "abstract": "Investigators conducting clinical trials have an ethical, scientific, and regulatory obligation to protect the safety of trial participants. Traditionally, safety monitoring includes manual review and coding of adverse event data by expert clinicians.\nOur study explores the use of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to streamline and standardize clinician coding of adverse event data in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials.\nOur quantitative retrospective study aimed to develop a gold standard AD adverse event data set, evaluate the predictive performance of NLP-based models to classify adverse events, and determine whether automated coding is more efficient, accurate, reliable, and consistent than clinician coding.\nOur study was conducted at the University of Southern California's Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute (ATRI). ATRI serves as the clinical and data coordinating center for the Alzheimer's Clinical Trial Consortium (ACTC).\nWe collected demographic and adverse event data from eight completed clinical trials in participants (n=1920) with symptomatic AD conducted between 2005 and 2020.\nOriginal expert clinician-confirmed codes were used for all model performance comparisons. F1 score was used as the primary model selection metric. Final classifier performance was evaluated using predictive accuracy. Clinician effort was measured in time to code, review, and confirm coded adverse events.\nIn a sample of 1000 adverse events, AI-based AE coding achieved higher accuracy (\u223c20% increase in accuracy) and was more cost-effective (\u223c80% cost reduction) than traditional clinician coding.\nOur study results demonstrate how approaches that effectively combine AI and human expertise can improve the efficiency and quality of adverse event coding and clinical trial safety monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Visual assessment of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is time-consuming, influenced by reader experience and prone to interobserver variability. This study evaluated a novel algorithm for coronary stenosis quantification (atherosclerosis imaging quantitative CT, AI-QCT).\nThe study included 208 patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing CCTA in Perfusion Imaging and CT Coronary Angiography With Invasive Coronary Angiography-1. AI-QCT and blinded readers assessed coronary artery stenosis following the Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System consensus. Accuracy of AI-QCT was compared with a level 3 and two level 2 clinical readers against an invasive quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) reference standard (\u226550% stenosis) in an area under the curve (AUC) analysis, evaluated per-patient and per-vessel and stratified by plaque volume.\nAmong 208 patients with a mean age of 58\u00b19 years and 37% women, AI-QCT demonstrated superior concordance with QCA compared with clinical CCTA assessments. For the detection of obstructive stenosis (\u226550%), AI-QCT achieved an AUC of 0.91 on a per-patient level, outperforming level 3 (AUC 0.77; p<0.002) and level 2 readers (AUC 0.79; p<0.001 and AUC 0.76; p<0.001). The advantage of AI-QCT was most prominent in those with above median plaque volume. At the per-vessel level, AI-QCT achieved an AUC of 0.86, similar to level 3 (AUC 0.82; p=0.098) stenosis, but superior to level 2 readers (both AUC 0.69; p<0.001).\nAI-QCT demonstrated superior agreement with invasive QCA compared to clinical CCTA assessments, particularly compared to level 2 readers in those with extensive CAD. Integrating AI-QCT into routine clinical practice holds promise for improving the accuracy of stenosis quantification through CCTA.",

    "abstract": "Although smartphone-based devices have been developed to record 1-lead ECG, existing solutions for automatic atrial fibrillation (AF) detection often has poor positive predictive value.\nThis study aimed to validate a cloud-based deep learning platform for automatic AF detection in a large cohort of patients using 1-lead ECG records.\nWe analyzed 8,528 patients with 30-second ECG records from a single-lead handheld ECG device. Ground truth for AF presence was established through a benchmark algorithm and expert manual labeling. The Willem Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform, not trained on these ECGs, was used for automatic arrhythmia detection, including AF. A rules-based algorithm was also used for comparison. An expert cardiology committee reviewed false positives and negatives and performance metrics were computed.\nThe AI platform achieved an accuracy of 96.1% (initial labels) and 96.4% (expert review), with sensitivities of 83.3% and 84.2%, and specificities of 97.3% and 97.6%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 75.2% and 78.0%, and the negative predictive value was 98.4%. Performance of the AI platform largely exceeded the performance of the rules-based algorithm for all metrics. The AI also detected other arrhythmias, such as premature ventricular complexes, premature atrial complexes along with 1-degree atrioventricular blocks.\nThe result of this external validation indicates that the AI platform can match cardiologist-level accuracy in AF detection from 1-lead ECGs. Such tools are promising for AF screening and has the potential to improve accuracy in non-cardiology expert healthcare professional interpretation and trigger further tests for effective patient management.",

    "abstract": "Surveys to assess views about artificial intelligence (AI) of various diagnostic radiology constituencies have revealed interesting combinations of enthusiasm, caution, and implementation priorities. We surveyed academic radiology leaders about their views on AI and how they intend to approach AI implementation in their departments.\nWe conducted a web survey of Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments (SCARD) members between October 5 and October 31, 2023 to solicit optimism or pessimism about AI, target use cases, planned implementation, and perceptions of their workforce. P-values are provided only for descriptive purposes and have not been adjusted for multiple testing in this exploratory research.\nThe survey was sent to the 112 SCARD members and 43 responded (38%). Chairs were optimistic, with no statistical difference between views of AI in general versus generative AI. Chairs plan to implement AI to improve quality and efficiency (43/43, 100%), burnout (41/43, 95%), healthcare costs (22/43, 51%), and equity (27/43, 63%) and most likely will target the post-processing (26/43, 60%), interpretation workflow (26/43, 60%), and image acquisition (18/43, 42%) steps in the imaging value chain. Chairs perceived that radiologists (36/43, 84%) and technologists (38/43, 88%) were not particularly worried about being displaced but saw trainees as slightly less confident (31/43, 72%). Free text responses revealed concerns about the cost of AI and emphasized trade-offs that needed to be balanced.\nRadiology Chairs are optimistic about AI and poised to tackle departmental challenges. Concerns about generative AI and workforce replacement are minimal.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in emergency medicine, focusing on its utility in triaging and managing acute gynecologic and obstetric emergencies.\nThis feasibility study assessed Chat-GPT's performance in triaging and recommending management interventions for gynecologic and obstetric emergencies, using ten fictive cases. Five common conditions were modeled for each specialty. Chat-GPT was tasked with proposing triage classifications and providing immediate management recommendations. Human experts independently reviewed each case, classified triage categories, and proposed management. Following this, experts evaluated Chat-GPT's recommendations, rating the AI's responses on accuracy and clinical applicability.\nChat-GPT's recommendations demonstrated high concordance with human evaluators. Chat-GPT's triage classifications matched those of human experts in most cases, though minor discrepancies in urgency ratings were observed. The A\u00cds suggestions were mostly rated as \"very good\" to \"excellent.\" While Chat-GPT consistently delivered appropriate responses, some human evaluators noted slight differences in perceived urgency.\nThis study highlights Chat-GPT's potential as a clinical support tool in emergency medicine. Chat-GPT provided structured, evidence-based recommendations comparable to those of experienced clinicians, especially for high-stakes gynecologic and obstetric emergencies. Although encouraging, these results highlight the value of utilizing AI in addition to human knowledge, as variations in urgency ratings and management nuances highlight the necessity of human supervision in crucial decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Transformative change is needed across the food system to improve health and environmental outcomes. As food, nutrition, environmental and health data are generated beyond human scale, there is an opportunity for technological tools to support multifactorial, integrated, scalable approaches to address the complexities of dietary behaviour change. Responsible technology could act as a mechanistic conduit between research, policy, industry and society, enabling timely, informed decision making and action by all stakeholders across the food system. Domain expertise in food, nutrition and health should always be integrated into both the development and continuous deployment of AI-powered nutritional intelligence (NI) to ensure it is responsible, accurate, safe, useable and effective. Dietary behaviours are complex and improving diet-related health outcomes requires socio-cultural-demographic considerations within the design and deployment of NI tools. This article describes existing examples of NI within the food system and future opportunities. Human-in-the-loop approaches with food, health and nutrition experts involved at all stages including data acquisition, processing, output validation and ongoing quality assurance are essential to ensure evidence-based practice. The same ethical considerations should apply in this domain as in any other (e.g. privacy, inclusivity, robustness, transparency and accountability) and responsible practice must encompass rigorous standards and alignment with regulatory frameworks. Critical today and in the future is accessibility to appropriate high-quality food compositional data sets, which include up-to-date information on commercially available products that reflect the constantly evolving food landscape to realise the potential of responsible AI to help address the existing food system challenges.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in healthcare is revolutionizing the workflows of healthcare professionals, enabling faster and more accurate patient treatment. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of responses provided by different AI chatbots to questions that dentists might ask regarding regenerative endodontic treatment (RET), a procedure that shows promising biological healing potential.\nA total of 23 questions related to RET procedures were developed based on the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) 2022 guidelines. These questions were presented to three platforms: Google Bard (Gemini), ChatGPT-4o, and ChatGPT-4 with a PDF plugin. The questions were asked three times a day over the course of 10 days by two different researchers. The responses obtained were categorized as correct, incorrect, or insufficient according to the guidelines, and the results were statistically analyzed.\nA total of 1,380 responses were collected from the three platforms. Statistical analysis revealed significant relationships between the responses given by the platforms during morning, noon, and evening sessions (p\u2009<\u20090.05). ChatGPT-4 with the PDF plugin had the highest correct response rate (98.1%), while Gemini depicted the lowest (48%).\nWhile ChatGPT-4o and Gemini offer promising results for regenerative endodontic clinical applications, they do not provide sufficient guidance. However, ChatGPT-4 with the PDF plugin could be a valuable tool for clinicians due to its high accuracy rate. Further research is needed to develop AI programs specifically designed for clinicians in the field of endodontics.",

    "abstract": "Skin diseases impact millions of people around the world and pose a severe risk to public health. These diseases have a wide range of effects on the skin's structure, functionality, and appearance. Identifying and predicting skin diseases are laborious processes that require a complete physical examination, a review of the patient's medical history, and proper laboratory diagnostic testing. Additionally, it necessitates a significant number of histological and clinical characteristics for examination and subsequent treatment. As a disease's complexity and quantity of features grow, identifying and predicting it becomes more challenging. This research proposes a deep learning (DL) model utilizing transfer learning (TL) to quickly identify skin diseases like chickenpox, measles, and monkeypox. A pre-trained VGG16 is used for transfer learning. The VGG16 can identify and predict diseases more quickly by learning symptom patterns. Images of the skin from the four classes of chickenpox, measles, monkeypox, and normal are included in the dataset. The dataset is separated into training and testing. The experimental results performed on the dataset demonstrate that the VGG16 model can identify and predict skin diseases with 93.29% testing accuracy. However, the VGG16 model does not explain why and how the system operates because deep learning models are black boxes. Deep learning models' opacity stands in the way of their widespread application in the healthcare sector. In order to make this a valuable system for the health sector, this article employs layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to determine the relevance scores of each input. The identified symptoms provide valuable insights that could support timely diagnosis and treatment decisions for skin diseases.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into dental imaging has led to significant advancements, particularly in the analysis of panoramic radiographs, also known as orthopantomograms (OPGs). One emerging application of AI is in determining gender from these radiographs, a task traditionally performed by forensic experts using manual methods. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the accuracy of AI algorithms in gender determination using OPGs, focusing on the reliability and potential clinical and forensic applications of these technologies. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. The study included research articles that utilised AI algorithms for gender detection based on OPG images. Five major databases were searched, and studies were selected based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The analysis focused on studies that reported accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of AI models. Statistical analyses were performed using R software, including forest plots and funnel plots, to evaluate the diagnostic performance and potential publication bias. The meta-analysis included 13 studies, yielding a pooled accuracy estimate of 88.66%. The results demonstrated high specificity among the AI models, with some studies achieving accuracy rates as high as 99.20%. However, there was variability in sensitivity across different studies, indicating that some models are more reliable than others depending on the dataset and features used. The funnel plot analysis suggested slight asymmetry, indicating potential publication bias or heterogeneity. AI models show significant potential in accurately determining gender from OPG images, with some models achieving near-perfect accuracy. Continued research is needed to enhance model consistency and expand the applicability of these tools across different demographic groups.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing our ability to identify and interpret genetic variants associated with coagulation factor deficiencies. This review introduces AI, with a specific focus on machine learning (ML) methods, and examines its applications in the field of coagulation genetics over the past decade. We observed a significant increase in AI-related publications, with a focus on hemophilia A and B. ML approaches have shown promise in predicting the functional impact of genetic variants and establishing genotype-phenotype correlations, exemplified by tools like \"Hema-Class\" for FVIII variants. However, some challenges remain, including the need to expand variant selection beyond missense mutations (which is now the standard of most studies). For the future, the integration of AI in calling, detecting, and interpreting genetic variants can significantly improve our ability to process large-scale genomic data. In this frame, we discuss various AI/ML-based tools for genetic variant detection and interpretation, highlighting their strengths and limitations. As the field evolves, the synergistic application of multiple AI models, coupled with rigorous validation strategies, will be crucial in advancing our understanding of coagulation disorders and for personalizing treatment approaches.",

Once LVH is diagnosed, defining its cause has crucial clinical implications. Artificial intelligence (AI) may allow significant progress in the automated detection of LVH and its underlying causes from cardiovascular imaging. This systematic review aims to investigate the diagnostic performance of AI models developed to diagnose LVH and its common aetiologies.\nMEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies on echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and cardiac computed tomography (CT).\nThirty studies were included in this review. Of them, 14 were on echocardiography, 15 on CMR, and one on cardiac CT. Regarding the AI methods applied, 79\u00a0% of studies in echocardiography utilized deep learning (DL), 64\u00a0% employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and 21\u00a0% applied traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms. For CMR studies, 53\u00a0% used DL, 27\u00a0% relied on CNNs, and 47\u00a0% adopted traditional ML methods. All studies showed good diagnostic performances, but those applying AI tools to determine the underlying causes of LVH demonstrated the highest accuracy metrics compared to those focused on detecting LVH itself.\nAI models designed to detect and differentiate LVH on cardiac imaging are currently under development and are demonstrating promising results. Further studies focusing on real-life validation of these models, and cost-effectiveness analyses are needed.",

    "abstract": "Tiny machine learning (TinyML) and edge intelligence have emerged as pivotal paradigms for enabling machine learning on resource-constrained devices situated at the extreme edge of networks. In this paper, we explore the transformative potential of TinyML in facilitating pervasive, low-power cardiovascular monitoring and real-time analytics for patients with cardiac anomalies, leveraging wearable devices as the primary interface. To begin with, we provide an overview of TinyML software and hardware enablers, accompanied by an examination of networking solutions such as Low-power Wide area network (LPWAN) that facilitate the seamless deployment of TinyML frameworks. Following this, we delve into the methodologies of knowledge distillation, quantization, and pruning, which represent the cornerstone strategies for optimizing machine learning models to operate efficiently within resource-constrained environments. Furthermore, our discussion extends to the role of efficient deep neural networks tailored specifically for cardiovascular monitoring on wearable devices with limited computational resources. Through a comprehensive review, we analyze the applications of prominent artificial neural network architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Autoencoders, Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), and Transformers in the domain of Electrocardiogram (ECG) analytics, shedding light on their efficacy and potential in advancing healthcare technology.",

The aim of this research was to explore the perceptions of Lebanese health sciences students regarding the use of generative AI in higher education. A qualitative descriptive research design informed by descriptive phenomenology was employed. Semi-structured interviews were carried out among 23 health sciences students at one major private university in Beirut. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted over the period of 3\u2009months. The inductive thematic analysis generated two themes, and eight subthemes highlighting the benefits and concerns in using AI; customized, self-paced, and autonomous learning, improved language and writing skills, development of innovative concepts, enhanced efficiency, accuracy of information, overreliance on AI, equitable access, unclear policies. Results from this study emphasized the importance of combined efforts across sectors to close access gaps, encourage inclusiveness, and develop well framed policies that enable students to utilize these new technologies for their maximum benefits.",

    "abstract": "Determining the values of various properties for new bio-inks for 3D printing is a very important task in the design of new materials. For this purpose, a large number of experimental works have been consulted, and a database with more than 1200 bioprinting tests has been created. These tests cover different combinations of conditions in terms of print pressure, temperature, and needle values, for example. These data are difficult to deal with in terms of determining combinations of conditions to optimize the tests and analyze new options. The best model demonstrated a specificity (Sp) of 88.4% and a sensitivity (Sn) of 86.2% in the training series while achieving an Sp of 85.9% and an Sn of 80.3% in the external validation series. This model utilizes operators based on perturbation theory to analyze the complexity of the data. For comparative purposes, neural networks have been used, and very similar results have been obtained. The developed tool could easily be applied to predict the properties of bioprinting assays in silico. These findings could significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of predictive models in bioprinting without resorting to trial-and-error tests, thereby saving time and funds. Ultimately, this tool may help pave the way for advances in personalized medicine and tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "This narrative review explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into nursing informatics\u00a0and examines its impact on nursing practice, healthcare delivery, education, and policy.\nNursing informatics, which merges nursing science with information management and communication technologies, is crucial in modern healthcare. The emergence of AI presents opportunities to improve diagnostics, treatment, and healthcare resource management. However, integrating AI into nursing practice also brings challenges, including ethical concerns and the need for specialized training.\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 2013 to December 2023 using databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. Articles were selected based on their relevance to AI's role in nursing informatics, particularly in enhancing patient care and healthcare efficiency.\nAI significantly enhances nursing practice by improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing care plans, and supporting resource allocation. However, its adoption raises ethical issues, such as data privacy concerns and biases within AI algorithms. Ensuring that nurses are adequately trained in AI technologies is essential for safe and effective integration.\nPolicymakers should promote AI literacy programs for healthcare professionals and develop ethical guidelines to govern the use of AI in healthcare. This will ensure that AI tools are implemented responsibly, protecting patient rights and enhancing healthcare outcomes.\nAI offers promising advancements in nursing informatics, leading to more efficient patient care and improved decision-making. Nonetheless, overcoming ethical challenges and ensuring AI literacy among nurses are critical steps for successful implementation.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving area, having had a transformative effect within some areas of medicine and dentistry. In dentistry, AI systems are contributing to clinical decision-making, diagnostics and treatment planning. Ongoing advances in AI technology will lead to further expansion of its existing applications and more widespread use within the field of dentistry. The predicted transformation of current practice within dentistry brought about by AI necessitates the education of undergraduate dental students on the topic of AI. AI will act as a complementary tool to clinical expertise and skill, rather than a replacement. AI education frameworks should integrate with existing traditional dental education. It is important that dental students develop a sound understanding of the ethical considerations surrounding AI, ensuring its safe and responsible use. This article aims to consider the status of current undergraduate dental education and the possible impact of AI, examining both the challenges and opportunities, and the practicalities, of incorporating AI into existing undergraduate dental curricula. Understanding and envisioning the future landscape shaped by AI will allow for development of a future dental workforce who are skilled, confident and responsible AI users.",

    "abstract": "Integrating prior epidemiological knowledge embedded within mechanistic models with the data-mining capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential for epidemiological modeling. While the fusion of AI and traditional mechanistic approaches is rapidly advancing, efforts remain fragmented. This scoping review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging integrated models applied across the spectrum of infectious diseases. Through systematic search strategies, we identified 245 eligible studies from 15,460 records. Our review highlights the practical value of integrated models, including advances in disease forecasting, model parameterization, and calibration. However, key research gaps remain. These include the need for better incorporation of realistic decision-making considerations, expanded exploration of diverse datasets, and further investigation into biological and socio-behavioral mechanisms. Addressing these gaps will unlock the synergistic potential of AI and mechanistic modeling to enhance understanding of disease dynamics and support more effective public health planning and response.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this review is to evaluate the contributions of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART), focusing on its role in enhancing the processes and outcomes of fertility treatments. This study analyzed 48 relevant articles to assess the impact of AI on various aspects of ART, including treatment efficacy, process optimization, and outcome prediction. The effectiveness of different machine learning paradigms-supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning-in improving ART-related procedures was particularly examined. The findings indicate that AI technologies significantly enhance ART processes by refining tasks such as embryo and sperm analysis and facilitating personalized treatment plans based on predictive modeling. Notable improvements were observed in the accuracy of diagnosing and predicting successful outcomes in fertility treatments. AI-driven models provided more precise forecasts of the optimal timing for clinical interventions such as egg retrieval and embryo transfer, which are critical to the success of ART cycles. The integration of AI into ART represents a transformative advancement, substantially improving the precision and efficiency of fertility treatments. The continuous evolution of AI methodologies is likely to further revolutionize this field, enabling more tailored and successful treatment approaches. AI is becoming an indispensable tool in reproductive medicine, enhancing both the effectiveness of treatments and the clinical decision-making process. This review underscores the potential of AI to act as a catalyst for innovative solutions in the optimization of ART.",

    "abstract": "To conduct a scoping review on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in clear aligner therapy and to assess the extent of AI integration and automation in orthodontic software currently available to orthodontists.\nA systematic electronic literature search was performed in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. Also, grey literature resources up to March 2024 were reviewed. English-language studies on potential AI applications for clear aligner therapy were included based on an independent evaluation by two reviewers. An assessment of the automation steps in orthodontic software available on the market up to March 2024 was also conducted.\nOut of 708 studies, 41 were included. Sixteen articles focused on tooth segmentation, four on registration of digital models, 13 on digital setup, and eight on remote monitoring. Moreover, 13 aligner software programs were identified and assessed for their level of automation. Only one software demonstrated complete automation of the steps involved in the orthodontic digital workflow.\nNone of the 13 identified aligner software programs were evaluated in the 41 included studies. However, AI-based tooth segmentation achieved 98% accuracy, while AI effectively merged CBCT and IOS data, supported digital measurements, predicted treatment outcomes, and showed potential for remote monitoring.\nAI applications in clear aligner therapy are on the rise. This scoping review enables orthodontists to identify AI-based solutions in orthodontic planning and understand its implications, which can potentially enhance treatment efficiency, accuracy, and predictability.",

    "abstract": "This review focuses on opportunities and challenges of future AI developments in veterinary medicine, from the perspective of computer science researchers in developing AI systems for animal behavior analysis. We examine the paradigms of supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and foundation models, highlighting their applications and limitations in automating animal behavior analysis. These emerging technologies present future challenges in data, modeling, and evaluation in veterinary medicine. To address this, we advocate for a collaborative approach that integrates the expertise of AI researchers, veterinary professionals, and other stakeholders to navigate the evolving landscape of AI in veterinary medicine. Through cross-domain dialogue and an emphasis on human and animal well-being, we can shape AI development to advance veterinary practice for the benefit of all.",

Performance was scored using bilateral IMU-HAs and compared to scores by clinicians blinded to the hearing aid measures.\nFall risk categorizations based on 4-Stage Balance, Timed Up and Go (TUG), and 30-Second Chair Stand tests obtained from IMU-HAs and clinicians.\nInterrater reliability was excellent across all clinicians. The 4-Stage Balance and TUG showed no statistically significant differences between clinician and HAs. However, the IMU-HAs failed to record a response in 12% of TUG trials. For the 30-Second Chair Stand test, there was a significant difference of nearly one stand count, which would have altered fall risk classification in 21% of participants.\nThese results suggest that fall risk as determined by the STEADI tests was in most instances similar for IMU-HAs and trained observers; however, differences were observed in certain situations, suggesting improvements are needed in the algorithm to maximize accurate fall risk categorization.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the transfer of more than one embryo has become less frequent to diminish multiple pregnancies. Even so, there is still a risk of one embryo splitting into two or even three. This report presents the case of a triamniotic monochorionic gestation in a 35-year-old woman, obtained after the transfer of a single day 5 embryo that had been previously hatched with a laser and subsequently transferred in a fresh IVF cycle. The morphokinetics of this embryo as well as another eight that produced monozygotic twins were compared with nine embryos that achieved singleton gestations. An artificial intelligence (AI) system was used to perform this analysis objectively. Embryo divisions leading to multiple gestations were slower across all analysed parameters. This was most evident in the time taken to reach the 5-cell stage (t5) (48.74\u2009\u00b1\u20093.21 versus 44.69\u2009\u00b1\u20095.61\u2009h) and the morula stage (tM) (85.08\u2009\u00b1\u200910.00 versus 78.13\u2009\u00b1\u20095.35\u2009h). Moreover, blastocyst diameter (161.80\u2009\u00b1\u200926.50 versus 179.10\u2009\u00b1\u200925.88\u2009\u03bcm) and area (21\u00a0684\u2009\u00b1\u20097267.4 versus 26\u00a0516\u2009\u00b1\u20097254.8 \u03bcm2) were smaller in these embryos, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. This is the first report, to our knowledge, to use AI to analyse and compare morphokinetic parameters between singleton pregnancies and a group of embryos that produced twin and triplet pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive gastric cancer (GC) shows a robust response to the combined therapy based HER2-targeted therapy. The application of these therapies is highly dependent on the evaluation of tumor HER2 status. However, there are many risks and challenges in HER2 assessment in GC. Therefore, an economically viable and readily available instrument is requisite for distinguishing HER2 status among patients diagnosed with GC. The study has innovatively developed a deep learning model, HER2Net, which can predict the HER2 status by quantitatively calculating the proportion of HER2 high-expression regions. The HER2Net is trained on an internal training set derived from 531 hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) whole slide images (WSI) of 520 patients. Subsequently, the performance of HER2Net is validated on an internal test set from 115 H&E WSI of 111 patients and an external multi-center test set from 102 H&E WSI of 101 patients. The HER2Net achieves an accuracy of 0.9043 on the internal test set, and an accuracy of 0.8922 on an external test set from multiple institutes. This discovery indicates that the HER2Net can potentially offer a novel methodology for the identification of HER2-positive GC.",

    "abstract": "Determining spectacle-corrected visual acuity (VA) is essential when managing many ophthalmic diseases. If artificial intelligence (AI) evaluations of macular images estimated this VA from a fundus image, AI might provide spectacle-corrected VA without technician costs, reduce visit time, or facilitate home monitoring of VA from fundus images obtained outside of the clinic.\nTo estimate spectacle-corrected VA measured on a standard eye chart among patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) in clinical practice settings using previously validated AI algorithms evaluating best-corrected VA from fundus photographs in eyes with DME.\nRetrospective cross-sectional evaluation of deidentified fundus photographs matched to spectacle-corrected VA determined by technicians on eye charts among patients with a history of DME based on optical coherence tomography and at least 2 visits within 1 to 6 months of each other at a university-based clinic between January 2014 and December 2022. Data were analyzed from January 2023 to October 2024.\nPreviously validated AI algorithm evaluation of fundus photographs.\nAI-determined VA mean absolute error (MAE) compared with actual spectacle-corrected VA.\nAmong 141 patients, the mean (SD) age was 63 (13) years, 71 (50%) were male, 2 (1%) were Asian, 42 (30%) were Black or African American, and 88 (63%) were White. Among 282 eyes at visit 1, 66 had nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and DME, 38 had proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and DME, 101 had NPDR and no DME, and 77 had PDR and no DME. Among 564 images (282 eyes) at both initial and follow-up visits, MAE (SD) among eyes with NPDR, with or without center-involved DME (CI-DME), was 1.16 (1.00) lines on the eye chart for VA between 20/10 and 20/20 (67 images), and 1.44 (1.15) lines for between VA 20/25 and 20/80 (231 images). MAE (SD) among eyes with PDR, with or without CI-DME, was 1.92 (1.08) lines for VA between 20/10 and 20/20 (50 images), and 1.42 (0.97) lines for spectacle-corrected VA between 20/25 and 20/80 (150 images). Only 65 images had VA 20/100 or worse, precluding meaningful analyses.\nIn this cross-sectional study, AI evaluation of fundus photographs among patients with DME and VA 20/80 or better estimated spectacle-corrected VA within approximately 1 to 1.5 lines of actual spectacle-corrected VA. These results support use of AI evaluation of fundus photographs to determine spectacle-corrected VA among patients with DME globally, beyond ophthalmology offices.",

    "abstract": "Screening diabetic retinopathy (DR) for timely management can reduce global blindness. Many existing DR screening programs worldwide are non-digital, standalone, and deployed with grading retinal photographs by trained personnel. To integrate the screening programs, with or without artificial intelligence (AI), into hospital information systems to improve their effectiveness, the non-digital workflow must be transformed into digital. We developed a cloud-based digital platform and implemented it in an existing DR screening program.\nWe conducted the following processes in the platform for prospective DR screening at a community hospital: capturing patients' retinal photographs, uploading them for grading by AI or trained personnel on alternate weeks for 32\u00a0weeks, and referring vision-threatening DR to a referral center. At this center, the platform was applied for the assessment of potential missed referrals via remote over-reading by a retinal specialist and tracking referrals. Implementational outcomes, such as detecting positive cases, agreement between AI and over-reading, and referral adherence were assessed.\nOf 645 patients screened by AI, 201 (31.2%) were referrals, 129 (64.2%) of which were true positives agreeable by over-reading; 115 of these true positives (89.1%) had referral adherence. False negatives judged by over-reading were 1.1% (5/444). Of 730 patients in manual screening, 175 (24.0%) were potential referrals, 11 (6.3%) of which were referred at the point-of-screening; eight of these (72.7%) adhered to referral. The remaining 164 cases were appointed for later examination by a visiting general ophthalmologist; 11 of these 116 examined (9.5%) were referred for non-DR-related eye conditions with 81.8% (9/11) referral adherence. No system failure or interruption was found.\nThe digital platform can be practically integrated into the existing non-digital DR screening programs to implement AI and monitor previously unknown but important indicators, such as referral adherence, to improve the effectiveness of the programs.\nClinicalTrials.gov.

    "abstract": "This narrative review examines the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in organ retrieval and transplantation. AI and ML technologies enhance donor-recipient matching by integrating and analyzing complex datasets encompassing clinical, genetic, and demographic information, leading to more precise organ allocation and improved transplant success rates. In surgical planning, AI-driven image analysis automates organ segmentation, identifies critical anatomical features, and predicts surgical outcomes, aiding pre-operative planning and reducing intraoperative risks. Predictive analytics further enable personalized treatment plans by forecasting organ rejection, infection risks, and patient recovery trajectories, thereby supporting early intervention strategies and long-term patient management. AI also optimizes operational efficiency within transplant centers by predicting organ demand, scheduling surgeries efficiently, and managing inventory to minimize wastage, thus streamlining workflows and enhancing resource allocation. Despite these advancements, several challenges hinder the widespread adoption of AI and ML in organ transplantation. These include data privacy concerns, regulatory compliance issues, interoperability across healthcare systems, and the need for rigorous clinical validation of AI models. Addressing these challenges is essential to ensuring the reliable, safe, and ethical use of AI in clinical settings. Future directions for AI and ML in transplantation medicine include integrating genomic data for precision immunosuppression, advancing robotic surgery for minimally invasive procedures, and developing AI-driven remote monitoring systems for continuous post-transplantation care. Collaborative efforts among clinicians, researchers, and policymakers are crucial to harnessing the full potential of AI and ML, ultimately transforming transplantation medicine and improving patient outcomes while enhancing healthcare delivery efficiency.",

    "abstract": "To create a computer-aided prediction (CAP) system to predict Wilms tumor (WT) responsiveness to preoperative chemotherapy (PC) using pre-therapy contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT).\nA single-center database was reviewed for children <18 years diagnosed with WT and received PC between 2001 and 2021. Patients were excluded if pre- and post-PC CECT were not retrievable. According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, volumetric response was considered favorable if PC resulted in \u226530% tumor volume reduction. Histological response was considered favorable if post-nephrectomy specimens had \u226566% necrosis. Four steps were used to create the prediction model: tumor delineation; extraction of shape, texture and functionality-based features; integration of the extracted features and selection of the prediction model with the highest diagnostic performance. K-fold cross-validation allowed the presentation of all data in the training and testing phases.\nA total of 63 tumors in 54 patients were used to train and test the prediction model. Patients were treated with 4-8 weeks of vincristine/actinomycin-D combination. Favorable volumetric and histologic responses were achieved in 46 tumors (73.0%) and 38 tumors (60.3%), respectively. Among machine learning classifiers, support vector machine had the best diagnostic performance with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95.24%, 95.65%, and 94.12% for volumetric and 84.13%, 89.47%, 88% for histologic response prediction.\nBased on pre-therapy CECT, CAP systems can help identify WT that are less likely to respond to PC with excellent accuracy. These tumors can be offered upfront surgery, avoiding the cons of PC.",

Approaches using photographs assessed by artificial intelligence (AI) may make food logging easier, if they are adequately accurate.\nWe used OpenAI's GPT-4o model with one-shot prompts and no fine-tuning to assess energy, fat, protein, carbohydrate, fiber, and salt through photographs of 22 meals, comparing assessments to weighed food records for each meal and to assessments of dieticians.\nThe model had poor performance overall. For fiber, though, the model achieved an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.71 (0.67-0.74 95% CI), well above the dietician performance of 0.57.\nThe simplest use of current AI via one-shot prompting and no fine-tuning accurately assesses fiber content in meals but is inaccurate for other nutritional parameters.",

    "abstract": "Due to considerable tumour heterogeneity, stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) has a poor prognosis and varies in response to treatment, making it one of the main causes of cancer-related mortality globally. Recent data point to a significant role for metabolic reprogramming, namely dysregulated lactic acid metabolism, in the evolution of STAD and treatment resistance. This study used a series of artificial intelligence-related approaches to identify IGFBP7, a Schlafen family member, as a critical factor in determining the response to immunotherapy and lactic acid metabolism in STAD patients. Computational analyses revealed that a high lactic metabolism (LM) state was associated with poor survival in STAD patients. Further biological network-based investigations identified a key subnetwork closely linked to LM. Machine learning techniques, such as random forest and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, highlighted IGFBP7 as a crucial indicator in STAD. Functional annotations showed that IGFBP7 expression was linked to important immune and inflammatory pathways. In\u00a0vitro experiments demonstrated that silencing IGFBP7 suppressed cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, heightened susceptibility to several chemotherapeutic drugs was linked to elevated IGFBP7 levels. In conclusion, this work sheds light on the mechanisms by which the lactate metabolism-related indicator IGFBP7 affects the tumour immune milieu and the response to immunotherapy in STAD. The results point to IGFBP7 as a possible therapeutic target and predictive biomarker for the treatment of STAD.",

    "abstract": "\"I see, I forget, I read aloud, I remember, and when I do read purposefully by writing it, I do not forget it.\" This phenomenon is known as \"interoception\" and refers to the sensing and interpretation of internal body signals, allowing the brain to communicate with various body systems. Dysfunction in interoception is associated with cardiovascular disorders. We delve into the concept of interoception and its impact on heart failure (HF) by reviewing and exploring neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive processing. Furthermore, we review the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosis, biomarker development, and HF treatment. In the context of HF, AI algorithms can analyze and interpret complex interoceptive data, providing valuable insights for diagnosis and treatment. These algorithms can identify patterns of disease markers that can contribute to early detection and diagnosis, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. These biomarkers hold significant potential in improving the precision/efficacy of HF. Additionally, AI-powered technologies offer promising avenues for treatment. By leveraging patient data, AI can personalize therapeutic interventions. AI-driven technologies such as remote monitoring devices and wearable sensors enable the monitoring of patients' health. By harnessing the power of AI, we should aim to advance the diagnosis and treatment strategies for HF. This review explores the potential of AI in diagnosing, developing biomarkers, and managing HF.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance refers to the ability of pathogens to develop resistance to drugs designed to eliminate them, making the infections they cause more difficult to treat and increasing the likelihood of disease diffusion and mortality. As such, antimicrobial resistance is considered as one of the most significant and universal challenges to both health and society, as well as the environment. In our research, we employ the explainable artificial intelligence paradigm to identify the factors that most affect the onset of antimicrobial resistance in diversified territorial contexts, which can vary widely from each other in terms of climatic, economic and social conditions. Specifically, we employ a large set of indicators identified through the One Health framework to predict, at the country level, mortality resulting from antimicrobial resistance related to Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The analysis reveals the outstanding importance of indicators related to water accessibility and quality in determining mortality due to antimicrobial resistance to the considered pathogens across countries, providing perspective as a potential tool for decision support and monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Humanity faces many health challenges, among which respiratory diseases are one of the leading causes of human death. Existing AI-driven pre-diagnosis approaches can enhance the efficiency of diagnosis but still face challenges. For example, single-modal data suffer from information redundancy or loss, difficulty in learning relationships between features, and revealing the obscure characteristics of complex diseases. Therefore, it is critical to explore a method that can assist clinicians in detecting lesions early and in pre-diagnosing corresponding diseases.\nThis paper introduces a novel network structure, SCSCS-Net, which can effectively extract image features from chest X-ray images and generate medical image descriptions, assist clinicians in analyzing patients' medical imaging information, deeply explore potential disease characteristics, and assist in making pre-diagnostic decisions. The SCSCS-Net consists of a reinforced cross-modal feature representation model (RCMFR) and a self-critical cross-modal alignment model (SCCMA), which are responsible for learning the features interdependence between images and reports by using a multi-subspace self-attention structure and guiding the model in learning report generation strategies to improve the professionalism and consistency of medical terms in generated reports, respectively.\nWe further compare our model with some advanced models on the same dataset, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance. Finally, the CE and NLG metrics further confirm that the proposed method acquires the ability to generate high-quality medical reports with higher clinical consistency in generating medical reports.\nOur novel method has the potential to improve the early detection and pre-diagnosis of respiratory diseases. The model proposed in this paper allows to narrow the gap between Artificial intelligence technology and clinical medical diagnosis and provides the possibility for in-depth integration.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing the speed and efficiency of clinical trial recruitment is a key objective across international health systems. This study aimed to use artificial intelligence (AI) applied in the Victorian Cancer Registry (VCR), a population-based cancer registry, to assess (1) if VCR received all relevant pathology reports for three clinical trials, (2) AI accuracy in auto-extracting information from pathology reports for recruitment, and (3) the number of participants approached for trial enrollment using the AI approach compared with standard hospital-based recruitment.\nTo verify pathology report accessibility for VCR trial enrollment, reports from the laboratory were cross-referenced. To determine the accuracy of a Rapid Case Ascertainment (RCA) module of the AI software in extracting key clinical variables from the pathology report, data were compared with manually reviewed reports. To examine the effectiveness of the AI recruitment approach, the number of patients approached for recruitment was compared with standard practice.\nOf the 195 reports provided by the pathology laboratory, 185 (94.9%) were received by VCR, 73 of 195 (37.4%) were eligible for the studies, and 5 of 73 (6.8%) eligible cases had not been received by the VCR. The RCA module demonstrated an accuracy of 93% and an F1 score of 0.94 in extracting key clinical variables. However, the RCA false-positive rate was 10% and the false-negative rate was 5%. The standard hospital approach selected fewer cases for approach to clinical trials compared with the RCA module approach, 8 of 336 (2.4%) versus 12 of 336 (3.6%), respectively.\nUsing AI to screen potentially eligible cases for recruitment to three clinical trials resulted in a 50% increase in eligible cases being approached for enrollment.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we draw on social identity and social exchange theory to propose pathways via which emotional intelligence directed toward others in the organization has an impact on employee effectiveness. Findings from 122 supervisor-employee dyads showed that employees' other-oriented emotional intelligence is related to their organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) via the mechanisms of building high-quality exchanges with one's leaders and coworkers. We theorize and find evidence for unique mechanisms involved in mediating the effects of other-oriented emotional intelligence on taking charge and helping. Furthermore, both helping others and taking charge influenced performance ratings. We discuss theoretical and practical implications as well as limitations and areas for future research.",

    "abstract": "Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a 175-billion-parameter natural language processing model that uses deep learning algorithms trained on vast amounts of data to generate human-like texts such as essays. Consequently, it has introduced new challenges and threats to medical education. We assessed the use of ChatGPT and other AI tools among medical students in Uganda.\nWe conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study among medical students at four public universities in Uganda from 1st November 2023 to 20th December 2023. Participants were recruited by stratified random sampling. We used a semi-structured questionnaire to collect data on participants' socio-demographics and use of AI tools such as ChatGPT. Our outcome variable was use of AI tools. Data were analyzed descriptively in Stata version 17.0. We conducted a modified Poisson regression to explore the association between use of AI tools and various exposures.\nA total of 564 students participated. Almost all (93%) had heard about AI tools and more than two-thirds (75.7%) had ever used AI tools. Regarding the AI tools used, majority (72.2%) had ever used ChatGPT, followed by SnapChat AI (14.9%), Bing AI (11.5%), and Bard AI (6.9%). Most students use AI tools to complete assignments (55.5%), preparing for tutorials (39.9%), preparing for exams (34.8%) and research writing (24.8%). Students also reported the use of AI tools for nonacademic purposes including emotional support, recreation, and spiritual growth. Older students were 31% less likely to use AI tools compared to younger ones (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio (aPR):0.69; 95% CI: [0.62, 0.76]). Students at Makerere University were 66% more likely to use AI tools compared to students in Gulu University (aPR:1.66; 95% CI:[1.64, 1.69]).\nThe use of ChatGPT and other AI tools was widespread among medical students in Uganda. AI tools were used for both academic and non-academic purposes. Younger students were more likely to use AI tools compared to older students. There is a need to promote AI literacy in institutions to empower older students with essential skills for the digital age. Further, educators should assume students are using AI and adjust their way of teaching and setting exams to suit this new reality. Our research adds further evidence to existing voices calling for regulatory frameworks for AI in medical education.",

Although the impetus is AI, the Guide grounds its path in pedagogical theory, considers the range of human responses, and then deals with assessment types, challenges, AI roles as tutor and learner, and required competencies. It then discusses the difficult and ethical issues, before ending with considerations for faculty development and the technicalities of AI acknowledgment in assessment.

    "abstract": "Traditional computer-assisted detection (CADe) algorithms were developed for 2D mammography, while modern artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can be applied to 2D mammography and/or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). The objective is to compare the performance of a traditional machine learning CADe algorithm for synthetic 2D mammography to a deep learning-based AI algorithm for DBT on the same mammograms.\nMammographic examinations from 764 patients (mean age 58\u00a0years \u00b1 11) with 106 biopsy-proven cancers and 658 cancer-negative cases were analyzed by a CADe algorithm (ImageChecker v10.0, Hologic, Inc.) and an AI algorithm (Genius AI Detection v2.0, Hologic, Inc.). Synthetic 2D images were used for CADe analysis, and DBT images were used for AI analysis. For each algorithm, an overall case score was defined as the highest score of all lesion marks, which was used to determine the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\nThe overall AUC was higher for 3D AI than 2D CADe (0.873 versus 0.693, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Lesion-specific sensitivity of 3D AI was higher than 2D CADe (94.3 versus 72.6%, P\u2009=\u20090.002). Specificity of 3D AI was higher than 2D CADe (54.3 versus 16.7%, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and the rate of false marks on non-cancer cases was lower for 3D AI than 2D CADe (0.91 versus 3.24 per exam, P\u2009<\u20090.001).\nA deep learning-based AI algorithm applied to DBT images significantly outperformed a traditional machine learning CADe algorithm applied to synthetic 2D mammographic images, with regard to AUC, sensitivity, and specificity.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment of heart failure (HF). AI models have demonstrated superior performance in distinguishing healthy individuals from those at risk of congestive HF by analyzing heart rate variability data. In addition, AI clinical decision support systems exhibit high concordance rates with HF experts, enhancing diagnostic precision. For HF with reduced as well as preserved ejection fraction, AI-powered algorithms help detect subtle irregularities in electrocardiograms and other related predictors. AI also aids in predicting HF risk in diabetic patients, using complex data patterns to enhance understanding and management. Moreover, AI technologies help forecast HF-related hospital admissions, enabling timely interventions to reduce readmission rates and improve patient outcomes.

    "abstract": "The food flavor science, traditionally reliant on experimental methods, is now entering a promising era with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). By integrating existing technologies with AI, researchers can explore and develop new flavor substances in a digital environment, saving time and resources. More and more research will use AI and big data to enhance product flavor, improve product quality, meet consumer needs, and drive the industry toward a smarter and more sustainable future. In this review, we elaborate on the mechanisms of flavor recognition and their potential impact on nutritional regulation. With the increase of data accumulation and the development of internet information technology, food flavor databases and food ingredient databases have made great progress. These databases provide detailed information on the nutritional content, flavor molecules, and chemical properties of various food compounds, providing valuable data support for the rapid evaluation of flavor components and the construction of screening technology. With the popularization of AI in various fields, the field of food flavor has also ushered in new development opportunities. This review explores the mechanisms of flavor recognition and the role of AI in enhancing food flavor analysis through high-throughput omics data and screening technologies. AI algorithms offer a pathway to scientifically improve product formulations, thereby enhancing flavor and customized meals. Furthermore, it discusses the safety challenges of integrating AI into the food flavor industry.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the deadliest malignant tumor, with a grim 5-year overall survival rate of about 12%. As its incidence and mortality rates rise, it is likely to become the second-leading cause of cancer-related death. The radiological assessment determined the stage and management of PDAC. However, it is a highly heterogeneous disease with the complexity of the tumor microenvironment, and it is challenging to adequately reflect the biological aggressiveness and prognosis accurately through morphological evaluation alone. With the dramatic development of artificial intelligence (AI), multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) using specific contrast media and special techniques can provide morphological and functional information with high image quality and become a powerful tool in quantifying intratumor characteristics. Besides, AI has been widespread in the field of medical imaging analysis. Radiomics is the high-throughput mining of quantitative image features from medical imaging that enables data to be extracted and applied for better decision support. Deep learning is a subset of artificial neural network algorithms that can automatically learn feature representations from data. AI-enabled imaging biomarkers of mpMRI have enormous promise to bridge the gap between medical imaging and personalized medicine and demonstrate huge advantages in predicting biological characteristics and the prognosis of PDAC. However, current AI-based models of PDAC operate mainly in the realm of a single modality with a relatively small sample size, and the technical reproducibility and biological interpretation present a barrage of new potential challenges. In the future, the integration of multi-omics data, such as radiomics and genomics, alongside the establishment of standardized analytical frameworks will provide opportunities to increase the robustness and interpretability of AI-enabled image biomarkers and bring these biomarkers closer to clinical practice.

    "abstract": "To evaluate the performance of Genki, a computer-aided detection (CADe) software, in detecting tuberculosis (TB) using chest radiography in a mobile TB screening program in Chennai, India.\nGenki, an AI-based CADe software, was employed in four mobile diagnostic units in remote areas of Chennai, India for screening TB. Patients from remote areas of Chennai who visited the vans and registered in the screening program underwent chest radiography, and the acquired X-ray scans were analyzed using Genki, which provided an assessment of each scan as either \"TB suggestive\" or \"TB not suggestive\". Subsequently, sputum or swab from the patients with \"TB suggestive\" results was collected to confirm the diagnosis.\nIn total, 25,598 patients were screened between January and December 2022.

    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of shoulder range of motion (ROM) is crucial for evaluating patient progress. Traditional manual goniometry often lacks precision and is subject to inter-observer variability, especially in measuring shoulder internal rotation (IR). This study introduces an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach that uses clinical photography to improve the accuracy of ROM quantification. We analyzed a total of 150 clinical photographs, including 100 shoulder and 50 elbow images, taken between January and April 2022. An MMPose model with an HR-NET backbone architecture, pre-trained on the COCO-WholeBody dataset, was used to detect 17 anatomical landmarks. A random forest classifier (PoseRF) then categorized poses, and ROM angles were calculated. Concurrently, two clinicians independently measured shoulder IR at the vertebral level, and inter-observer agreement was evaluated. Linear regression analyses were conducted to correlate the AI-derived measurements with the clinicians' assessments. The AI-based algorithm accurately detected anatomical landmarks in 96% of shoulder and 100% of elbow images. Pose detection achieved 95% accuracy overall, with 100% accuracy for specific shoulder (abduction, flexion, external rotation) and elbow (flexion, extension) poses. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between the AI algorithm and human observers ranged from 0.965 to 0.997, indicating excellent inter-observer reliability. Kruskal-Wallis test showed no statistically significant differences in ROM measurements among the AI algorithm and two human observers across all joint angles (\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13534-024-00432-w.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we work with information across disciplines and practical contexts. A growing range of disciplines are now involved in studying, developing and assessing the use of AI in practice, but these disciplines often employ conflicting understandings of what AI is and what is involved in its use. New, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to bridge competing conceptualizations of AI in practice and help shape the future of AI use. I propose a novel conceptual framework called AI Thinking, which models key decisions and considerations involved in AI use across disciplinary perspectives. AI Thinking addresses five practice-based competencies involved in applying AI in context: motivating AI use, formulating AI methods, assessing available tools and technologies, selecting appropriate data and situating AI in the sociotechnical contexts it is used in. A hypothetical case study is provided to illustrate the application of AI Thinking in practice. This article situates AI Thinking in broader cross-disciplinary discourses of AI, including its connections to ongoing discussions around AI literacy and AI-driven innovation. AI Thinking can help to bridge between the work of diverse disciplines, contexts and actors in the AI space, and shape AI efforts in education, industrial development and policy.",

The 2023 Executive Order, Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, requires an assessment of how AI can increase biorisk. Within this perspective, quantitative and qualitative frameworks for evaluating biorisk are presented. Both frameworks are exercised using notional scenarios and their benefits and limitations are then discussed. Finally, the perspective concludes by noting that assessment and evaluation methodologies must keep pace with advances of AI in the life\u00a0sciences.",

    "abstract": "The need for educational institutions to create a conducive learning environment for participation of all students in school activities is one of the pillars advocated under Goal 4 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. While there are structures institutionalized to promote students' well-being, universities are faced with a myriad of challenges which can negatively impact mental health and disrupt the overall learning experiences of students. This study explored the relationship between Emotional Intelligence and Self-Esteem which have been found to influence the mental health of students.\nInformed by the cross-sectional design, one thousand and twenty (N\u2009=\u20091020) university students were recruited to self-report their Emotional Intelligence and Self-Esteem. The participants completed the Schutte Emotional Intelligence scale and the Rosenberg's Self-Esteem scale. The data were validated using confirmatory factor analysis, means were computed, followed by multivariate analysis of variance and hierarchical multiple regression.\nThe study showed that participants were ambivalent on both EI and self-esteem. The hypothesized relationship between Emotional Intelligence and Self-Esteem was supported by the study findings. More so, demographic variables such as gender, religion and programme of study provided further insight into Emotional Intelligence and Self-Esteem of participants.\nIn conclusion, the researchers of this study called on educators and university administrators to prioritize the Emotional Intelligence and Self-Esteem of students in mental health interventions. The need for partnership between administrators and religious leaders and other study implications, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the mediating role of social intelligence in the effect of nurses' work-related strain on trait anger and anger expressions. The challenging working conditions for nurses often result in increased strain and anger. Social intelligence could help to manage anger.\nThis cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted with 446 nurses at a public hospital in T\u00fcrkiye between April and May, 2021. The questionnaire consisted of socio demographics, Trait Anger and Anger Expression Inventory, Tromso Social Intelligent Scale, and Work-Related Strain Inventory. The data was collected face to face. Descriptive statistics and Pearson's correlation coefficient were conducted using SPSS (v.26) and mediation analysis was conducted using PROCESS macro (Hayes, model 4).\nSocial intelligence played a mediating role in the effect of work-related strain on trait anger, anger-in, anger-out, and anger-control (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.105, \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.100, \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.131, \u03b2=-0.136, respectively). Social intelligence reduced the effect of work-related strain on trait anger and anger in/out expressions, while increasing anger control.\nThe findings of this study show that social intelligence could be used to manage anger of nurses. Nurse managers could implement initiatives aimed at managing nurses' anger and anger expressions through the decreasing of work-related strain and increasing of nurses' social intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of syphilis is vital for its effective control. This study aimed to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) diagnostic model based on radiomics technology to distinguish early syphilis from other clinical skin lesions.\nThe study collected 260 images of skin lesions caused by various skin infections, including 115 syphilis and 145 other infection types. 80% of the dataset was used for model development with 5-fold cross-validation, and the remaining 20% was used as a hold-out test set. The exact lesion region was manually segmented as Region of Interest (ROI) in each image with the help of two experts. 102 radiomics features were extracted from each ROI and fed into 11 different classifiers after deleting the redundant features using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Different image filters like Wavelet were investigated to improve the model performance. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used for evaluation, and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for model interpretation.\nAmong the 11 classifiers, the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) with the wavelet filter applied on the images demonstrated the best performance, offering the stratified 5-fold cross-validation AUC of 0.832\u2009\u00b1\u20090.042 and accuracy of 0.735\u2009\u00b1\u20090.043. On the hold-out test dataset, the model shows an AUC and accuracy of 0.792 and 0.750, respectively. The SHAP analysis shows that the shape 2D sphericity was the most predictive radiomics feature for distinguishing early syphilis from other skin infections.\nThe proposed AI diagnostic model, built based on radiomics features and machine learning classifiers, achieved an accuracy of 75.0%, and demonstrated potential in distinguishing early syphilis from other skin lesions.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that can result in a progressive loss of speech due to bulbar dysfunction, which can have significant negative impact on the patient's mental well-being. Alternative Augmentative Communication (AAC) strategies based on synthetic voices have been shown to assist patients in maintaining communication and improving their Quality of Life (QoL). However, such synthetic voices are often perceived as impersonal and fail to capture the unique voice and identity of the patient. To tackle this issue, combining voice banking (VB) and artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a more natural communication strategy, enabling individuals to preserve their voice for use with AAC devices as needed. This involves recording speech samples to generate a synthetic voice closely resembling the individual's own. Despite the increasing interest in VB, there's a lack of clear strategies for its effective implementation in rapidly progressing diseases like ALS. Additionally, the perceptual quality of VB on patients with preserved speech, especially when offered early in the disease, remains poorly understood. In light of these challenges, this study aims to assess the effectiveness and the perceptual impact of AI-generated voices on ALS patients with preserved speech, utilizing a personalized voice synthesis system based on machine learning. The AI-generated patient-specific voice is achieved through voice recording, followed by fine-tuning using a Generative Adversarial Network for Efficient and High Fidelity Speech Synthesis (HiFi-GAN), resulting in a model capable of producing speech highly similar to the patient's own voice, with exceptional expressive and audio quality. By addressing these aspects, this study intends to offer valuable insights into the potential benefits and challenges of combining VB with AI voices to enhance communication support for ALS patients.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate how deep learning and other artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can be used to enhance the intelligent level of dance instruction. The study develops a dance action recognition and feedback model based on the Graph Attention Mechanism (GA) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (3D-Resnet-BigRu). In this model, time series features are captured using BiGRU after 3D-ResNet is inserted to extract video features. Lastly, GA dynamically modifies the node weights to maximize action recognition performance. According to the experimental results, this model's F1 score is 85.34%, and its maximum accuracy on the NTU-RGBD60 datasets is more than 5% greater than that of the current 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) baseline algorithm. In addition, the model shows high efficiency and resource utilization in test time, training time and CPU occupancy. The research shows that this model has strong competitiveness in dealing with complex dance action recognition tasks, and provides efficient and personalized technical support for future dance teaching. Meanwhile, the model provides a powerful tool for dance educators to support their teaching activities and enhance students' learning experience.",

    "abstract": "Infertility affects one-in-six couples, often necessitating in vitro fertilization treatment (IVF). IVF generates complex data, which can challenge the utilization of the full richness of data during decision-making, leading to reliance on simple 'rules-of-thumb'. Machine learning techniques are well-suited to analyzing complex data to provide data-driven recommendations to improve decision-making. In this multi-center study (n =\u00a019,082 treatment-naive female patients), including 11 European IVF centers, we harnessed explainable artificial intelligence to identify follicle sizes that contribute most to relevant downstream clinical outcomes. We found that intermediately-sized follicles were most important to the number of mature oocytes subsequently retrieved. Maximizing this proportion of follicles by the end of ovarian stimulation was associated with improved live birth rates. Our data suggests that larger mean follicle sizes, especially those >18 mm, were associated with premature progesterone elevation by the end of ovarian stimulation and a negative impact on live birth rates with fresh embryo transfer. These data highlight the potential of computer technologies to aid in the personalization of IVF to optimize clinical outcomes pending future prospective validation.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies use a three-part strategy for facial visual enhancement: (1) Facial Detection, (2) Facial Landmark Detection, and (3) Filter Application (Chen in Arch Fac Plast Surg 21:361-367, 2019). In the context of the surgical patient population, open-source AI algorithms are capable of modifying or simulating images to present potential results of plastic surgery procedures. Our primary aim was to understand whether AI filter use may influence individuals' perceptions and expectations of post-surgical outcomes.\nWe utilized Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform and collected information on prior experience using AI-driven visual enhancement. The cohort was divided into two groups: AI-exposed and non-AI-exposed. Questions gauged confidence in plastic surgery's ability to meet participant expectations. A second survey exposed users to either AI-enhanced or to unenhanced pre-operative photographs. Then, unedited post-operative photographs were shown and surgery's ability to enhance appearance was assessed. A multivariable linear analysis was constructed to measure associations between exposure to AI enhancement and survey outcomes.\nA total of 426 responses were analysed: 66.9% with AI exposure and 33.1% with no prior exposure. Participants with previous experience using AI-driven enhancers had a significantly higher average score for expectations after plastic surgery (P\u2009<\u20090.001). This finding was true across all outcomes, including surgery's ability to relieve discomfort with appearance/self-esteem (P\u2009<\u20090.001), to avoid post-operative complications (P\u2009<\u20090.001), to decrease post-operative scarring (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and to improve overall appearance (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The image comparison survey revealed that post-operative images were viewed as more successful at improving appearance when no pre-operative filter was applied (P\u2009=\u20090.151).\nExposure to AI photograph enhancement may significantly raise expectations for plastic surgery outcomes and may predispose to having lower satisfaction after surgery. The significance of this study lies in its potential to reveal the extent to which AI technologies can shape patient understanding of their plastic surgery outcomes. Plastic surgeons aware of the effect of AI enhancement may consider using these results to guide counselling.\nhis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming rheumatology research, with a myriad of studies aiming to improve diagnosis, prognosis and treatment prediction, while also showing potential capability to optimise the research workflow, improve drug discovery and clinical trials. Machine learning, a key element of discriminative AI, has demonstrated the ability of accurately classifying rheumatic diseases and predicting therapeutic outcomes by using diverse data types, including structured databases, imaging and text. In parallel, generative AI, driven by large language models, is becoming a powerful tool for optimising the research workflow by supporting with content generation, literature review automation and clinical decision support. This review explores the current applications and future potential of both discriminative and generative AI in rheumatology. It also highlights the challenges posed by these technologies, such as ethical concerns and the need for rigorous validation and regulatory oversight. The integration of AI in rheumatology promises substantial advancements but requires a balanced approach to optimise benefits and minimise potential possible downsides.",

    "abstract": "Inaccurate prediction of lymph node metastasis (LNM) may lead to unnecessary surgery following endoscopic resection of T1 colorectal cancer (CRC). We aimed to validate the usefulness of artificial intelligence (AI) models for predicting LNM in patients with T1 CRC.\nWe analyzed the clinical data, laboratory results, pathological reports, and endoscopic findings of patients who underwent radical surgery for T1 CRC. We developed AI models to predict LNM using four algorithms: regularized logistic regression classifier (RLRC), random forest classifier (RFC), CatBoost classifier (CBC), and the voting classifier (VC). Four histological factors and four endoscopic findings were included to develop AI models. Areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROCs) were measured to distinguish AI model performance in accordance with the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum guidelines.\nAmong 1,386 patients with T1 CRC, 173 patients (12.5%) had LNM. The AUROC values of the RLRC, RFC, CBC, and VC models for LNM prediction were significantly higher (0.673, 0.640, 0.679, and 0.677, respectively) than the 0.525 suggested in accordance with the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum guidelines (vs RLRC, p<0.001; vs RFC, p=0.001; vs CBC, p<0.001; vs VC, p<0.001). The AUROC value was similar between T1 colon versus T1 rectal cancers (0.718 vs 0.615, p=0.700). The AUROC value was also similar between the initial endoscopic resection and initial surgery groups (0.581 vs 0.746, p=0.845).\nAI models trained on the basis of endoscopic findings and pathological features performed well in predicting LNM in patients with T1 CRC regardless of tumor location and initial treatment method.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to identify distinct trajectories of perceived stress and control in athletes across a season of sports competitions and whether these trajectory memberships could be predicted by subdimensions of the emotional intelligence (EI). Latent class growth analyses were performed on a five-stage longitudinal measurement plan (to cover the entire sporting season). Four hundred fifteen athletes answered to the Brief Emotional Intelligence Scale, the Mastery Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Attainment of Sport Achievement Goal Scale. The analyses revealed two trajectories of perceived stress (one trajectory adapted and one maladapted to performance) and two trajectories of perceived control (one trajectory adapted and one maladapted to performance). Moreover, athletes with higher emotional intelligence emotion regulation scores belong significantly more to performance-adaptive trajectories. The obtained results could contribute to the advancement of emotional intelligence intervention programs to optimize the dynamics of perceived stress and control within the sporting season.",

    "abstract": "Many members of Black American communities, faced with the high prevalence of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) within their demographic, find themselves taking on the role of informal caregivers. Despite being the primary individuals responsible for the care of individuals with ADRD, these caregivers often lack sufficient knowledge about ADRD-related health literacy and feel ill-prepared for their caregiving responsibilities. Generative AI has become a new promising technological innovation in the health care domain, particularly for improving health literacy; however, some generative AI developments might lead to increased bias and potential harm toward Black American communities. Therefore, rigorous development of generative AI tools to support the Black American community is needed.\nThe goal of this study is to test Lola, a multimodal mobile app, which, by relying on generative AI, facilitates access to ADRD-related health information by enabling speech and text as inputs and providing auditory, textual, and visual outputs.\nTo test our mobile app, we used the cognitive walk-through methodology, and we recruited 15 informal ADRD caregivers who were older than 50 years and part of the Black American community living within the region. We asked them to perform 3 tasks on the mobile app (ie, searching for an article on brain health, searching for local events, and finally, searching for opportunities to participate in scientific research in their area), then we recorded their opinions and impressions. The main aspects to be evaluated were the mobile app's usability, accessibility, cultural relevance, and adoption.\nOur findings highlight the users' need for a system that enables interaction with different modalities, the need for a system that can provide personalized and culturally and contextually relevant information, and the role of community and physical spaces in increasing the use of Lola.\nOur study shows that, when designing for Black American older adults, a multimodal interaction with the generative AI system can allow individuals to choose their own interaction way and style based upon their interaction preferences and external constraints. This flexibility of interaction modes can guarantee an inclusive and engaging generative AI experience.",

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) requires new approaches for human-AI interfaces that are different from classic human-computer interfaces. In developing a system that is conducive to the analysis and use of health big data (HBD), reflecting the empirical characteristics of users who have performed HBD analysis is the most crucial aspect to consider. Recently, human-centered design methodology, a field of user-centered design, has been expanded and is used not only to develop types of products but also technologies and services.\nThis study was conducted to integrate and analyze users' experiences along the HBD analysis journey using the human-centered design methodology and reflect them in the development of AI agents that support future HBD analysis. This research aims to help accelerate the development of novel human-AI interfaces for AI agents that support the analysis and use of HBD, which will be urgently needed in the near future.\nUsing human-centered design methodology, we collected data through shadowing and in-depth interviews with 16 people with experience in analyzing and using HBD. We identified users' empirical characteristics, emotions, pain points, and needs related to HBD analysis and use and created personas and journey maps.\nThe general characteristics of participants (n=16) were as follows: the majority were in their 40s (n=6, 38%) and held a PhD degree (n=10, 63%). Professors (n=7, 44%) and health care personnel (n=10, 63%) represented the largest professional groups. Participants' experiences with big data analysis varied, with 25% (n=4) being beginners and 38% (n=6) having extensive experience. Common analysis methods included statistical analysis (n=7, 44%) and data mining (n=6, 38%). Qualitative findings from shadowing and in-depth interviews revealed key challenges: lack of knowledge on using analytical solutions, crisis management difficulties during errors, and inadequate understanding of health care data and clinical decision-making, especially among non-health care professionals. Three types of personas and journey maps-health care professionals as big data analysis beginners, health care professionals who have experience in big data analytics, and non-health care professionals who are experts in big data analytics-were derived. They showed a need for personalized platforms tailored to the user level, appropriate direction through a navigation function, a crisis management support system, communication and sharing among users, and expert linkage service.\nThe knowledge obtained from this study can be leveraged in designing an AI agent to support future HBD analysis and use. This is expected to further increase the usability of HBD by helping users perform effective use of HBD more easily.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between maternal obesity and childhood cognitive development remains unclear. Prior studies did not adjust for important confounders, and preterm infants are a developmentally distinct group that remains scarcely examined.\nTo determine whether maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) is associated with offspring intelligence quotient (IQ) up to 5\u2009years and whether this relationship varies with gestational age.\nData from two French birth cohorts, EDEN (all gestational ages) and EPIPAGE-2 (preterm children born between 24 and 34\u2009weeks of gestation), were used for this study. Maternal prepregnancy weight and height were used to calculate prepregnancy BMI. The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence was used to assess child IQ around 5\u2009years. Multivariable models were adjusted for confounders, including socioeconomic status and paternal BMI.\nAnalytical cohorts included 1100 children from EDEN and 2629 from EPIPAGE-2. Lower intellectual functioning (full-scale IQ\u2009<\u200985) was observed in 8.1% of children in EDEN and 19.6% in EPIPAGE-2. The prevalence of maternal obesity was 13.6% (EDEN) and 21.3% (EPIPAGE-2) among children with lower intellectual functioning compared to 8.9% (EDEN) and 12.9% (EPIPAGE-2) among children with normal intellectual functioning. Maternal prepregnancy obesity was associated with an approximately 3-point decrease in full-scale IQ scores in fully adjusted models (adjusted \u03b2 -2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.6, -0.1 and -2.6, 95% CI -4.7, -0.6 in EDEN and EPIPAGE-2, respectively). In EDEN, maternal obesity was associated with lower scores in the verbal IQ domain. Among infants born preterm (EPIPAGE-2), maternal obesity was associated with lower scores in the processing, reasoning, and verbal IQ domains. Adjustment for paternal BMI did not change the magnitude of the relationship with maternal obesity.\nHigh maternal prepregnancy BMI is associated with child cognitive development around 5\u2009years of age.",

    "abstract": "Despite the expanding therapeutic options available to cancer patients, therapeutic resistance, disease recurrence, and metastasis persist as hallmark challenges in the treatment of cancer. The rise to prominence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in many realms of human activities is compelling the consideration of its capabilities as a potential lever to advance the development of effective cancer treatments. This article presents a hypothetical case study on the application of generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) to the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). The case explores the design of GPT-supported adaptive intermittent therapy for mPC. Testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are assumed to be repeatedly monitored while treatment may involve a combination of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), androgen receptor-signalling inhibitors (ARSI), chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The analysis covers various questions relevant to the configuration, training, and inferencing of GPTs for the case of mPC treatment with a particular attention to risk mitigation regarding the hallucination problem and its implications to clinical integration of GenAI technologies. The case study provides elements of an actionable pathway to the realization of GenAI-assisted adaptive treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. As such, the study is expected to help facilitate the design of clinical trials of GenAI-supported cancer treatments.",

    "abstract": "The National Library of Medicine (NLM) currently indexes close to a million articles each year pertaining to more than 5300 medicine and life sciences journals. Of these, a significant number of articles contain critical information about the structure, genetics, and function of genes and proteins in normal and disease states. These articles are identified by the NLM curators, and a manual link is created between these articles and the corresponding gene records at the NCBI Gene database. Thus, the information is interconnected with all the NLM resources, services which bring considerable value to life sciences. National Library of Medicine aims to provide timely access to all metadata, and this necessitates that the article indexing scales to the volume of the published literature. On the other hand, although automatic information extraction methods have been shown to achieve accurate results in biomedical text mining research, it remains difficult to evaluate them on established pipelines and integrate them within the daily workflows.\nHere, we demonstrate how our machine learning model, GNorm2, which achieved state-of-the art performance on identifying genes and their corresponding species at the same time handling innate textual ambiguities, could be integrated with the established daily workflow at the NLM and evaluated for its performance in this new environment.\nWe worked with 8 biomedical curator experts and evaluated the integration using these parameters: (1) gene identification accuracy, (2) interannotator agreement with and without GNorm2, (3) GNorm2 potential bias, and (4) indexing consistency and efficiency. We identified key interface changes that significantly helped the curators to maximize the GNorm2 benefit, and further improved the GNorm2 algorithm to cover 135 species of genes including viral and bacterial genes, based on the biocurator expert survey.\nGNorm2 is currently in the process of being fully integrated into the regular curator's workflow.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) scribes for clinical documentation are likely to be among the first AI tools to affect the day-to-day practice of psychiatry, yet many psychiatrists are unfamiliar with them. This article introduces psychiatrists to AI scribes, including their potential benefits and risks. AI scribes may enhance efficiency, reduce physician burnout, and improve patient-physician rapport by automating documentation processes. Key concerns include privacy, accuracy, and the ability to capture nuanced patient communication. Initial recommendations for responsibly integrating AI scribes into psychiatric practice are provided, emphasizing the importance of balancing technological benefits with careful oversight.",

    "abstract": "To characterize the opinions of patients undergoing infertility treatment on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in their care.\nPatients planning or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) or frozen embryo transfers were invited to complete an anonymous electronic survey from April to June 2024. The survey collected demographics, technological affinity, general perception of AI, and its applications to fertility care. Patient-reported trust of AI compared to a physician for fertility care (e.g. gamete selection, gonadotropin doing, and stimulation length) were analyzed. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and subgroup analyses by age, occupation, and parity were performed. Chi-squared tests were used to compare categorical variables.\nA total of 200 patients completed the survey and were primarily female (n\u2009=\u2009193/200) and of reproductive age (mean 37\u00a0years). Patients were well educated with high technological affinity. Respondents were familiar with AI (93%) and generally supported its use in medicine (55%), but fewer trusted AI-informed reproductive care (46%). More patients disagreed (37%) that AI should be used to determine gonadotropin dose or stimulation length compared to embryo selection (26.5%; p\u2009=\u20090.01). In the setting of disagreement between physician and AI recommendation, patients preferred the physician-based recommendation in all treatment-related decisions. However, a larger proportion favored AI recommendations for gamete (22%) and embryo (14.5%) selection, compared to gonadotropin dosing (6.5%) or stimulation length (7.0%). Most would not be willing to pay more for AI-informed fertility care.\nIn this highly educated infertile population familiar with AI, patients still prefer physician-based recommendations compared with AI.",

    "results": "A total of 200 patients completed the survey and were primarily female (n\u2009=\u2009193/200) and of reproductive age (mean 37\u00a0years). Patients were well educated with high technological affinity. Respondents were familiar with AI (93%) and generally supported its use in medicine (55%), but fewer trusted AI-informed reproductive care (46%). More patients disagreed (37%) that AI should be used to determine gonadotropin dose or stimulation length compared to embryo selection (26.5%; p\u2009=\u20090.01). In the setting of disagreement between physician and AI recommendation, patients preferred the physician-based recommendation in all treatment-related decisions. However, a larger proportion favored AI recommendations for gamete (22%) and embryo (14.5%) selection, compared to gonadotropin dosing (6.5%) or stimulation length (7.0%). Most would not be willing to pay more for AI-informed fertility care.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI-driven technologies are transforming industries across the board, with the pharmaceutical sector emerging as a frontrunner beneficiary. This article explores the growing impact of AI and Machine Learning (ML) within pharmaceutical Regulatory Affairs, particularly in dossier preparation, compilation, documentation, submission, review, and regulatory compliance. By automating time-intensive tasks, these technologies streamline workflows, accelerate result generation, and shorten the product approval timeline. However, despite their immense potential, AI and ML also introduce new challenges. Issues such as AI software validation, data management security and privacy, potential biases, ethical concerns, and change management requirements must be addressed. This review highlights current AI-based tools actively used by regulatory professionals such as DocShifter, Veeva Vault, RiskWatch, Freyr SubmitPro, Litera Microsystems, cortical.io etc., examines both the benefits and obstacles of integrating these advanced systems into regulatory practices. Given the rapid pace of technological innovation, the article underscores the need for proactive collaboration with regulatory bodies to manage these developments. It also stresses the importance of adapting to evolving regulatory frameworks and embracing new technologies. Although regulatory agencies like the United Sates Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) are working on guidelines for AI and ML adoption, clear, standardized protocols are still in the works. While the journey ahead may be complex, the integration of AI promises to fundamentally reshape regulatory processes and accelerate the approval of safe, effective pharmaceutical products.",

    "abstract": "Superficial fungal infections are among the most common infections in world, they mainly affect skin, nails and scalp without further invasion. Superficial fungal diseases are conventionally diagnosed with direct microscopy, fungal culture or histopathology, treated with topical or systemic antifungal agents and prevented in immunocompetent patients by improving personal hygiene. However, conventional diagnostic tests can be time-consuming, also treatment can be insufficient or ineffective and prevention can prove to be demanding. Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a digital system having an intelligence akin to a human being. The concept of AI has existed since 1956, but hasn't been practicalised until recently. AI has revolutionised medical research in the recent years, promising to influence almost all specialties of medicine.\nAn increasing number of articles have been published about the usage of AI in cutaneous mycoses.\nIn this review, the key findings of articles about utilisation of AI in diagnosis, treatment and prevention of superficial fungal infections are summarised. Moreover, the need for more research and development is highlighted.\nFifty-four studies were reviewed. Onychomycosis was the most researched superficial fungal infection. AI can be used diagnosing fungi in macroscopic and microscopic images and classify them to some extent. AI can be a tool and be used as a part of something bigger to diagnose superficial mycoses.\nAI can be used in all three steps of diagnosing, treating and preventing. AI can be a tool complementary to the clinician's skills and laboratory results.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed objective performance, usability, and acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) by people with vision impairment. The goal was to provide evidence-based data to enhance technology selection for people with vision loss (PVL) based on their loss and needs.\nUsing a cross-sectional, counterbalanced, cross-over study involving 25 PVL, we compared performance using two smart glasses (OrCam and Envision Glasses) and two AI apps (Seeing AI and Google Lookout). We refer to these as assistive artificial intelligence implementations (AAIIs). Completion and timing were quantified for three task categories: text, text in columns, and searching and identifying. Usability was evaluated with the System Usability Scale (SUS).\nThe odds ratios (ORs) of being able to complete Text tasks were significantly higher when using AAIIs compared to the baseline. OR when performing \"Searching and Identifying\" tasks varied among AAIIs, with Seeing AI and Envision improving the performance of more tasks than Lookout or OrCam. Participants expressed high satisfaction with the AAIIs.\nDespite the findings that performance on some tasks and when using some AAIIs did not result in a greater number of PVL being able to complete the tasks, there was overall high satisfaction, reflecting an acceptance of AI as an assistive technology and the promise of this developing technology.\nThis evidence-based performance data provide guidelines for clinicians when recommending an AAII to PVL.",

    "abstract": "This paper intends to solve the limitations of the existing methods to deal with the comments of tourist attractions. With the technical support of Artificial Intelligence (AI), an online comment method of tourist attractions based on text mining model and attention mechanism is proposed. In the process of text mining, the attention mechanism is used to calculate the contribution of each topic to text representation on the topic layer of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BiGRU) can effectively capture the temporal relationship and semantic dependence in the text through its powerful sequence modeling ability, thus achieving a more accurate classification of emotional tendencies. In order to verify the performance of the proposed ATT-LDA- Bigelow model, online comments about tourist attractions are collected from Ctrip.com, and users' emotional tendencies towards different scenic spots are analyzed. The results show that this model has the best emotion classification effect in online comments of scenic spots, with the accuracy and F1 value reaching 93.85% and 93.68% respectively, which is superior to other emotion classification models. The proposed method not only improves the accuracy of sentiment analysis, but also provides strong support for the optimization of tourism recommendation system and provides more comprehensive, objective and accurate tourism information for scenic spot managers and tourism enterprises. This achievement is expected to bring new enlightenment and breakthrough to the research and practice in related fields.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly applied in healthcare to improve patient care and clinical outcomes. We previously developed an AI model using ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) codes with other clinical variables to predict in-hospital mortality among trauma patients from a nationwide database. This study aimed to externally validate the performance of the AI model. Validation was conducted using a multicenter retrospective cohort study design, analyzing patient data from January 2020 to December 2021. The study included trauma patients based on specific ICD-10 codes, with other clinical variables. The performance of the AI model was evaluated against conventional metrics, including the ISS, and the ICISS (ICD-based ISS), using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analyses. Data from 4,439 patients were analyzed. The AI model demonstrated high overall performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.9448 and a balanced accuracy of 85.08%, thereby outperforming traditional scoring systems such as ISS, or ICISS. Furthermore, the model accurately predicted mortality across datasets from each hospital (AUROCs of 0.9234 and 0.9653, respectively) despite significant differences in hospital characteristics. In the subset of patients with ISS\u2009<\u20099, the model showed a robust AUROC of 0.9043, indicating its effectiveness in predicting mortality, even in cases with lower-severity injuries. For patients with ISSs\u2009\u2265\u20099, the model maintained high sensitivity (93.60%) and balanced accuracy (77.08%), proving its reliability in more severe injury cases. External validation demonstrated the AI model's high predictive accuracy and reliability in assessing in-hospital mortality risk among trauma patients across different injury severities and heterogeneous cohorts. These findings support the model's potential integration into emergency departments and offer a significant tool for enhancing patient triage and treatment protocols.",

Recent advancements involve using Artificial Neural Network models to enhance predictive accuracy for severe lower gastrointestinal (LGI) bleeding outcomes, including the need for surgery. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI)-guided predictive models have shown promise in improving management outcomes. While much literature focuses on AI in early neoplasia detection, this review highlights AI's role in managing LGI and small bowel disorders, including risk stratification for LGI bleeding, quality control, evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease, and video capsule endoscopy reading. Overall, the integration of AI into routine clinical practice is still developing, with ongoing research aimed at addressing current limitations and gaps in patient care.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) assists recruiting and job searching. Such systems can be biased against certain characteristics. This results in potential misrepresentations and consequent inequalities related to people with mental health disorders. Hence occupational and mental health bias in existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) models used in recruiting and job hunting must be assessed. We examined occupational bias against mental health disorders in NLP models through relationships between occupations, employability, and psychiatric diagnoses. We investigated Word2Vec and GloVe embedding algorithms through analogy questions and graphical representation of cosine similarities. Word2Vec embeddings exhibit minor bias against mental health disorders when asked analogies regarding employability attributes and no evidence of bias when asked analogies regarding high earning jobs. GloVe embeddings view common mental health disorders such as depression less healthy and less employable than severe mental health disorders and most physical health conditions. Overall, physical, and psychiatric disorders are seen as similarly healthy and employable. Both algorithms appear to be safe for use in downstream task without major repercussions. Further research is needed to confirm this. This project was funded by the London Interdisciplinary Social Science Doctoral Training Programme (LISS-DTP). The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence techniques are being used to analyse vast amounts of medical data and assist in the accurate and early diagnosis of diseases. The common brain related diseases are faced by most of the people which affects the structure and function of the brain. Artificial neural networks have been extensively used for disease prediction and diagnosis due to their ability to learn complex patterns and relationships from large datasets. However, there are some problems like over-fitting, under-fitting, vanishing gradient and increased elapsed time occurred in the course of data analysis and prediction which\u00a0results in performance degradation of the model. Therefore, a complex structure perception is much essential by avoiding over-fitting and under-fitting. This empirical study presents a statistical reduction approach along with deep hyper optimization (SRADHO) technique for better feature selection and disease classification with reduced elapsed time. Deep hyper optimization combines deep learning models with hyperparameter tuning to automatically identify the most relevant features, optimizing model accuracy and reducing dimensionality. SRADHO is used to calibrate the weight, bias and select the optimal number of hyperparameters in the hidden layer using Bayesian optimization approach. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic model to efficiently search the hyperparameter space, identifying configurations that maximize model performance while minimizing the number of evaluations. Three benchmark datasets and the classifier models logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, K-nearest neighbour, support vector machine and Na\u00efve Bayes are used for experimentation. The proposed SRADHO algorithm achieves 98.2% of accuracy, 97.2% of precision rate, 98.3% of recall rate and 98.1% of F1-Score value with 0.3% of error rate. The execution time for SRADHO algorithm is 12\u00a0s.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) predictive models in primary health care have the potential to enhance population health by rapidly and accurately identifying individuals who should receive care and health services. However, these models also carry the risk of perpetuating or amplifying existing biases toward diverse groups. We identified a gap in the current understanding of strategies used to assess and mitigate bias in primary health care algorithms related to individuals' personal or protected attributes.\nThis study aimed to describe the attempts, strategies, and methods used to mitigate bias in AI models within primary health care, to identify the diverse groups or protected attributes considered, and to evaluate the results of these approaches on both bias reduction and AI model performance.\nWe conducted a scoping review following Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines, searching Medline (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (Ovid), and Web of Science databases for studies published between January 1, 2017, and November 15, 2022. Pairs of reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, applied selection criteria, and performed full-text screening. Discrepancies regarding study inclusion were resolved by consensus. Following reporting standards for AI in health care, we extracted data on study objectives, model features, targeted diverse groups, mitigation strategies used, and results. Using the mixed methods appraisal tool, we appraised the quality of the studies.\nAfter removing 585 duplicates, we screened 1018 titles and abstracts. From the remaining 189 full-text articles, we included 17 studies. The most frequently investigated protected attributes were race (or ethnicity), examined in 12 of the 17 studies, and sex (often identified as gender), typically classified as \"male versus female\" in 10 of the studies. We categorized bias mitigation approaches into four clusters: (1) modifying existing AI models or datasets, (2) sourcing data from electronic health records, (3) developing tools with a \"human-in-the-loop\" approach, and (4) identifying ethical principles for informed decision-making. Algorithmic preprocessing methods, such as relabeling and reweighing data, along with natural language processing techniques that extract data from unstructured notes, showed the greatest potential for bias mitigation. Other methods aimed at enhancing model fairness included group recalibration and the application of the equalized odds metric. However, these approaches sometimes exacerbated prediction errors across groups or led to overall model miscalibrations.\nThe results suggest that biases toward diverse groups are more easily mitigated when data are open-sourced, multiple stakeholders are engaged, and during the algorithm's preprocessing stage. Further empirical studies that include a broader range of groups, such as Indigenous peoples in Canada, are needed to validate and expand upon these findings.\nOSF Registry osf.io/9ngz5/; https://osf.io/9ngz5/.\nRR2-10.2196/46684.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome. Accurate risk stratification and early diagnosis of HF are challenging as its signs and symptoms are non-specific. We propose to address this global challenge by developing the STRATIFYHF artificial intelligence-driven decision support system (DSS), which uses novel analytical methods in determining the risk, diagnosis and prognosis of HF. The primary aim of the present study is to collect prospective clinical data to validate the STRATIFYHF DSS (in terms of diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) as a tool to predict the risk, diagnosis and progression of HF. The secondary outcomes are the demographic and clinical predictors of risk, diagnosis and progression of HF.\nSTRATIFYHF is a prospective, multicentre, longitudinal study that will recruit up to 1600 individuals (n=800 suspected/at risk of HF and n=800 diagnosed with HF) aged \u226545 years old, with up to 24 months of follow-up observations. Individuals suspected of HF will be divided into two categories based on current definitions and predefined inclusion criteria. All participants will have their medical history recorded, along with data on physical examination (signs and symptoms), blood tests including serum natriuretic peptides levels, ECG and echocardiogram results, as well as demographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle data, and use of complete novel technologies (cardiac output response to stress test and voice recognition biomarkers). All measurements will be recorded at baseline and at 12-month follow-up, with medical history and hospitalisation also recorded at 24-month follow-up. Cardiovascular MRI assessment will be completed in a subset of participants (n=20-40) from eligible clinical centres only at baseline. Each clinical centre will recruit a subset of participants (n=30) who will complete a 6-month home-based monitoring of clinical characteristics and accelerometry (wrist-worn monitor) to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the STRATIFYHF mobile application. Focus groups and semistructured interviews will be conducted with up to 15 healthcare professionals and up to 20 study participants (10 at risk of HF and 10 diagnosed with HF) to explore the needs of patients and healthcare professionals prior to the development of the STRATIFYHF DSS and to evaluate the acceptability of this mobile application.\nEthical approval has been granted by the East Midlands - Leicester Central Research Ethics Committee (24/EM/0101). Dissemination activities will include journal publications and presentations at conferences, as well as development of training materials and delivery of focused training on the STRATIFYHF DSS and mobile application. We will develop and propose policy guidelines for integration of the STRATIFYHF DSS and mobile application into the standard of care in the HF care pathway.\nNCT06377319.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence-driven clinical decision support systems (AI-CDSSs) are pivotal tools for doctors to improve diagnostic and treatment processes, as well as improve the efficiency and quality of health care services. However, not all doctors trust artificial intelligence (AI) technology, and many remain skeptical and unwilling to adopt these systems.\nThis study aimed to explore in depth the factors influencing doctors' willingness to adopt AI-CDSSs and assess the causal relationships among these factors to gain a better understanding for promoting the clinical application and widespread implementation of these systems.\nBased on the unified\u00a0theory\u00a0of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, we have proposed and designed a framework for doctors' willingness to adopt AI-CDSSs. We conducted a nationwide questionnaire survey in China and performed fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to explore the willingness of doctors to adopt AI-CDSSs in different types of medical institutions and assess the factors influencing their willingness.\nThe survey was administered to doctors working in tertiary hospitals and primary/secondary hospitals across China. We received 450 valid responses out of 578 questionnaires distributed, indicating a robust response rate of 77.9%. Our analysis of the influencing factors and adoption pathways revealed that doctors in tertiary hospitals exhibited 6 distinct pathways for AI-CDSS adoption, which were centered on technology-driven pathways, individual-driven pathways, and technology-individual dual-driven pathways. Doctors in primary/secondary hospitals demonstrated 3 adoption pathways, which were centered on technology-individual and organization-individual dual-driven pathways. There were commonalities in the factors influencing adoption across different medical institutions, such as the positive perception of AI technology's utility and individual readiness to try new technologies. There were also variations in the influence of facilitating conditions among doctors at different medical institutions, especially primary/secondary hospitals.\nFrom the perspective of the 6 pathways for doctors at tertiary hospitals and the 3 pathways for doctors at primary/secondary hospitals, performance expectancy and personal innovativeness were 2 indispensable and core conditions in the pathways to achieving favorable willingness to adopt AI-CDSSs.",

    "abstract": "With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), medicine has entered the era of intelligent medicine, and various aspects, such as medical education and talent cultivation, are also being redefined. The cultivation of clinical thinking abilities poses a formidable challenge even for seasoned clinical educators, as offline training modalities often fall short in bridging the divide between current practice and the desired ideal. Consequently, there arises an imperative need for the expeditious development of a web-based database, tailored to empower physicians in their quest to learn and hone their clinical reasoning skills.\nThis study aimed to introduce an app named \"XueYiKu,\" which includes consultations, physical examinations, auxiliary examinations, and diagnosis, incorporating AI and actual complete hospital medical records to build an online-learning platform using human-computer interaction.\nThe \"XueYiKu\" app was designed as a contactless, self-service, trial-and-error system application based on actual complete hospital medical records and natural language processing technology to comprehensively assess the \"clinical competence\" of residents at different stages. Case extraction was performed at a hospital's case data center, and the best-matching cases were differentiated through natural language processing, word segmentation, synonym conversion, and sorting. More than 400 teaching cases covering 65 kinds of diseases were released for students to learn, and the subjects covered internal medicine, surgery, gynecology and obstetrics, and pediatrics. The difficulty of learning cases was divided into four levels in ascending order. Moreover, the learning and teaching effects were evaluated using 6 dimensions covering systematicness, agility, logic, knowledge expansion, multidimensional evaluation indicators, and preciseness.\nFrom the app's first launch on the Android platform in May 2019 to the last version updated in May 2023, the total number of teacher and student users was 6209 and 1180, respectively. The top 3 subjects most frequently learned were respirology (n=606, 24.1%), general surgery (n=506, 20.1%), and urinary surgery (n=390, 15.5%). For diseases, pneumonia was the most frequently learned, followed by cholecystolithiasis (n=216, 14.1%), benign prostate hyperplasia (n=196, 12.8%), and bladder tumor (n=193, 12.6%). Among 479 students, roughly a third (n=168, 35.1%) scored in the 60 to 80 range, and half of them scored over 80 points (n=238, 49.7%). The app enabled medical students' learning to become more active and self-motivated, with a variety of formats, and provided real-time feedback through assessments on the platform. The learning effect was satisfactory overall and provided important precedence for establishing scientific models and methods for assessing clinical thinking skills in the future.\nThe integration of AI and medical education will undoubtedly assist in the restructuring of education processes; promote the evolution of the education ecosystem; and provide new convenient ways for independent learning, interactive communication, and educational resource sharing.",

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of cleft lip and palate (CLP) requires a multiplane examination, demanding high technical proficiency from radiologists. Therefore, this study aims to develop and validate the first artificial intelligence (AI)-based model (CLP-Net) for fully automated multi-plane localization in three-dimensional(3D) ultrasound during the first trimester.\nThis retrospective study included 418 (394 normal, 24 CLP) 3D ultrasound from 288 pregnant woman between July 2022 to October 2024 from Shenzhen Guangming District People's Hospital during the 11-13\nIn normal test set, mean angle(\u00b1\u2009SD)\u00b0 and distance(\u00b1\u2009SD)mm differences were 6.24\u2009\u00b1\u20094.83, 9.81\u2009\u00b1\u20095.48, 15.36\u2009\u00b1\u200918.14 and 0.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.72, 1.36\u2009\u00b1\u20091.15, 1.96\u2009\u00b1\u20092.35 for MSP\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, RTP\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and MAP\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, NCC and SSIM were 0.931\u2009\u00b1\u20090.079, 0.819\u2009\u00b1\u20090.122, 0.781\u2009\u00b1\u20090.157 and 0.896\u2009\u00b1\u20090.058, 0.785\u2009\u00b1\u20090.076, 0.726\u2009\u00b1\u20090.088 respectively. In the CLP cases, there were 8.61\u2009\u00b1\u20095.52, 10.67\u2009\u00b1\u20095.08, 16.91\u2009\u00b1\u200917.42 and 1.03\u2009\u00b1\u20091.20, 1.17\u2009\u00b1\u20091.08, 1.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.95 for mean angle and distance in MSP, RTP, and MAP, respectively. NCC and SSIM were 0.876\u2009\u00b1\u20090.104, 0.803\u2009\u00b1\u20090.084, 0.793\u2009\u00b1\u20090.089 and 0.841\u2009\u00b1\u20090.105, 0.812\u2009\u00b1\u20090.085, 0.764\u2009\u00b1\u20090.100, respectively. CLP-Net predictions had a highly visual acceptance rate among radiologists (MSP: 95%, RTP: 70%, MAP: 70%), with improved localization speed 15s(31.3%) for senior radiologists and 63s(38.9%) for junior radiologists.\nCLP-Net accurately locates three planes for CLP screening, aiding radiologists and enhancing the efficiency of ultrasound examinations.",

    "abstract": "Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into public health education represents a pivotal advancement in medical knowledge dissemination, particularly for chronic diseases such as asthma. This study assesses the accuracy and comprehensiveness of ChatGPT, a conversational AI model, in providing asthma-related information.\nEmploying a rigorous mixed-methods approach, healthcare professionals evaluated ChatGPT's responses to the Asthma General Knowledge Questionnaire for Adults (AGKQA), a standardized instrument covering various asthma-related topics. Responses were graded for accuracy and completeness and analyzed using statistical tests to assess reproducibility and consistency.\nChatGPT showed notable proficiency in conveying asthma knowledge, with flawless success in the etiology and pathophysiology categories and substantial accuracy in medication information (70%). However, limitations were noted in medication-related responses, where mixed accuracy (30%) highlights the need for further refinement of ChatGPT's capabilities to ensure reliability in critical areas of asthma education. Reproducibility analysis demonstrated a consistent 100% rate across all categories, affirming ChatGPT's reliability in delivering uniform information. Statistical analyses further underscored ChatGPT's stability and reliability.\nThese findings underscore ChatGPT's promise as a valuable educational tool for asthma while emphasizing the necessity of ongoing improvements to address observed limitations, particularly regarding medication-related information.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) beginning to integrate in healthcare, is ushering in a transformative era, impacting diagnostics, altering personalized treatment, and significantly improving operational efficiency. The study aims to describe AI in healthcare, including important technologies like robotics, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP), and to investigate how these technologies are used in patient interaction, predictive analytics, and remote monitoring. The goal of this review is to present a thorough analysis of AI's effects on healthcare while providing stakeholders with a road map for navigating this changing environment.\nThis review analyzes the impact of AI on healthcare using data from the Web of Science (2014-2024), focusing on keywords like AI, ML, and healthcare applications. It examines the uses and effects of AI on healthcare by synthesizing recent literature and real-world case studies, such as Google Health and IBM Watson Health, highlighting AI technologies, their useful applications, and the difficulties in putting them into practice, including problems with data security and resource limitations. The review also discusses new developments in AI, and how they can affect society.\nThe findings demonstrate how AI is enhancing the skills of medical professionals, enhancing diagnosis, and opening the door to more individualized treatment plans, as reflected in the steady rise of AI-related healthcare publications from 158 articles (3.54%) in 2014 to 731 articles (16.33%) by 2024. Core applications like remote monitoring and predictive analytics improve operational effectiveness and patient involvement. However, there are major obstacles to the mainstream implementation of AI in healthcare, including issues with data security and budget constraints.\nHealthcare may be transformed by AI, but its successful use requires ethical and responsible use. To meet the changing demands of the healthcare sector and guarantee the responsible application of AI technologies, the evaluation highlights the necessity of ongoing research, instruction, and multidisciplinary cooperation. In the future, integrating AI responsibly will be essential to optimizing its advantages and reducing related dangers.",

    "abstract": "Ambient artificial intelligence offers promise for improving documentation efficiency and reducing provider burden through clinical note generation. However, challenges persist in workflow integration, compliance, and widespread adoption. This study leveraged a Learning Health System (LHS) framework to align research and operations using a hybrid effectiveness-implementation protocol, embedded as pragmatic trial operations within the electronic health record (EHR).\nAn alpha phase was conducted to pilot technical integration, refine workflows, and determine sample size in planning for a beta phase designed as a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index (PFI) as primary outcome. During alpha, bi-directional governance was established between IS operations and LHS team with multidisciplinary workgroups for analytics, technical, documentation, and user experience. Ambient AI was embedded into the EHR using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), with real-time data dashboards tracking utilization and documentation accuracy for operations and research. Performance metrics were monitored serially using a difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis to detect drift caused by software workflow changes.\nThe alpha phase, designed as Type 1 Hybrid, informed a 24-week beta phase stepped-wedge trial with 90% power to detect changes in PFI. Across the alpha phase, the weighted median of average provider Ambient AI utilization was 65.4% following Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles addressing organizational feasibility and task-dependent adoption. Diagnosis code accuracy dropped from 79% to 35% (p < 0.01) during alpha but recovered with a new note template and provider training. DiD did not detect significant drifts in work outside of work or time in notes two weeks before and after the new note template. Beta phase enrollment achieved its targeted 66 providers across eight specialties, initiating on schedule.\nWe provide a novel playbook for integrating Generative AI platforms in healthcare, combining pragmatic trial operations, human-centered design, and real-time monitoring to advance evidence-based implementation.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) falls within the spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating diseases that may lead to permanent neurological disability. Fundamental to the diagnosis and clinical surveillance is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that allows for the identification of T2-hyperintensities associated with autoimmune injury that demonstrate distinct spatial distribution patterns. Here, we describe the clinical experience of a 31-year-old, right-handed, White man seen in consultation at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, following complaints of headaches that began after head trauma related to military service. Imaging data spanning over 10\u00a0years are provided. All MRI data are currently presented in black and white with grayscale values within voxels associated with a single variable, intensity. We transformed these grayscale values into color using generative artificial intelligence (AI). As color allows for the inclusion of three variables: hue, lightness (intensity), and saturation, we hypothesized that additional details may be learned beyond those currently provided with the existing conventional approach of grayscale interpretation. We identified differences in lesion colors that remained consistent from the two MRI timepoints studied. In addition, quantitative R1, R2, and proton density voxel values appeared consistent with the color scheme generated by the AI system. With advancing AI methods and capabilities along with the additional data that color provides in comparison to grayscale, new insights into the biology of disease may be possible. Modifying what we measure in people with chronic conditions and how we present the data may be of greater value than conventional approaches typically used in the study, education, and care of people with MS and other neurological conditions.\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune condition involving the brain and spinal cord that may result in permanent neurological disability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are used both in the diagnosis and surveillance of people with MS. Current MRI data appear black and white in appearance and grayscale values within voxels comprise the images that are seen. However, grayscale values are associated with a single variable, intensity. On the other hand, color is associated with three variables: hue, lightness (intensity), and saturation. Overall, grayscale images are less dynamic and, more importantly, they may exclude existing details. We hypothesized that the transformation from grayscale MRI data to color may provide additional information related to lesions resulting from MS. We were able to identify color differences in lesions when evaluating MRI images from a single subject. These color changes appeared to remain consistent over the course of 10\u00a0years. Quantitative MRI values also suggested a relationship between degree of brain injury within lesions by color. With advancing artificial intelligence methods and capabilities along with the addition of color information, more could be learned about the biology of MS. The information provided here suggests that the use of color may have value in neuroimaging. Adjusting what we measure for those within chronic conditions and how the information is presented may be of greater value than current practices and may enhance the study, education, and delivery of care for those with chronic neurological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease is characterised by the progressive loss of kidney function. However, predicting who will progress to kidney failure is difficult. Artificial Intelligence, including Machine Learning, shows promise in this area. This narrative review highlights the most common and important variables used in machine learning models to predict progressive chronic kidney disease. Ovid Medline and EMBASE were searched in August 2023 with keywords relating to 'chronic kidney disease', 'machine learning', and 'end-stage renal disease'. Studies were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria and excluded if variables inputted into machine learning models were not discussed. Data extraction focused on specific variables inputted into the machine learning models. After screening of 595 articles, 16 were included in the review. The most utilised machine learning models were random forest, support vector machines and XGBoost. The most commonly occurring variables were age, gender, measures of renal function, measures of proteinuria, and full blood examination. Only half of all studies included clinical variables in their models. The most important variables overall were measures of renal function, measures of proteinuria, age, full blood examination and serum albumin. Machine learning was consistently superior or non-inferior when compared to the Kidney Failure Risk Equation. This review identified key variables used in machine learning models to predict chronic kidney disease progression to kidney failure. These findings lay the foundations for the development of future machine learning models capable of rivalling the Kidney Failure Risk Equation in the provision of accurate kidney failure prediction.",

    "abstract": "Devices that help educate young doctors and enable safe, minimally invasive surgery are needed. Eureka is a surgical artificial intelligence (AI) system that can intraoperatively highlight loose connective tissues (LCTs) in the dissected layers and nerves in the surgical field displayed on a monitor. In this study, we examined whether AI navigation (AIN) with Eureka can assist trainees in recognizing nerves during colorectal surgery.\nIn left-sided colorectal surgery (n\u2009=\u200951, between\u00a0July 2023 and February 2024), Eureka was connected to the laparoscopic system side by side, and the nerve was highlighted on the monitor during the surgery. We examined the rate of failure to recognize nerves by trainee surgeons over a total of 101 scenarios after it was recognized intraoperatively by the supervising surgeon (certified by the Japanese Society of Endoscopic Surgery). We also examined the frequency of nerve recognition by the trainee physicians viewing the Eureka monitor when recognition was not possible (recognition assistance rate).\nThe nerve recognition failure rate and recognition assistance rate with AIN were as follows: right hypogastric nerve during sigmoid colon mobilization, 44/101 (43.6%) and 19/44 (43.2%); left hypogastric nerves during dissection of the dorsal rectum, 27/101 (26.7%) and 13/27 (48.1%); right lumbar splanchnic nerves, 32/101 (31.7%) and 29/32 (90.6%); left lumbar splanchnic nerves, 44/101 (43.6%) and 39/44 (88.6%); and pelvic visceral nerves during dissection of the dorsal rectum, 29/45 (64.4%) and 6/29 (20.7%), respectively.\nAlthough the rate of recognition with assistance from AIN differed for the different nerves, this system can potentially assist in anatomic recognition, enhance surgical education, and contribute to nerve preservation.\nImprovement of AI navigation in minimally invasive surgery and examination of its intraoperative support and educational effectiveness.

    "abstract": "The ability to non-invasively measure left atrial pressure would facilitate the identification of patients at risk of pulmonary congestion and guide proactive heart failure care. Wearable cardiac monitors, which record single-lead electrocardiogram data, provide information that can be leveraged to infer left atrial pressures.\nWe developed a deep neural network using single-lead electrocardiogram data to determine when the left atrial pressure is elevated. The model was developed and internally evaluated using a cohort of 6739 samples from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and externally validated on a cohort of 4620 samples from a second institution. We then evaluated model on patch-monitor electrocardiographic data on a small prospective cohort.\nThe model achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 for detecting elevated left atrial pressures on an internal holdout dataset from MGH and 0.76 on an external validation set from a second institution. A further prospective dataset was obtained using single-lead electrocardiogram data with a patch-monitor from patients who underwent right heart catheterization at MGH. Evaluation of the model on this dataset yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.875 for identifying elevated left atrial pressures for electrocardiogram signals acquired close to the time of the right heart catheterization procedure.\nThese results demonstrate the utility and the potential of ambulatory cardiac hemodynamic monitoring with electrocardiogram patch-monitors.\nHeart failure is a common disorder that is challenging to manage. Appearance of symptoms can be subtle and dangerous and there are few tools for clinicians to estimate when a patient is likely to experience an episode of heart failure. Current methods to detect elevated pressure in the heart (one sign of oncoming failure) are invasive and can only be performed in an inpatient setting. A non-invasive, quick method for detecting higher heart pressure would be helpful for identifying worsening heart failure in the home environment. For this reason, we developed a computer method to detect elevated pressures inside the heart using a non-invasive signal from a wearable patch monitor device, the electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG). Our results show our method provides a reliable, non-invasive way to measure heart pressures using data that can be obtained in the outpatient setting.",

    "abstract": "A scoping review was conducted to investigate the role of radiological imaging, particularly high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosing and prognosticating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Relevant studies from the PubMed database were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two reviewers assessed study quality and analyzed data, estimating heterogeneity and publication bias. The analysis primarily focused on deep learning approaches for feature extraction from HRCT images, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Radiomics, utilizing quantitative features extracted from images, were computed using various tools to improve precision in analysis. Validation methods such as k-fold cross-validation were employed to assess model robustness and generalizability. Findings revealed that radiologic patterns in interstitial lung disease hold prognostic significance for patient survival. However, the additional prognostic value of quantitative assessment of fibrosis extent remains uncertain. IPF poses a substantial challenge in respiratory medicine, necessitating advanced diagnostic and prognostic tools. Radiomics emerges as a valuable asset, offering insights into disease characteristics and aiding in disease classification. It contributes to understanding underlying pathophysiological processes, facilitating more effective management of pulmonary disorders. Future research should focus on clarifying the additional prognostic value of quantitative assessment and further refining AI-based diagnostic and prognostic models for IPF.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, access to large-scale bilingual parallel data has become more efficient, thereby accelerating the development and application of machine translation. Given the increasing cultural exchanges between China and Japan, many scholars have begun to study the Chinese translation of Japanese waka poetry. Based on this, the study first explores the structure of waka and the current state of its Chinese translations, analyzing existing translation disputes and introducing a data collection method for waka using IoT. Then, an optimized neural machine translation model is proposed, which integrates a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network, vertical Tree-LSTM, and an attention mechanism into the Transformer framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the three optimized models-Transformer\u2009+\u2009Bi-LSTM, Transformer\u2009+\u2009Tree-LSTM, and Transformer\u2009+\u2009Tree-LSTM\u2009+\u2009Attention-outperform the baseline Transformer model on both public and waka datasets. The BLEU scores of the models on the public dataset were 23.71, 23.95, and 24.12, respectively. Notably, on the waka dataset, the Transformer\u2009+\u2009Tree-LSTM\u2009+\u2009Attention model achieved the highest BLEU score of 20.65, demonstrating a significant advantage in capturing waka's unique features and contextual information. This study offers new methods to enhance the quality of Chinese-Japanese translation, promoting cultural exchange and understanding.",

The study aims to understand how the use of AIGC tools, which has become more frequent among those with lower research self-efficacy, affects anxiety and research resilience. Additionally, the research explores the role of the mentoring relationship in influencing the psychological and academic experiences of female graduate students.\nThe research involved 1164 female master's and doctoral students and employed a moderated chain mediation model. This model was constructed based on social cognitive theory and Habermas interaction theory to analyze the relationships between research self-efficacy, mobile phone dependence, anxiety, and research resilience. Data was collected and empirically analyzed using SPSS 26.0, a statistical software, to examine the proposed relationships and the moderating effect of the mentoring relationship.\nThe findings revealed that scientific research self-efficacy positively influences research resilience among female graduate students. Additionally, mobile phone dependence and anxiety were found to play a chain mediating role between self-efficacy and research resilience. The study also discovered that the mentoring relationship negatively moderated the effects of mobile phone dependence and anxiety on these students.\nBased on the results, the study concludes that mentors and academic administrators should consider the research capabilities and interests of students when assigning research tasks. It is recommended to establish a flight instructor mentorship system that maximizes the strengths of each mentor to support students, especially those with suboptimal mentor-mentee relationships. This approach could help in providing positive guidance and improving the research resilience of female graduate students who are more susceptible to anxiety and mobile phone dependence.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the use of machine learning (ML) models to predict the biodistribution of nanoparticles in various organs, using a dataset derived from research on nanoparticle behavior for cancer treatment. The dataset includes both categorical and numerical variables related to nanoparticle properties, with a focus on their distribution across organs such as the tumor, heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney tissues. In order to address the complex and non-linear nature of the data, three machine learning models were utilized: Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR), Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The selection of these models was based on their wide range of capabilities in dealing with non-linear relationships and data complexity. To further model performance and strength, the study also applied cutting-edge methods including the Firefly Algorithm for hyperparameter tuning and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection. Based on higher R\u00b2 and lower RMSE values for most output parameters, the study concluded that Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) did better compared to other models in predicting biodistribution outcomes. The study revealed that machine learning models, particularly KRR, exhibit a high level of efficiency in accurately representing the non-linear characteristics of nanoparticle biodistribution. The results obtained provide valuable insights into the optimization of predictive models for the behavior of nanoparticles. These models can be further enhanced by the use of advanced feature selection and hyperparameter tuning techniques.",

    "abstract": "In clinical practice, differentiating among pulmonary mucormycosis (PM), invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) can be challenging. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of chest CT-based artificial intelligence (AI) models in distinguishing among these three diseases. Patients with confirmed PM, IPA, or PTB were retrospectively recruited from three tertiary hospitals. Two models were developed: unanotated supervised training (UST) model trained with original CT images and annotated supervised training (AST) model trained with manually annotated lesion images. A network questionnaire with 20 cases was designed to assess the performance of clinicians. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated for both models and clinicians. A total of 61 PM cases, 136 IPA cases, and 155 PTB cases were included in the study. In the internal validation set, both models had an accuracy of 66.1%. The UST model had sensitivities of 27.3%, 73.9%, and 76.0% for PM, IPA, and PTB, while AST model had sensitivities of 9.1%, 69.6%, and 88.0% for the same conditions. In the external validation set, both models had an accuracy of 57.6%. The UST model had sensitivities of 0, 85.7%, and 53.3% for PM, IPA, and PTB, respectively, while AST model had sensitivities of 0, 42.9% and 83.3%. 112 clinicians had an accuracy of 42.9%, with sensitivities of 31.5%, 43.4%, and 48.0% for PM, IPA, and PTB. We demonstrated that two AI models showed comparable performance in diagnosing three diseases. Both models achieved acceptable sensitivity in detecting IPA and PTB, but had low sensitivity in identifying PM.\nThis study assessed two AI models' ability to distinguish between three lung infections using chest CT scans. Both models showed good sensitivity for detecting invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and pulmonary tuberculosis but struggled with identifying pulmonary mucormycosis.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) tools for histological diagnosis offer great potential to healthcare, yet failure to understand their clinical context is delaying adoption. IGUANA (Interpretable Gland-Graphs using a Neural Aggregator) is an AI algorithm that can effectively classify colonic biopsies into normal versus abnormal categories, designed to automatically report normal cases. We performed a retrospective pathological and clinical review of the errors made by IGUANA.\nFalse negative (FN) errors were the primary focus due to the greatest propensity for harm. Pathological evaluation involved assessment of whole slide image (WSI) quality, precise diagnoses for each missed entity and identification of factors impeding diagnosis. Clinical evaluation scored the impact of each error on the patient and detailed the type of impact in terms of missed diagnosis, investigations or treatment.\nAcross 5054 WSIs from 2080 UK National Health Service patients there were 220 FN errors across 164 cases (4.4% of WSI, 7.9% of cases). Diagnostic errors varied from cases of adenocarcinoma to mild inflammation. 88.4% of FN errors would have no impact on patient care, with only one error causing major patient harm. Factors that protected against harm included biopsies being low-risk polyps or diagnostic features were detected in other biopsies.\nMost FN errors would not result in patient harm, suggesting that even with a 7.9% case-level error rate, this AI tool might be more suitable for adoption than statistics portray. Consideration of the clinical context of AI tool errors is essential to facilitate safe implementation.",

Healthcare organizations are now starting to establish management strategies for integrating such platforms (AI-ML toolsets) which leverage the computational power of advanced algorithms to analyze data and to provide better insights which ultimately translates to enhanced clinical decision-making and improved patient outcomes. Emerging AI-ML platforms and trends in pathology and medicine are reshaping the field by offering innovative solutions to enhance diagnostic accuracy, operational workflows, clinical decision support, and clinical outcomes. These tools are also increasingly valuable in pathology research where they contribute to automated image analysis, biomarker discovery, drug development, clinical trials, and productive analytics. Other related trends include the adoption of ML-Ops (Machine Learning Operations) for managing models in clinical settings, the application of multimodal and multi-agent AI to utilize diverse data sources, expedited translational research and virtualized education for training and simulation. As the final chapter of our AI educational series, this review article delves into the current adoption, future directions, and transformative potential of AI-ML platforms in pathology and medicine, discussing their applications, benefits, challenges, and future perspectives.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic emergent disease multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) following coronavirus disease-19 infection can mimic endemic typhus. We aimed to use artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a clinical decision support system that accurately distinguishes MIS-C versus Endemic Typhus (MET).\nDemographic, clinical, and laboratory features rapidly available following presentation were extracted for 133 patients with MIS-C and 87 patients hospitalized due to typhus. An attention module assigned importance to inputs used to create the two-phase AI-MET. Phase 1 uses 17 features to arrive at a classification manually (MET-17). If the confidence level is not surpassed, 13 additional features are added to calculate MET-30 using a recurrent neural network.\nWhile 24 of 30 features differed statistically, the values overlapped sufficiently that the features were clinically irrelevant distinguishers as individual parameters. However, AI-MET successfully classified typhus and MIS-C with 100% accuracy. A validation cohort of 111 additional patients with MIS-C was classified with 99% accuracy.\nArtificial intelligence can successfully distinguish MIS-C from typhus using rapidly available features. This decision support system will be a valuable tool for front-line providers facing the difficulty of diagnosing a febrile child in endemic areas.",

    "abstract": "Evaluate the accuracy and reliability of various generative artificial intelligence (AI) models (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, T5, Llama-2, Mistral-Large, and Claude-3 Opus) in predicting Emergency Severity Index (ESI) levels for pediatric emergency department patients and assess the impact of medically oriented fine-tuning.\nSeventy pediatric clinical vignettes from the ESI Handbook version 4 were used as the gold standard. Each AI model predicted the ESI level for each vignette. Performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, were calculated. Reliability was assessed by repeating the tests and measuring the interrater reliability using Fleiss kappa. Paired t tests were used to compare the models before and after fine-tuning.\nClaude-3 Opus achieved the highest performance amongst the untrained models with a sensitivity of 80.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 63.6-90.7), specificity of 91.3% (95% CI: 83.8-99), and an F1 score of 73.9% (95% CI: 58.9-90.7). After fine-tuning, the GPT-4.0 model showed statistically significant improvement with a sensitivity of 77.1% (95% CI: 60.1-86.5), specificity of 92.5% (95% CI: 89.5-97.4), and an F1 score of 74.6% (95% CI: 63.9-83.8, P < 0.04). Reliability analysis revealed high agreement for Claude-3 Opus (Fleiss \u03ba: 0.85), followed by Mistral-Large (Fleiss \u03ba: 0.79) and trained GPT-4.0 (Fleiss \u03ba: 0.67). Training improved the reliability of GPT models (P < 0.001).\nGenerative AI models demonstrate promising accuracy in predicting pediatric ESI levels, with fine-tuning significantly enhancing their performance and reliability. These findings suggest that AI could serve as a valuable tool in pediatric triage.",

    "abstract": "Effective evaluation and governance of predictive models used in health care, particularly those driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, are needed to ensure that models are fair, appropriate, valid, effective, and safe, or FAVES. We analyzed data from the 2023 American Hospital Association Annual Survey Information Technology Supplement to identify how AI and predictive models are used and evaluated for accuracy and bias in hospitals. Hospitals use AI and predictive models to predict health trajectories or risks for inpatients, identify high-risk outpatients to inform follow-up care, monitor health, recommend treatments, simplify or automate billing procedures, and facilitate scheduling. We found that 65\u00a0percent of US hospitals used predictive models, and 79\u00a0percent of those used models from their electronic health record developer. Sixty-one percent of hospitals that used models evaluated them for accuracy using data from their health system (local evaluation), but only 44\u00a0percent reported local evaluation for bias. Hospitals that developed their own predictive models, had high operating margins, and were health system members were more likely to report local evaluation. Policy and programs that provide technical support, tools to assess FAVES principles, and educational resources would help ensure that all hospitals can use predictive models safely and prevent a new organizational digital divide in AI.",

    "abstract": "As in many other sectors, artificial intelligence has an impact on health. Artificial intelligence anxiety may occur because of a lack of knowledge about the effects of artificial intelligence, its outcomes, and how it will be used, as well as potential labor concerns. This study aims to determine the artificial intelligence anxiety levels of nursing students and examine whether there is a relationship with their self-efficacy levels. This cross-sectional study, conducted at a public nursing school in Turkey, involved 317 nursing students. Data were collected using a personal information form, the General Self-efficacy Scale, and the Artificial Intelligence Anxiety Scale. There was a negative, moderately strong correlation between the General Self-efficacy Scale and the learning subdimension (r = -0.369) and the Artificial Intelligence Anxiety Scale (r = -0.313) and a weak negative correlation between the job replacement subdimension (r = -0.215), sociotechnical blindness subdimension (r = -0.232), and artificial intelligence configuration subdimension (r = -0.211). The General Self-efficacy Scale has a significant negative effect on the Artificial Intelligence Anxiety Scale (\u03b2 = -.313, t = -5.845, P < .05). These findings suggest that higher self-efficacy is associated with lower artificial intelligence anxiety. It is recommended to enhance technical competence and self-efficacy in nursing education.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence into medicine has attracted increasing attention in recent years. ChatGPT has emerged as a promising tool for delivering evidence-based recommendations in various clinical domains. However, the application of ChatGPT to physical therapy for musculoskeletal conditions has yet to be investigated.\nThirty clinical questions related to spinal, lower extremity, and upper extremity conditions were quired to ChatGPT-4. Responses were assessed for accuracy against clinical practice guidelines by two reviewers. Intra- and inter-rater reliability were measured using Fleiss' kappa (k).\nChatGPT's responses were consistent with CPG recommendations for 80% of the questions. Performance was highest for upper extremity conditions (100%) and lowest for spinal conditions (60%), with a moderate performance for lower extremity conditions (87%). Intra-rater reliability was good (k\u2009=\u20090.698 and k\u2009=\u20090.631 for the two reviewers), and inter-rater reliability was very good (k\u2009=\u20090.847).\nChatGPT demonstrates promise as a supplementary decision-making support tool for physical therapy, with good accuracy and reliability in aligning with clinical practice guideline recommendations. Further research is needed to evaluate its performance across broader scenarios and refine its clinical applicability.",

    "abstract": "Although the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medicine and healthcare holds transformative potential, significant challenges must be necessarily addressed. This technological innovation requires a commitment to ethical principles. Key issues concern autonomy, reliability, and bias. Furthermore, AI development must guarantee rigorous data privacy and security standards. Effective AI implementation demands thorough validation, transparency, and the involvement of multidisciplinary teams to oversee ethical considerations. These issues also concern pain medicine where careful assessment of subjective experiences and individualized care are crucial. Notably, in this rapidly evolving technological landscape, politics plays a pivotal role in establishing rules and regulations. Regulatory frameworks, such as the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act and recent U.S. executive orders, provide essential guidelines for the responsible use of AI. This step is crucial for balancing innovation with rigorous ethical standards, ultimately leveraging the incredible AI's benefits. As the field evolves rapidly and concepts like algorethics and data ethics become more widespread, the scientific community is increasingly recognizing the need for specialists in this area, such as AI Ethics Specialists.",

    "abstract": "Though simple in its fundamental mechanism - a critical disruption of local blood supply - stroke is complicated by the intricate nature of the neural substrate, the neurovascular architecture, and their complex interactions in generating its clinical manifestations. This complexity is adequately described by high-resolution imaging with sensitivity not only to parenchymal macrostructure but also microstructure and functional tissue properties, in conjunction with detailed characterization of vascular topology and dynamics. Such descriptive richness mandates models of commensurate complexity only artificial intelligence could plausibly deliver, if we are to achieve the goal of individually precise, personalized care.\nAdvances in machine vision technology, especially deep learning, are delivering higher fidelity predictive, descriptive, and inferential tools, incorporating increasingly rich imaging information within ever more flexible models. Impact at the clinical front line remains modest, however, owing to the challenges of delivering models robust to the noisy, incomplete, biased, and comparatively small-scale data characteristic of real-world practice.\nThe potential benefit of introducing AI to stroke, in imaging and elsewhere, is now unquestionable, but the optimal approach - and the path to real-world application - remain unsettled. Deep generative models offer a compelling solution to current obstacles and are predicted powerfully to catalyse innovation in the field.",

    "abstract": "The continuous integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical settings requires the development of up-to-date and robust guidelines and standard frameworks that consider the evolving challenges of AI implementation in medicine. This review evaluates the quality of these guideline and summarizes ethical frameworks, best practices, and recommendations.\nThe Appraisal of Guidelines, Research, and Evaluation II tool was used to assess the quality of guidelines based on 6 domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. The protocol of this review including the eligibility criteria, the search strategy data extraction sheet and methods, was published prior to the actual review with International Registered Report Identifier of DERR1-10.2196/47105.\nThe initial search resulted in 4975 studies from 2 databases and 7 studies from manual search. Eleven articles were selected for data extraction based on the eligibility criteria. We found that while guidelines generally excel in scope, purpose, and editorial independence, there is significant variability in applicability and the rigor of guideline development. Well-established initiatives such as TRIPOD+AI, DECIDE-AI, SPIRIT-AI, and CONSORT-AI have shown high quality, particularly in terms of stakeholder involvement. However, applicability remains a prominent challenge among the guidelines. The result also showed that the reproducibility, ethical, and environmental aspects of AI in medicine still need attention from both medical and AI communities.\nOur work highlights the need for working toward the development of integrated and comprehensive reporting guidelines that adhere to the principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability. This alignment is essential for fostering a cultural shift toward transparency and open science, which are pivotal milestone for sustainable digital health research.\nThis review evaluates the current reporting guidelines, discussing their advantages as well as challenges and limitations.",

    "results": "The initial search resulted in 4975 studies from 2 databases and 7 studies from manual search. Eleven articles were selected for data extraction based on the eligibility criteria. We found that while guidelines generally excel in scope, purpose, and editorial independence, there is significant variability in applicability and the rigor of guideline development. Well-established initiatives such as TRIPOD+AI, DECIDE-AI, SPIRIT-AI, and CONSORT-AI have shown high quality, particularly in terms of stakeholder involvement. However, applicability remains a prominent challenge among the guidelines. The result also showed that the reproducibility, ethical, and environmental aspects of AI in medicine still need attention from both medical and AI communities.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has dramatically improved the prognosis for some cancers but can be associated with myocarditis, adverse cardiovascular events, and mortality.\nThe aim of this study was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict the increased likelihood for the development of ICI-related myocarditis and adverse cardiovascular events.\nCancer patients treated with ICI at a tertiary institution from 2011 to 2022 were reviewed. Baseline characteristics, laboratory values, electrocardiograms, and cardiovascular clinical outcomes were extracted. A composite outcome of ICI-related myocarditis and major adverse cardiovascular events (transient ischemic attack/stroke, new diagnosis of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death) was used to develop a multimodal joint fusion AI model by combining baseline tabular data with electrocardiogram (ECG) in a single end-to-end model. ECG data were parsed using 1-D convolution and tubular data using multilayer perceptron.\nOf 2,258 cancer patients who had ICI therapy and troponin measurement (mean age 68.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.5\u00a0years, 59.7% male), the composite of cardiovascular clinical adverse events, including ICI-related myocarditis and major adverse cardiovascular events, occurred in 264 (11.7%) unique patients, with 428 events overall (including 59 [3%] ICI-related myocarditis events and 59 [3%] cardiac deaths). The proposed joint fusion model outperformed individual ECG and baseline electronic medical record data and laboratory value models with an area under the operating characteristics curve of 0.72 (0.64 true positive rate and 0.98 negative predictive value).\nA multimodal fusion AI model to predict myocarditis and adverse cardiovascular events in cancer patients starting ICI therapy had good prognostic performance. It may have clinical utility in identifying at-risk patients who may benefit from closer surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Our opinion piece pays homage to the evolution of medical practices, tracing back to the era of Hippocrates, through significant historical milestones, and drawing parallels with the principles underpinning foundational artificial intelligence (AI) models. It emphasizes the shared ethos of both domains: a commitment to comprehensive care that values diverse data integration and individualized patient treatment. The excitement surrounding foundation models in medical imaging is understandable. However, a critical and cautious approach is crucial before widespread adoption. By addressing the present 4 major limitations (ie, data bias and generalizability, interpretability of AI models, data scarcity and diversity, and computational resources and infrastructure) and fostering a culture of rigorous research, we can unlock the true potential of these models and revolutionize medical care. This critique (opinion) paper highlights the need for a more measured approach in the field of ",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) as one of the most common cardiovascular diseases has attracted great attention due to its high disability and mortality rate. Thus, a timely and effective recognition method for AF is of great importance for diagnosing and preventing it. Herein, we proposed a novel intelligent sensing and recognition system for AF which combined Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), flexible wearable electronic devices, and artificial intelligence. Experiment and simulation synergistically verified that the flexible pressure sensor arrays designed according to the TCM theory could synchronously obtain the 3D pulses at Cun, Guan, and Chi. Combined with a homemade signal acquisition system and the pulse signals labeled by doctors of cardiovascular diseases, the differences in the 3D pulse signals between ones with AF and without can be picked up clearly. Enabled the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the pulse database, the recognition model was formed with a recognition rate of up to 90%. As a proof of concept, the artificial intelligence-enabled novel atrial fibrillation diagnosis system has been used to detect patients with AF in hospitals, showing 80% recognition rate. This work provides a new strategy to precisely diagnose and remotely treat AF, as well as to accelerate the development of Modern Chinese Medicine treatment.",

    "abstract": "The increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance has prompted a need for more effective antimicrobial stewardship programs (AMS). Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools have emerged as potential solutions to enhance decision-making and improve patient outcomes in AMS. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the impact of AI in AMS and to assess its predictive performance and diagnostic accuracy. We conducted a comprehensive literature search across PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science to identify studies published up to July 2024. Studies included were observational, cohort, or retrospective, focusing on the application of AI/ML in AMS. The outcomes assessed were the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). We calculated the mean pooled effect size (ES) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effects model. The risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-AI tool, and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO. Out of 3,458 retrieved articles, 80 studies met the inclusion criteria. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that ML models exhibited strong predictive performance and diagnostic accuracy, with the following results: AUC [ES: 72.28 (70.42-74.14)], accuracy [ES: 74.97 (73.35-76.58)], sensitivity [ES: 76.89; (71.90-81.89)], specificity [ES: 73.77; (67.87-79.67)], NPV [ES:79.92 (76.54-83.31)], and PPV [ES: 69.41 (60.19-78.63)] across various AMS settings. AI and ML tools offer promising enhancements due to their strong predictive performance. The integration of AI into AMS could lead to more precise antimicrobial prescribing, reduced antimicrobial resistance, and better resource utilization.",

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic exploration (LE) is crucial for diagnosing intra-abdominal metastasis (IAM) in advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, overlooking single, tiny, and occult IAM lesions during LE can severely affect the treatment and prognosis due to surgeons' visual misinterpretations. To address this, we developed the artificial intelligence laparoscopic exploration system (AiLES) to recognize IAM lesions with various metastatic extents and locations. The AiLES was developed based on a dataset consisting of 5111 frames from 100 videos, using 4130 frames for model development and 981 frames for evaluation. The AiLES achieved a Dice score of 0.76 and a recognition speed of 11 frames per second, demonstrating robust performance in different metastatic extents (0.74-0.76) and locations (0.63-0.90). Furthermore, AiLES performed comparably to novice surgeons in IAM recognition and excelled in recognizing tiny and occult lesions. Our results demonstrate that the implementation of AiLES could enhance accurate tumor staging and assist individualized treatment decisions.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) may be used to learn and predict the maxillomandibular relationship, particularly when the number of occluding teeth pairs is insufficient. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of training a new two-stage coarse-to-fine teeth alignment pipeline AI system in predicting maxillomandibular relationships based on the occlusal morphology of antagonistic teeth.\nMaxillary and mandibular stone casts were collected and scanned at the maximal intercuspal position (MIP). A deep learning alignment network was trained using 90% of cast pairs. The remaining 10% of pairs were input into the trained AI system for validation. The maxillomandibular relationships predicted by the AI system were superimposed and compared with those of the mounted casts. Cartesian x-, y-, and z-coordinates were defined for each mandibular tooth scan with respect to (w.r.t.) its occlusal plane and dental midline. The discrepancy in the position of maxillary teeth scans was described based on rotation and translation.\nA total of 325 pairs of maxillary and mandibular stone casts were collected, with 300 pairs used for training and 25 for validation. For the AI-predicted maxillomandibular relationship, the mean rotational discrepancies w.r.t. the x-, y-, and z-axis were 1.407\u00b0\u00b11.548\u00b0, 1.269\u00b0\u00b18.476\u00b0, and 0.730\u00b0\u00b11.334\u00b0, respectively. The mean translational discrepancies w.r.t. the x-, y-, and z-axis were 0.185\u00b11.324 mm, 1.222\u00b10.848 mm, -1.034\u00b10.273 mm, respectively.\nThe AI-predicted maxillomandibular relationship for maxillary and mandibular teeth scans shows discrepancies of less than 1.3 mm and 1.5\u00b0 compared to the actual relationships.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly relevant in various sectors, including higher education. This study investigates the psychosocial factors influencing AI adoption among Peruvian university students and uses an extended UTAUT2 model to examine various constructs that may impact AI acceptance and use.\nThis study employed a quantitative approach with a survey-based design. A total of 482 students from public and private universities in Peru participated in the research. The study utilized partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the data and test the hypothesized relationships between the constructs.\nThe findings revealed that three out of the six hypothesized factors significantly influenced AI adoption among Peruvian university students. Performance expectancy (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.274), social influence (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.355), and AI learning self-efficacy (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.431) were found to have significant positive effects on AI adoption. In contrast to expectations, ethical awareness, perceived playfulness, AI readiness and AI anxiety did not have significant impacts on AI appropriation in this context.\nThis study highlights the importance of practical benefits, the social context, and self-confidence in the adoption of AI within Peruvian higher education. These findings contribute to the understanding of AI adoption in diverse educational settings and provide a framework for developing effective AI implementation strategies in higher education institutions. The results can guide universities and policymakers in creating targeted approaches to enhance AI adoption and integration in academic environments, focusing on demonstrating the practical value of AI, leveraging social networks, and building students' confidence in their ability to learn and use AI technologies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most incapacitating neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). PD is the second most common NDD worldwide which affects approximately 1-2 percent of people over 65 years. It is an attractive pursuit for artificial intelligence (AI) to contribute to and evolve PD treatments through drug repositioning by repurposing existing drugs, shelved drugs, or even candidates that do not meet the criteria for clinical trials. A search was conducted in three databases Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. We reviewed the data related to the last years (1975-present) to identify those drugs currently being proposed for repositioning in PD. Moreover, we reviewed the present status of the computational approach, including AI/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-powered pharmaceutical discovery efforts and their implementation in PD treatment. It was found that the number of drug repositioning studies for PD has increased recently. Repositioning of drugs in PD is taking off, and scientific communities are increasingly interested in communicating its results and finding effective treatment alternatives for PD. A better chance of success in PD drug discovery has been made possible due to AI/ML algorithm advancements. In addition to the experimentation stage of drug discovery, it is also important to leverage AI in the planning stage of clinical trials to make them more effective. New AI-based models or solutions that increase the success rate of drug development are greatly needed.",

    "abstract": "The Adelaide Score is an artificial intelligence system that integrates objective vital signs and laboratory tests to predict likelihood of hospital discharge.\nA prospective implementation trial was conducted at the Lyell McEwin Hospital in South Australia. The Adelaide Score was added to existing human, artificial intelligence, and other technological infrastructure for the first 28\u2009days of April 2024 (intervention), and outcomes were compared using parametric, non-parametric and health economic analyses, to those in the first 28\u2009days of April 2023 (control). Artificial intelligence evaluated inpatients admitted under 18 surgical and medical teams, and patients of high likelihood of discharge were provided, on working shifts between Thursday to Sunday, to the Supportive Weekend Interprofessional Flow Team (SWIFT) comprising a senior nurse and pharmacist.\nTwo thousand nine hundred and sixty-eight admissions were included across intervention and control periods. Relative to the control group, use of the Adelaide Score in the intervention group resulted in significantly shorter median length of stay (3.1 versus 2.9\u2009days, P\u2009=\u20090.028) and significantly lower seven-day readmission rate (7.1 versus 5.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.02). The 0.2 bed-day reduction in median length of stay produced a cost saving of $735\u2009708.60 across the 28-day period, or $9\u2009564\u2009211.80 across a 52-week\u2009year. There was no significant difference between intervention and control groups in median length of stay for patients discharged on weekends, in-hospital mortality, or discharge to non-home destinations.\nThe prospective implementation of the Adelaide Score was associated with improved hospital and cost efficiency, alongside lower readmissions, for patients across surgical and medical services.",

    "abstract": "This review aims to evaluate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on cancer health equity, specifically investigating whether AI is addressing or widening disparities in cancer outcomes.\nRecent studies demonstrate significant advancements in AI, such as deep learning for cancer diagnosis and predictive analytics for personalized treatment, showing potential for improved precision in care. However, concerns persist about the performance of AI tools across diverse populations due to biased training data. Access to AI technologies also remains limited, particularly in low-income and rural settings. AI holds promise for advancing cancer care, but its current application risks exacerbating existing health disparities. To ensure AI benefits all populations, future research must prioritize inclusive datasets, integrate social determinants of health, and develop ethical frameworks. Addressing these challenges is crucial for AI to contribute positively to cancer health equity and guide future research and policy development.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid cancer is a common malignancy that requires comprehensive clinical evaluation prior to adequate surgical management. Over the last three decades thyroid surgery has tripled and is considered one of the most commonly performed procedures in general surgery. These procedures are associated with potential postoperative complications with significant deterioration in the patient's quality of life. While the current rates of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury following thyroidectomy have decreased secondary to intraoperative neuromonitoring, thyroid surgery remains the leading cause of iatrogenic injury. The authors herein present a case of a thyroid nodule with cervical lymph node involvement undergoing total thyroidectomy guided by near-ultraviolet (NUV) imaging nerve auto-fluorescent technology to visualize, identify and protect vital structures.",

    "abstract": "Detecting brain tumours (BT) early improves treatment possibilities and increases patient survival rates. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning offers more comprehensive information, such as better contrast and clarity, than any alternative scanning process. Manually separating BTs from several MRI images gathered in medical practice for cancer analysis is challenging and time-consuming. Tumours and MRI scans of the brain are exposed utilizing methods and machine learning technologies, simplifying the process for doctors. MRI images can sometimes appear normal even when a patient has a tumour or malignancy. Deep learning approaches have recently depended on deep convolutional neural networks to analyze medical images with promising outcomes. It supports saving lives faster and rectifying some medical errors. With this motivation, this article presents a new explainable artificial intelligence with semantic segmentation and Bayesian machine learning for brain tumors (XAISS-BMLBT) technique. The presented XAISS-BMLBT technique mainly concentrates on the semantic segmentation and classification of BT in MRI images. The presented XAISS-BMLBT approach initially involves bilateral filtering-based image pre-processing to eliminate the noise. Next, the XAISS-BMLBT technique performs the MEDU-Net+ segmentation process to define the impacted brain regions. For the feature extraction process, the ResNet50 model is utilized. Furthermore, the Bayesian regularized artificial neural network (BRANN) model is used to identify the presence of BTs. Finally, an improved radial movement optimization model is employed for the hyperparameter tuning of the BRANN technique. To highlight the improved performance of the XAISS-BMLBT technique, a series of simulations were accomplished by utilizing a benchmark database. The experimental validation of the XAISS-BMLBT technique portrayed a superior accuracy value of 97.75% over existing models.",

    "abstract": "Exploring new pathways for the growth of output in the mariculture industry and its alignment with environmentally coordinated and sustainable development has become an urgent task. Against the backdrop of the new technological revolution, the burgeoning development of industrial intelligence offers new opportunities for enhancing the ecological efficiency of China's mariculture. Based on panel data from coastal provinces of China from 2008 to 2022, this paper measures the ecological efficiency of mariculture while comprehensively considering both positive and negative externalities of the industry. This article further investigates the impact of industrial intelligence on the ecological efficiency of mariculture, delves into the role mechanism of industrial upgrading in this context, and explores the issue of regional heterogeneity. The results indicate that, regardless of the inclusion of control variables or fixed effects, industrial intelligence has a significant positive effect on the ecological efficiency of China's mariculture. The promotion effect is strongest in the Bohai Rim economic zone, followed by the Pan-Pearl River Delta economic zone. Furthermore, industrial upgrading serves as a crucial mediating channel through which industrial intelligence exerts its impact. Specifically, industrial intelligence enhances ecological efficiency by facilitating the continuous advancement of the industry towards higher-level and more rational structural configurations.",

    "abstract": "This study intends to optimize the carbon footprint management model of power enterprises through artificial intelligence (AI) technology to help the scientific formulation of carbon emission reduction strategies. Firstly, a carbon footprint calculation model based on big data and AI is established, and then machine learning algorithm is used to deeply mine the carbon emission data of power enterprises to identify the main influencing factors and emission reduction opportunities. Finally, the driver-state-response (DSR) model is used to evaluate the carbon audit of the power industry and comprehensively analyze the effect of carbon emission reduction. Taking China Electric Power Resources and Datang International Electric Power Company as examples, this study uses the comprehensive evaluation method of entropy weight- technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). China Electric Power Resources Company has outstanding performance in promoting renewable energy, with its comprehensive evaluation index rising from 0.5458 in 2020 to 0.627 in 2022, while the evaluation index of Datang International Electric Power Company fluctuated and dropped to 0.421 in 2021. The research conclusion reveals the actual achievements and existing problems of power enterprises in energy saving and emission reduction, and provides reliable carbon information for the government, enterprises, and the public. The main innovation of this study lies in: using artificial intelligence technology to build a carbon footprint calculation model, combining with the data of International Energy Agency Carbon Dioxide (IEA CO2) emission database, and using machine learning algorithm to deeply mine the important factors in carbon emission data, thus putting forward a carbon audit evaluation system of power enterprises based on DSR model. This study not only fills the blank of carbon emission management methods in the power industry, but also provides a new perspective and basis for the government and enterprises to formulate carbon emission reduction strategies.",

    "abstract": "The latest global progress report highlights numerous challenges in achieving justice goals, with bias in artificial intelligence (AI) emerging as a significant yet underexplored issue. This paper investigates the role of AI in addressing bias within the judicial system to promote equitable social justice. Analyzing weekly data from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2023, through wavelet quantile correlation, this study examines the short, medium, and long-term impacts of integrating AI, media, international legal influence (ILI), and international financial institutions (IFI) as crucial factors in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG-16), which focuses on justice. The findings indicate that AI, media, ILI, and IFI can help reduce bias in the medium and long term, although their effects appear mixed and less significant in the short term. Our research proposes a comprehensive policy framework that addresses the complexities of implementing these technologies in the judicial system. We conclude that successfully integrating AI requires a supportive global policy environment that embraces technological innovation, financial backing, and robust regulation to prevent potential disruptions that could reinforce inequalities, perpetuate structural injustices, and exacerbate human rights issues, ultimately leading to more biased outcomes in social justice.",

    "abstract": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) in medical education offers both opportunities and challenges. While these AI-driven tools can enhance access to information and support critical thinking, they also pose risks like potential overreliance and ethical concerns. To ensure ethical use, students and instructors must recognize the limitations of LLMs, maintain academic integrity, handle data cautiously, and instructors should prioritize content quality over AI detection methods. LLMs can be used as supplementary aids rather than primary educational resources, with a focus on enhancing accessibility, equity, and fostering a culture of feedback and AI literacy among students and instructors. Institutions should create guidelines that align with their unique educational values, providing clear frameworks that support responsible LLM usage while addressing risks associated with AI in education. Such guidelines should reflect the institution's pedagogical mission, whether centered on clinical practice, research, or a mix of both, and should be adaptable to evolving educational technologies.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly advancing precision medicine, particularly in the fields of immunogenomics, radiomics, and pathomics. In immunogenomics, AI can process vast amounts of genomic and multi-omic data to identify biomarkers associated with immunotherapy responses and disease prognosis, thus providing strong support for personalized treatments. In radiomics, AI can analyze high-dimensional features from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) images to discover imaging biomarkers associated with tumor heterogeneity, treatment response, and disease progression, thereby enabling non-invasive, real-time assessments for personalized therapy. Pathomics leverages AI for deep analysis of digital pathology images, and can uncover subtle changes in tissue microenvironments, cellular characteristics, and morphological features, and offer unique insights into immunotherapy response prediction and biomarker discovery. These AI-driven technologies not only enhance the speed, accuracy, and robustness of biomarker discovery but also significantly improve the precision, personalization, and effectiveness of clinical treatments, and are driving a shift from empirical to precision medicine. Despite challenges such as data quality, model interpretability, integration of multi-modal data, and privacy protection, the ongoing advancements in AI, coupled with interdisciplinary collaboration, are poised to further enhance AI's roles in biomarker discovery and immunotherapy response prediction. These improvements are expected to lead to more accurate, personalized treatment strategies and ultimately better patient outcomes, marking a significant step forward in the evolution of precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "As humanity progresses further into space, astronauts must be increasingly independent from mission control, especially in high-consequence medical scenarios. The high-utility and low-mass nature of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) makes this imaging modality ideal for spaceflight mission deployment. However, POCUS operator skill degrades over time, presenting an operational barrier to continuous, effective use. Further, formal medical education and POCUS-specific training are not requirements for astronaut candidates, potentially exacerbating skill degradation. Artificial intelligence (AI) assistance may mitigate skill decay, enabling long-term POCUS skill retention. To characterize the utility of this paradigm in space, we evaluated AI assistance effects on POCUS skill retention in subject pools with astronaut-mimicking educational demographics.\nThis prospective cohort study included 30 participants, evenly split into unassisted and AI-assisted cohorts. After undergoing 1 training session, participants collected 5 renal images, bladder images, and bladder volume estimations and completed usability and self-confidence surveys immediately, 2 wk, and 8 wk after initial training. Primary outcomes included target organ capture rates, image quality, bladder volume variability, perceived self-confidence, and perceived system usability.\nAI assistance minimized bladder volume variability aggregated over time (\nPOCUS AI decreased bladder volume variability and mitigated system usability decrement. We recommend increasing study duration or reducing the number of data collections in future study designs and the fieldwide adoption of objective ultrasound image-quality metrics.",

    "abstract": "Part 2 explores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing the complexities of headache disorders through innovative approaches, including digital twin models, wearable healthcare technologies and biosensors, and AI-driven drug discovery. Digital twins, as dynamic digital representations of patients, offer opportunities for personalized headache management by integrating diverse datasets such as neuroimaging, multiomics, and wearable sensor data to advance headache research, optimize treatment, and enable virtual trials. In addition, AI-driven wearable devices equipped with next-generation biosensors combined with multi-agent chatbots could enable real-time physiological and biochemical monitoring, diagnosing, facilitating early headache attack forecasting and prevention, disease tracking, and personalized interventions. Furthermore, AI-driven advances in drug discovery leverage machine learning and generative AI to accelerate the identification of novel therapeutic targets and optimize treatment strategies for migraine and other headache disorders. Despite these advances, challenges such as data standardization, model explainability, and ethical considerations remain pivotal. Collaborative efforts between clinicians, biomedical and biotechnological engineers, AI scientists, legal representatives and bioethics experts are essential to overcoming these barriers and unlocking AI's full potential in transforming headache research and healthcare. This is a call to action in proposing novel frameworks for integrating AI-based technologies into headache care.",

This state-wide study, funded by the Government of Punjab, evaluated the use of Thermalytix, a low-cost, radiation-free AI tool, for breast cancer screening. Community health workers, trained to raise awareness, mobilized women aged 30 and above for screening. Thermalytix triaged women into five risk categories based on thermal images, with high-risk women recalled for diagnostic imaging. Over 18 months, 15,069 women were screened across 183 locations in Punjab. The median age was 41 years, and 69.9% were asymptomatic. Of 460 women testing positive (recall rate 3.1%), 268 underwent follow-up imaging, and 27 were confirmed with breast cancer, yielding a detection rate of 0.18%. The positive predictive value of biopsy performed was 81.81%, and the median diagnostic interval was 21 days, with therapy initiation within 30 days. The study demonstrates the potential of Thermalytix for effective population-level breast cancer screening in low-resource settings.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a form of cancer that impacts both the rectum and colon. Typically, it begins with a small abnormal growth known as a polyp, which can either be non-cancerous or cancerous. Therefore, early detection of colorectal cancer as the second deadliest cancer after lung cancer, can be highly beneficial. Moreover, the standard treatment for locally advanced colorectal cancer, which is widely accepted around the world, is chemoradiotherapy. Then, in this study, seven artificial intelligence models including decision tree, K-nearest neighbors, Adaboost, random forest, Gradient Boosting, multi-layer perceptron, and convolutional neural network were implemented to detect patients responder and non-responder to radiochemotherapy. For finding the potential predictors (genes), three feature selection strategies were employed including mutual information, F-classif, and Chi-Square. Based on feature selection models, four different scenarios were developed and five, ten, twenty and thirty features selected for designing a more accurate classification paradigm. The results of this study confirm that random forest, Gradient Boosting, decision tree, and K-nearest neighbors provided more accurate results in terms of accuracy, by 93.8%. Moreover, Among the feature selection methods, mutual information and F-classif showed the best results, while Chi-Square produced the worst results. Therefore, the suggested artificial intelligence models can be successfully applied as a robust approach for classification of colorectal cancer response to radiochemotherapy for medical studies.",

    "abstract": "Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) across numerous disciplines has transformed the worldwide landscape of pandemic response. This review investigates the multidimensional role of AI in the pandemic, which arises as a global health crisis, and its role in preparedness and responses, ranging from enhanced epidemiological modelling to the acceleration of vaccine development. The confluence of AI technologies has guided us in a new era of data-driven decision-making, revolutionizing our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and treat infectious illnesses. The review begins by discussing the impact of a pandemic on emerging countries worldwide, elaborating on the critical significance of AI in epidemiological modelling, bringing data-driven decision-making, and enabling forecasting, mitigation and response to the pandemic. In epidemiology, AI-driven epidemiological models like SIR\u00a0(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) and SIS\u00a0(Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) are applied to predict the spread of disease, preventing outbreaks and optimising vaccine distribution. The review also demonstrates how Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and predictive analytics improve our knowledge of disease propagation patterns. The collaborative aspect of AI in vaccine discovery and clinical trials of various vaccines is emphasised, focusing on constructing AI-powered surveillance networks. Conclusively, the review presents a comprehensive assessment of how AI impacts epidemiological modelling, builds AI-enabled dynamic models by collaborating ML and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, and develops and implements vaccines and clinical trials. The review also focuses on screening, forecasting, contact tracing and monitoring the virus-causing pandemic. It advocates for sustained research, real-world implications, ethical application and strategic integration of AI technologies to strengthen our collective ability to face and alleviate the effects of global health issues.",

    "abstract": "Bladder cancer is the 10th most common and 13th most deadly cancer worldwide, with urothelial carcinomas being the most common type. Distinguishing between non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is essential due to significant differences in management and prognosis. MRI may play an important diagnostic role in this setting. The Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS), a multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)-based consensus reporting platform, allows for standardized preoperative muscle invasion assessment in BCa with proven diagnostic accuracy. However, post-treatment assessment using VI-RADS is challenging because of anatomical changes, especially in the interpretation of the muscle layer. MRI techniques that provide tumor tissue physiological\u00a0information, including diffusion-weighted (DW)- and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, combined with derived quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIBs), may potentially overcome the limitations of BCa evaluation when predominantly focusing on anatomic changes at MRI, particularly in the therapy response setting. Delta-radiomics, which encompasses the assessment of changes (\u0394)\u00a0in image features extracted from mpMRI data, has the potential to monitor treatment response. In comparison to the current Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), QIBs and mpMRI-based radiomics, in combination with artificial intelligence (AI)-based image analysis, may potentially allow for earlier identification of therapy-induced tumor changes. This review provides an update on the potential of QIBs and mpMRI-based radiomics and discusses the future applications of AI in BCa management, particularly in assessing treatment response. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Incorporating mpMRI-based quantitative imaging biomarkers, radiomics, and artificial intelligence into bladder cancer management has the potential to enhance treatment response assessment and prognosis prediction. KEY POINTS: Quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIBs) from mpMRI and radiomics can outperform RECIST for bladder cancer treatments. AI improves mpMRI segmentation and enhances radiomics feature extraction effectively. Predictive models integrate imaging biomarkers and clinical data using AI tools. Multicenter studies with strict criteria validate radiomics and QIBs clinically. Consistent mpMRI and AI applications need reliable validation in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common type of scoliosis, affecting 1-4% of adolescents. The Scoliosis Research Society-22R (SRS-22R), a health-related quality-of-life instrument for AIS, has allowed orthopedists to measure subjective patient outcomes before and after corrective surgery beyond objective radiographic measurements. However, research has revealed that there is no significant correlation between the correction rate in major radiographic parameters and improvements in patient-reported outcomes (PROs), making it difficult to incorporate PROs into personalized surgical planning.\nThe objective of this study is to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled surgical planning and counseling support system for post-operative patient rehabilitation outcomes prediction in order to facilitate personalized AIS patient care. A unique multi-site cohort of 455 pediatric patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery at two Shriners Children's hospitals from 2010 is investigated in our analysis. In total, 171 pre-operative clinical features are used to train six machine-learning models for post-operative outcomes prediction. We further employ explainability analysis to quantify the contribution of pre-operative radiographic and questionnaire parameters in predicting patient surgical outcomes. Moreover, we enable responsible AI by calibrating model confidence for human intervention and mitigating health disparities for algorithm fairness.\nThe best prediction model achieves an area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) performance of 0.86, 0.85, and 0.83 for individual SRS-22R question response prediction over three-time horizons from pre-operation to 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year post-operation, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed prediction method to predict other patient rehabilitation outcomes based on minimal clinically important differences (MCID) and correction rates across all three-time horizons.\nBased on the relationship analysis, we suggest additional attention to sagittal parameters (e.g., lordosis, sagittal vertical axis) and patient self-image beyond major Cobb angles to improve surgical decision-making for AIS patients. In the age of personalized medicine, the proposed responsible AI-enabled clinical decision-support system may facilitate pre-operative counseling and shared decision-making within real-world clinical settings.\nThe goal of this study is to develop a planning and counseling support system for predicting how well patients recover after surgeries. This should allow for more personalized care for scoliosis (spinal curvature) patients. We collected data from 455 pediatric patients who underwent spinal fusion surgery at different locations and used this data to train computer learning methods to predict outcomes after surgery. We show that our proposed computer method can predict the outcome of patient rehabilitation well for short-term (6-month and 1-year) and long-term (2-year) results. We applied additional tests to our method to calculate how well it works and measure fairness to provide a straight-forward, trustworthy, and fair method for real-world clinical use.",

    "abstract": "As per world health organization, Anemia is a most prevalent blood disorder all over the world. Reduced number of Red Blood Cells or decrease in the number of healthy red blood cells is considered as Anemia. This condition also leads to the decrease in the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. The main goal of this research is to develop a dependable method for diagnosing Aplastic Anemia and Iron Deficiency Anemia by examining the blood test attributes. As of today, there are no studies which use Interpretable Artificial Intelligence to perform the above differential diagnosis. The dataset used in this study is collected from Kasturba Medical College, Manipal. The dataset consisted of various blood test attributes such as Red Blood cell count, Hemoglobin level, Mean Corpuscular Volume, etc. One of the trending topics in Machine Learning is Explainable Artificial Intelligence. They are known to demystify the machine learning outputs to all its stakeholders. Hence, Five XAI tools including SHAP, LIME, Eli5, Qlattice and Anchor are used to understand the model's predictions. The importance characteristics according to XAI models are PLT, PCT, MCV, PDW, HGB, ABS LYMP, WBC, MCH, and MCHC. are employed to train and test the data. The goal of using data analytic techniques is to give medical professionals a useful tool that improves decision-making, enhances resource management, and eventually raises the standard of patient care. By considering the unique qualities of each patient, medical professionals who must rely on AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment suggestions, XAI offers arguments to strengthen their faith in the model outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid cytopathology, particularly in cases of atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesions of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS), suffers from suboptimal sensitivity and specificity challenges. Recent advancements in digital pathology and artificial intelligence (AI) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy. This systematic review included studies from 2000 to 2023, focusing on diagnostic accuracy in AUS/FLUS cases using AI, whole slide imaging (WSI), or both. Of the 176 studies, 13 met the inclusion criteria. The datasets range from 145 to 964 WSIs, with an overall number of 494 AUS cases ranging from eight to 254. Five studies used convolutional neural networks (CNN), and two used artificial neural networks (ANN). The preparation methods included Romanowsky-stained smears either alone or combined with Papanicolaou-stained or H&amp;E, and Liquid-based cytology (ThinPrep). The scanner models that were used for scanning the slides varied, including Leica/Aperio, Alyuda Neurointelligence Cupertino, and PANNORAMIC\u2122 Desk Scanner. Classifiers used include Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN), Two-Layer Feedforward Neural Networks (2L-FFNN), Classifier Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA), Visual Geometry Group 11 (VGG11), Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), Extra Trees Classifier (ETC), YOLOv4, EfficientNetV2-L, Back-Propagation on Multi-Layer Perceptron, and MobileNetV2. Although cytopathology is late in adopting AI, available studies have shown promising results in differentiating between thyroid lesions, including AUS/FLUS. Our review showed that AI can be especially effective in removing sources of errors such as subjective assessment, variation in staining, and algorithms. CNN has been successful in processing WSI data and identifying diagnostic features with minimal human supervision. ANNs excelled in integrating structured clinical data with image-derived features, particularly when paired with WSI, enhancing diagnostic accuracy for indeterminate thyroid lesions. A combined approach using both CNN and ANN can take advantage of their strengths. While AI and WSI integration shows promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing uncertainty in indeterminate thyroid cytology, challenges such as the lack of standardization need to be addressed. This review highlights the heterogeneity in study designs, dataset sizes, and evaluation metrics. Future studies should focus on hybrid AI models, CNNs, ANNs, and standardized methodologies to maximize clinical applicability.",

    "abstract": "The current review examined the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in palliative care, specifically focusing on models used to identify potential beneficiaries of palliative services among individuals with chronic and terminal illnesses.\nA systematic review was conducted across four electronic databases. Five studies met inclusion criteria, all of which applied AI/ML models to predict outcomes relevant to palliative care, such as mortality or the need for services.\nOf 1,504 studies screened, five studies used supervised ML algorithms, whereas one used natural language processing with a deep learning model to identify potential palliative care candidates. The most common AI/ML algorithms included neural network-based models, logistic regression, and tree-based models.\nAI and ML models offer promising avenues for identifying palliative care beneficiaries. As AI continues to evolve, its potential to reshape palliative care through early identification is significant, providing opportunities for timely and targeted care interventions. [",

    "abstract": "The most widely used social media platform for video content is YouTubeTM. The present study evaluated the quality of information on YouTubeTM on artificial intelligence (AI) in dentistry.\nThis cross-sectional study used YouTubeTM (https://www.youtube.com) for searching videos. The terms used for the search were \"artificial intelligence in dentistry,\" \"machine learning in dental care,\" and \"deep learning in dentistry.\" The accuracy and reliability of the information source were assessed using the DISCERN score. The quality of the videos was evaluated using the modified Global Quality Score (mGQS) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) score.\nThe analysis of 91 YouTube\u2122 videos on AI in dentistry revealed insights into video characteristics, content, and quality. On average, videos were 22.45 minutes and received 1715.58 views and 23.79 likes. The topics were mainly centered on general dentistry (66%), with radiology (18%), orthodontics (9%), prosthodontics (4%), and implants (3%). DISCERN and mGQS scores were higher for videos uploaded by healthcare professionals and educational content videos(P<0.05). DISCERN exhibited a strong correlation (0.75) with the video source and with JAMA (0.77). The correlation of the video's content and mGQS, was 0.66 indicated moderate correlation.\nYouTube\u2122 has informative and moderately reliable videos on AI in dentistry. Dental students, dentists and patients can use these videos to learn and educate about artificial intelligence in dentistry.

    "abstract": "Current limitations in implant design often lead to trade-offs between minimally invasive surgery and achieving the desired post-implantation functionality. Here, we present an artificial intelligence inverse design paradigm for creating deployable implants as planar and tubular thermal mechanical metamaterials (thermo-metamaterials). These thermo-metamaterial implants exhibit tunable mechanical properties and volume change in response to temperature changes, enabling minimally invasive and personalized surgery. We begin by generating a large database of corrugated thermo-metamaterials with various cell structures and bending stiffnesses. An artificial intelligence inverse design model is subsequently developed by integrating an evolutionary algorithm with a neural network. This model allows for the automatic determination of the optimal microstructure for thermo-metamaterials with desired performance,i.e., target bending stiffness. We validate this approach by designing patient-specific spinal fusion implants and tracheal stents. The results demonstrate that the deployable thermo-metamaterial implants can achieve over a 200% increase in volume or cross-sectional area in their fully deployed states. Finally, we propose a broader vision for a clinically informed artificial intelligence design process that prioritizes biocompatibility, feasibility, and precision simultaneously for the development of high-performing and clinically viable implants. The feasibility of this proposed vision is demonstrated using a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to customize thermo-metamaterial implants based on clinically relevant factors.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension underpins significant global morbidity and mortality. Early lifestyle intervention and treatment are effective in reducing adverse outcomes. Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiography (AI-ECG) has been shown to identify a broad spectrum of subclinical disease and may be useful for predicting incident hypertension.\nTo develop an AI-ECG risk estimator (AIRE) to predict incident hypertension (AIRE-HTN) and stratify risk for hypertension-associated adverse outcomes.\nThis was a development and external validation prognostic cohort study conducted at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, Massachusetts, a secondary care setting. External validation was conducted in the UK Biobank (UKB), a UK-based volunteer cohort. AIRE-HTN was trained and tested to predict incident hypertension using routinely collected ECGs from patients at BIDMC between 2014 and 2023. The algorithm was then evaluated to risk stratify patients for hypertension- associated adverse outcomes and externally validated on UKB data between 2014 and 2022 for both incident hypertension and risk stratification.\nAIRE-HTN, which uses a residual convolutional neural network architecture with a discrete-time survival loss function, was trained to predict incident hypertension.\nAIRE-HTN was trained on 1\u202f163\u202f401 ECGs from 189\u202f539 patients (mean [SD] age, 57.7 [18.7] years; 98\u202f747 female [52.1%]) at BIDMC. A total of 19\u202f423 BIDMC patients composed the test set and were evaluated for incident hypertension. From the UKB, AIRE-HTN was tested on 65\u202f610 ECGs from same number of participants (mean [SD] age, 65.4 [7.9] years; 33\u202f785 female [51.5%]). A total of 35\u202f806 UKB patients were evaluated for incident hypertension. AIRE-HTN predicted incident hypertension (BIDMC: n\u2009=\u20096446 [33%] events; C index, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.69-0.71; UKB: n\u2009=\u20091532 [4%] events; C index, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.69-0.71). Performance was maintained in individuals without left ventricular hypertrophy and those with normal ECGs (C indices, 0.67-0.72). AIRE-HTN was significantly additive to existing clinical risk factors in predicting incident hypertension (continuous net reclassification index, BIDMC: 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33-0.53; UKB: 0.32; 95% CI, 0.23-0.37). In adjusted Cox models, AIRE-HTN score was an independent predictor of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio [HR] per standard deviation, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.67-3.00) and stratified risk for heart failure (HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 2.22-3.04), myocardial infarction (HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 2.55-3.83), ischemic stroke (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11-1.37), and chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.68-2.12), beyond traditional risk factors.\nResults suggest that AIRE-HTN, an AI-ECG model, can predict incident hypertension and identify patients at risk of hypertension-related adverse events, beyond conventional clinical risk factors.",

A total of 19\u202f423 BIDMC patients composed the test set and were evaluated for incident hypertension. From the UKB, AIRE-HTN was tested on 65\u202f610 ECGs from same number of participants (mean [SD] age, 65.4 [7.9] years; 33\u202f785 female [51.5%]). A total of 35\u202f806 UKB patients were evaluated for incident hypertension. AIRE-HTN predicted incident hypertension (BIDMC: n\u2009=\u20096446 [33%] events; C index, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.69-0.71; UKB: n\u2009=\u20091532 [4%] events; C index, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.69-0.71). Performance was maintained in individuals without left ventricular hypertrophy and those with normal ECGs (C indices, 0.67-0.72). AIRE-HTN was significantly additive to existing clinical risk factors in predicting incident hypertension (continuous net reclassification index, BIDMC: 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33-0.53; UKB: 0.32; 95% CI, 0.23-0.37). In adjusted Cox models, AIRE-HTN score was an independent predictor of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio [HR] per standard deviation, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.67-3.00) and stratified risk for heart failure (HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 2.22-3.04), myocardial infarction (HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 2.55-3.83), ischemic stroke (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11-1.37), and chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.68-2.12), beyond traditional risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Women are disproportionately affected by chronic autoimmune diseases (AD) like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Traditional evaluations often underestimate the associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke risk in women having AD. Vitamin D deficiency increases susceptibility to these conditions. CVD risk prediction in AD can benefit from surrogate biomarker for coronary artery disease (CAD), such as carotid ultrasound. Due to non-linearity in the CVD risk stratification, we use artificial intelligence-based system using AD biomarkers and carotid ultrasound. Investigate the relationship between AD and CVD/stroke markers including autoantibody-influenced plaque load. Second, to study the surrogate biomarkers for the CAD and gather radiomics-based features such as carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), and plaque area (PA). Third and final, explore the automated CVD/stroke risk identification using advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) paradigms. Analysed biomarker data from women with AD, including carotid ultrasonography imaging, clinical parameters, autoantibody profiles, and vitamin D levels. Proposed artificial intelligence (AI) models to predict CVD/stroke risk accurately in AD for women. There is a strong association between AD duration and elevated cIMT/PA, with increased CVD risk linked to higher rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs) levels. AI models outperformed conventional methods by integrating imaging data and disorder-specific factors. Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial for managing CVD/stroke in women with chronic autoimmune diseases. AI-based assisted risk stratification methods may improve treatment decision-making and cardiovascular outcomes.",

    "abstract": "To investigate integrating an artificial intelligence (AI) system into diagnostic breast ultrasound (US) for improved performance.\nSeventy suspicious breast mass lesions (53 malignant and 17 benign) from seventy women who underwent diagnostic breast US complemented with shear wave elastography, US-guided core needle biopsy and verified histopathology were enrolled. Two radiologists, one with 15 years of experience and the other with one year of experience, evaluated the images for breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) scoring. The less-experienced radiologist re-evaluated the images with the guidance of a commercial AI system and the maximum elasticity from shear wave elastography. The BI-RADS scorings were processed to determine diagnostic performance and malignancy detections.\nThe experienced reader demonstrated superior performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.888 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.793-0.983], indicating high diagnostic accuracy. In contrast, the Koios decision support (DS) system achieved an AUC of 0.693 (95% CI: 0.562-0.824). The less-experienced reader, guided by both Koios and elasticity, showed an AUC of 0.679 (95% CI: 0.534-0.823), while Koios alone resulted in an AUC of 0.655 (95% CI: 0.512-0.799). Without any guidance, the less-experienced reader exhibited the lowest performance, with an AUC of 0.512 (95% CI: 0.352-0.672). The experienced reader had a sensitivity of 98.1%, specificity of 58.8%, positive predictive value of 88.1%, negative predictive value of 90.9%, and overall accuracy of 88.6%. The Koios DS showed a sensitivity of 92.5%, specificity of 35.3%, and an accuracy of 78.6%. The less-experienced reader, when guided by both Koios and elasticity, achieved a sensitivity of 92.5%, specificity of 23.5%, and an accuracy of 75.7%. When guided by Koios alone, the less-experienced reader had a sensitivity of 90.6%, specificity of 17.6%, and an accuracy of 72.9%. Lastly, the less-experienced reader without any guidance showed a sensitivity of 84.9%, specificity of 17.6%, and an accuracy of 68.6%.\nDiagnostic evaluation of the suspicious masses on breast US images largely depends on experience, with experienced readers showing good performances. AI-based guidance can help improve lower performances, and using the elasticity metric may further improve the performances of less experienced readers. This type of guidance may reduce unnecessary biopsies by increasing the detection rate for malignant lesions and deliver significant benefits for routine clinical practice in underserved areas where experienced readers may not be available.",

    "abstract": "A significant area of computer science called artificial intelligence (AI) is successfully applied to the analysis of intricate biological data and the extraction of substantial associations from datasets for a variety of biomedical uses. AI has attracted significant interest in biomedical research due to its features: (i) better patient care through early diagnosis and detection; (ii) enhanced workflow; (iii) lowering medical errors; (v) lowering medical costs; (vi) reducing morbidity and mortality; (vii) enhancing performance; (viii) enhancing precision; and (ix) time efficiency. Quantitative metrics are crucial for evaluating AI implementations, providing insights, enabling informed decisions, and measuring the impact of AI-driven initiatives, thereby enhancing transparency, accountability, and overall impact. The implementation of AI in biomedical fields faces challenges such as ethical and privacy concerns, lack of awareness, technology unreliability, and professional liability. A brief discussion is given of the AI techniques, which include Virtual screening (VS), DL, ML, Hidden Markov models (HMMs), Neural networks (NNs), Generative models (GMs), Molecular dynamics (MD), and Structure-activity relationship (SAR) models. The study explores the application of AI in biomedical fields, highlighting its enhanced predictive accuracy, treatment efficacy, diagnostic efficiency, faster decision-making, personalised treatment strategies, and precise medical interventions.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the ecological footprint awareness and ecological intelligence levels of nurses working in a hospital.\nThis descriptive study was conducted with 290 nurses working in a hospital. The study data were collected using a descriptive questionnaire, \"Ecological Intelligence Scale\", and \"Ecological Footprint Awareness Scale\". Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS v23. The conformity of the data to the normal distribution was examined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Pearson Correlation analysis and Regression analysis were used to determine and explain the relationships between variables.\nThe mean age of the nurses in the study was 34.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.53 and 85.9% were female. A statistically significant relationship was found between nurses' membership in an environmental association or organization (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.192; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and their reaction to individuals who pollute the environment (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.208; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and ecological intelligence.

    "abstract": "This theoretical paper offers an in-depth examination of the intersection between Theory of Mind (ToM) and artificial intelligence (AI), drawing on developmental psychology and philosophical analysis. By investigating the key developmental stages at which children begin to understand that others have distinct mental states, the paper provides a framework for assessing the cognitive boundaries of AI systems. It critically interrogates the pervasive human inclination to anthropomorphize machines, particularly through the attribution of complex mental states like \"knowing,\" \"thinking,\" or \"believing\" to AI entities that lack subjective experience. The paper argues that AI, while capable of simulating cognitive processes, operates without the conscious awareness that defines human cognition, raising profound epistemological and ethical questions. It explores the broader implications of this projection for society, considering how our conceptualization of AI affects both technological development and social structures. Ultimately, this interdisciplinary inquiry calls for a more nuanced understanding of the distinctions between human and machine cognition, advocating for responsible approaches to AI as its capabilities evolve.",

    "abstract": "Achieving histological remission is a desirable emerging treatment target in ulcerative colitis (UC), yet its assessment is challenging due to high inter- and intraobserver variability, reliance on experts, and lack of standardization. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise in addressing these issues. This systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression evaluated the AI's performance in assessing histological remission and compared it with that of pathologists.\nWe searched Medline/PubMed and Scopus databases from inception to September 2024. We included studies on AI models assessing histological activity in UC, with or without comparison to pathologists. Pooled performance metrics were calculated: sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV), observed agreement, and F1 score. A pairwise meta-analysis compared AI and pathologists, while sub-meta-analysis and meta-regression evaluated heterogeneity and factors influencing AI performance.\nTwelve studies met the inclusion criteria. AI models exhibited strong performance with a pooled sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.80-0.88), specificity 0.87 (0.84-0.91), PPV 0.90 (0.87-0.92), NPV 0.80 (0.71-0.88), observed agreement 0.85 (0.82-0.89), and F1 score 0.85 (0.82-0.89). AI models demonstrated no significant differences with pathologists for specificity, observed agreement, and F1 score, while they were outperformed by pathologists for sensitivity and NPV. AI models for the adult population were linked to reduced heterogeneity and enhanced AI performance at meta-regression.\nAI shows significant potential for assessing histological remission in UC and performs comparably to pathologists. Future research should focus on standardized, large-scale studies to minimize heterogeneity and support widespread AI implementation in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Hyperkalemia can be detected by point-of-care (POC) blood testing and by artificial intelligence- enabled electrocardiography (ECG). These 2 methods of detecting hyperkalemia have not been compared.\nTo determine the accuracy of POC and ECG potassium measurements for hyperkalemia detection in patients with critical illness.\nThis retrospective study involved intensive care patients in an academic medical center from October 2020 to September 2021. Patients who had 12-lead ECG, POC potassium measurement, and central laboratory potassium measurement within 1 hour were included. The POC potassium measurements were obtained from arterial blood gas analysis; ECG potassium measurements were calculated by a previously developed deep learning model. Hyperkalemia was defined as a central laboratory potassium measurement of 5.5 mEq/L or greater.\nFifteen patients with hyperkalemia and 252 patients without hyperkalemia were included. The POC and ECG potassium measurements were available about 35 minutes earlier than central laboratory results. Correlation with central laboratory potassium measurement was better for POC testing than for ECG (mean absolute errors of 0.211 mEq/L and 0.684 mEq/L, respectively). For POC potassium measurement, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to detect hyperkalemia was 0.933, sensitivity was 73.3%, and specificity was 98.4%. For ECG potassium measurement, AUC was 0.884, sensitivity was 93.3%, and specificity was 63.5%.\nThe ECG potassium measurement, with its high sensitivity and coverage rate, may be used initially and followed by POC potassium measurement for rapid detection of life-threatening hyperkalemia.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy (DA) for colorectal adenomas (CRA), screened by fecal immunochemical test (FIT), using five artificial intelligence (AI) models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM). These models were tested together with clinical features categorized as low-risk (lowR) and high-risk (highR).\nThe colorectal neoplasia (CRN) screening cohort of 5,090 patients included 222 CRA patients and 264 non-CRA patients. Three consecutive fecal samples from each individual were analyzed by two fecal occult blood (FOB) assays. Five AI models including clinical features of CRN patients and CV test results were used to test the DA for CRA measured by receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves.\nIn conventional ROC analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) values for different AI models ranged from 0.659 and 0.691 (for AIs with LR and SVM), while the highest AUC values were reached by NN, RF, and GBM models (0.809, 0.840, and 0.858, respectively). In the hierarchical summary ROC (HSROC) analysis, the AUC values were as follows: i) with lowR variables, AUC=0.508; ii) with highR variables, AUC=0.566 and iii) with all AI models, AUC= 0.789. The differences in AUC values were: between i) and ii) p=0.008; between i) and iii) p<0.0001 and between ii) and iii) p<0.0001.\nIn detection of CRA, the AI models proved to be superior to the diagnostic features without AI. This is the first study to report that DA in the diagnosis of CRA can be enhanced by AI models that include clinical data of the patients and results of FIT test.",

    "abstract": "Perimembranous ventricular septal defect (PMVSD) is a prevalent congenital heart disease, presenting challenges in predicting spontaneous closure, which is crucial for therapeutic decisions. Existing models mainly rely on structured echocardiographic parameters or restricted data. This study introduces an artificial intelligence (AI)-based model, which uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning with the aim of improving spontaneous closure predictability in PMVSD.\nWe did a multicentre, retrospective analysis using data from 29\u2008142 PMVSD patients across six tertiary centres in China from May, 2004, to September, 2022, for training (70%) and validation (30%; dataset 1, 27\u2008269 patients), and from September, 2001, to December, 2009 for testing (dataset 2, 1873 patients). NLP extracted structured data from echocardiography reports and medical records, which were used to develop machine learning models. Models were evaluated for spontaneous closure occurrence and timing by use of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), decision curve analysis, and calibration index.\nSpontaneous closure occurred in 3520 patients (12\u00b71%) at a median of 31 months (IQR 16-56). Eleven NLP-derived predictors, identified via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, highlighted the importance of defect morphology and patient age. The random survival forest algorithm, selected for its superior concordance indexes, showed excellent predictive performance with validation set AUCs (95% CI) of 0\u00b795 (0\u00b794-0\u00b796) for 1-year and 3-year predictions, and 0\u00b795 (0\u00b795-0\u00b796) for 5-year predictions; testing set AUCs were 0\u00b795 (0\u00b794-0\u00b797) for 1-year predictions, 0\u00b797 (0\u00b796-0\u00b798) for 3-year predictions, and 0\u00b798 (0\u00b797-0\u00b799) for 5-year predictions. The model showed high clinical utility through decision curve analysis, calibration, and risk stratification, maintaining consistent accuracy across centres and subgroups.\nThis AI-based model for predicting spontaneous closure in PMVSD patients represents a substantial advancement, potentially improving patient management, reducing risks of delayed or inappropriate treatment, and enhancing clinical outcomes.\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China, Shanghai Municipal Hospital Clinical Technology Project, Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, and Clinical Research Unit of XinHua Hospital.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative infections significantly impact patient outcomes and costs, exacerbated by late diagnoses, yet early reliable predictors are scarce. Existing artificial intelligence (AI) models for postoperative infection prediction often lack external validation or perform poorly in local settings when validated. We aimed to develop locally valid models as part of the PERISCOPE AI system to enable early detection, safer discharge, and more timely treatment of patients.\nWe developed and validated XGBoost models to predict postoperative infections within 7 and 30 days of surgery. Using retrospective pre-operative and intra-operative electronic health record data from 2014 to 2023 across various surgical specialities, the models were developed at Hospital A and validated and updated at Hospitals B and C in the Netherlands and Belgium. Model performance was evaluated before and after updating using the two most recent years of data as temporal validation datasets. Main outcome measures were model discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)), calibration (slope, intercept, and plots), and clinical utility (decision curve analysis with net benefit).\nThe study included 253,010 surgical procedures with 23,903 infections within 30-days. Discriminative performance, calibration properties, and clinical utility significantly improved after updating. Final AUROCs after updating for Hospitals A, B, and C were 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-0.83), 0.82 (95% CI 0.81-0.83), and 0.91 (95% CI 0.90-0.91) respectively for 30-day predictions on the temporal validation datasets (2022-2023). Calibration plots demonstrated adequate correspondence between observed outcomes and predicted risk. All local models were deemed clinically useful as the net benefit was higher than default strategies (treat all and treat none) over a wide range of clinically relevant decision thresholds.\nPERISCOPE can accurately predict overall postoperative infections within 7- and 30-days post-surgery. The robust performance implies potential for improving clinical care in diverse clinical target populations. This study supports the need for approaches to local updating of AI models to account for domain shifts in patient populations and data distributions across different clinical settings.\nThis study was funded by a REACT EU grant from European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Kansen voor West.",

    "abstract": "The EZ DEVICE is an integrated fluorescence microflow cytometer designed for automated cell phenotyping and enumeration using artificial intelligence (AI). The platform consists of a laser diode, optical filter, objective lens, CMOS image sensor, and microfluidic chip, enabling automated sample pretreatment, labeling, and detection within a single compact unit. AI algorithms segment and identify objects in images captured by the CMOS sensor at 532 and 586\u00a0nm emission wavelengths. The device's counting performance, tested with rainbow and FITC-labeled beads, closely matched results from manual counting using an Olympus IX73 microscope. Antibody-staining efficiency was evaluated with antibody-particle beads and IgG k isotype-FITC, achieving a 99.06% staining efficiency. Practical feasibility was demonstrated through the phenotyping of immune cell lines (Jurkat T and THP-1) using specific fluorescent antibodies. The system successfully detected MHC I expression and distinguished CD3 expression patterns in Jurkat T-cells, demonstrating its capability to recognize distinct cell statuses. With its compact design, automated features, and efficient staining and detection, the EZ DEVICE shows promise for diverse applications, including clinical diagnostics, point-of-care testing, and research, enabling real-time immune monitoring and precise cell analysis. Future enhancements, such as optimized microfluidics, advanced imaging, and AI-driven algorithms, aim to improve single-cell throughput and expand its utility in personalized medicine and public health.",

    "abstract": "Automated retinal image analysis using Artificial Intelligence (AI) can detect diabetic retinopathy as accurately as human graders, but it is not yet licensed in the NHS Diabetic Eye Screening Programme (DESP) in England. This study aims to assess perceptions of People Living with Diabetes (PLD) and Healthcare Practitioners (HCP) towards AI's introduction in DESP.\nTwo online surveys were co-developed with PLD and HCP from a diverse DESP in North East London. Surveys were validated through interviews across three centres and distributed via DESP centres, charities, and the British Association of Retinal Screeners. A coding framework was used to analyse free-text responses.\n387 (24%) PLD and 98 (37%) HCP provided comments. Themes included trust, workforce impact, the patient-practitioner relationship, AI implementation challenges, and inequalities. Both groups agreed AI in DESP was inevitable, would improve efficiency, and save costs. Concerns included job losses, data security, and AI decision safety. A common misconception was that AI would directly affect patient interactions, though it only processes retinal images.\nLimited understanding of AI was a barrier to acceptance. Educating diverse PLD groups and HCP about AI's accuracy and reliability is crucial to building trust and facilitating its integration into screening practices.",

    "abstract": "The application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models and algorithms in clinical laboratories is a new inevitable stage of development of laboratory medicine, since in the future, diagnostic and prognostic panels specific to certain diseases will be created from a large amount of laboratory data. Thanks to machine learning (ML), it is possible to analyze a large amount of structured numerical data as well as unstructured digitized images in the field of hematology, cytology and histopathology. Numerous researches refer to the testing of ML models for the purpose of screening various diseases, detecting damage to organ systems, diagnosing malignant diseases, longitudinal monitoring of various biomarkers that would enable predicting the outcome of each patient's treatment. The main advantages of advanced AI in the clinical laboratory are: faster diagnosis using diagnostic and prognostic algorithms, individualization of treatment plans, personalized medicine, better patient treatment outcomes, easier and more precise longitudinal monitoring of biomarkers, ",

    "abstract": "Single-cell omics technologies have revolutionized the study of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), offering unprecedented resolution in elucidating their expression dynamics, cell-type specificity, and associated gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Concurrently, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies has significantly advanced our understanding of lncRNA functions and its implications in disease pathogenesis. This chapter discusses the progress in single-cell omics data analysis, emphasizing its pivotal role in unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular heterogeneity and the associated regulatory networks involving lncRNAs. Additionally, we provide a summary of single-cell omics resources and AI models for constructing single-cell gene regulatory networks (scGRNs). Finally, we explore the challenges and prospects of exploring scGRNs in the context of lncRNA biology.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is addressing many expectations for healthcare practitioners and patients in oncology. It has the potential to deeply transform medical practices as we know them today: improving early diagnosis by analysing large quantities of medical data, refining personalised treatment plans and optimising patient follow-up. AI also makes it easier to identify new biomarkers and predict responses to therapies, reducing margins of error and speeding up clinical decisions. Among the most popular types of AI to revolutionise clinical practice are language models. In a perfect world, the integration of AI would promote more precise, personalised and efficient care, while relieving healthcare providers of tedious or repetitive tasks, allowing them to concentrate more on providing human support to patients, and all this with a low energy consumption. However, the large-scale deployment of AI currently raises fundamental questions about fairness, safety of use and how to assess the results obtained from AI longitudinally. This article explores how the many applications are evaluated for our practice (spoiler alert: they are currently limited), potential clinical benefits and challenges currently encountered when dealing with the integration of AI into routine oncology care. We will focus on language models whose development has been exploding since 2021.",

    "abstract": "Negative emotions such as loneliness, depression, and anxiety (LDA) are prevalent and pose significant challenges to emotional well-being. Traditional methods of assessing LDA, reliant on questionnaires, often face limitations because of participants' inability or potential bias. This study introduces emoLDAnet, an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven psychological framework that leverages video-recorded conversations to detect negative emotions through the analysis of facial expressions and physiological signals. We recruited 50 participants to undergo questionnaires and interviews, with their responses recorded on video. The emoLDAnet employs a combination of deep learning (e.g., VGG11) and machine learning (e.g., decision trees [DTs]) to identify emotional states. The emoLDAnet incorporates the OCC-PAD-LDA psychological transformation model, enhancing the interpretability of AI decisions by translating facial expressions into psychologically meaningful data. Results indicate that emoLDAnet achieves high detection rates for loneliness, depression, and anxiety, with F1-scores exceeding 80% and Kendall's correlation coefficients above 0.5, demonstrating strong agreement with traditional scales. The study underscores the importance of the OCC-PAD-LDA model in improving screening accuracy and the significant impact of machine learning classifiers on the framework's performance. The emoLDAnet has the potential to support large-scale emotional well-being early screening and contribute to the advancement of mental health care.",

    "abstract": "The first ONTOX Hackathon of the EU Horizon 2020-funded ONTOX project was held on 21-23 April 2024 in Utrecht, The Netherlands (https://ontox-project.eu/hackathon/). This participatory event aimed to collectively advance innovation for human safety through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and hence significantly reduce reliance on animal-based testing. Expert scientists, industry leaders, young investigators, members of animal welfare organisations and academics alike, joined the hackathon. Eight teams were stimulated to find innovative solutions for challenging themes, that were selected based on previous discussions between stakeholders, namely: How to drive the use of AI in chemical risk assessment?; To predict or protect?; How can we secure human health and environmental protection at the same time?; and How can we facilitate the transition from animal tests to full implementation of human-relevant methods? The hackathon ended with a pitching contest, where the teams presented their solutions to a jury. The most promising solutions will be presented to regulatory authorities, industry, academia and non-governmental organisations at the next ONTOX Stakeholder Network meeting and taken up by the ONTOX project in order to tackle the above-mentioned challenges further. This report comprises two parts: The first part highlights some of the lessons learnt during the planning and execution of the hackathon; the second part presents the outcome of the ONTOX Hackathon, which resulted in several innovative and promising solutions based on New Approach Methodologies (NAMs), and outlines ONTOX's intended way forward.",

    "abstract": "Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) require prompt diagnosis through initial electrocardiograms (ECG), but ECG machines are not always accessible. Meanwhile, smartwatches offering ECG functionality have become widespread. This study evaluates the feasibility of an image-based ECG analysis artificial intelligence (AI) system with smartwatch-based multichannel, asynchronous ECG for diagnosing ACS.\nFifty-six patients with ACS and 15 healthy participants were included, and their standard 12-lead and smartwatch-based 9-lead ECGs were analyzed. The ACS group was categorized into ACS with acute total occlusion (ACS-O(+), culprit stenosis\u00a0\u2265\u00a099\u00a0%, n\u00a0=\u00a044) and ACS without occlusion (ACS-O(-), culprit stenosis 70\u00a0% to\u00a0<\u00a099\u00a0%, n\u00a0=\u00a012) based on coronary angiography. A deep learning-based AI-ECG tool interpreting 2-dimensional ECG images generated probability scores for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (qSTEMI), ACS (qACS), and myocardial injury (qMI: troponin I\u00a0>\u00a00.1\u00a0ng/mL).\nThe AI-driven qSTEMI, qACS, and qMI demonstrated correlation coefficients of 0.882, 0.874, and 0.872 between standard and smartwatch ECGs (all \nAI-ECG scores from standard and smartwatch-based ECGs showed high concordance with comparable diagnostic performance in differentiating ACS-O(+) and ACS-O(-). With increasing accessibility smartwatch accessibility, they may hold promise for aiding ACS diagnosis, regardless of location.",

    "abstract": "The current study focused on the development of crosslinked hydrogel microneedle patches (cHMNs) incorporating 5-FU-hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex-loaded flexible PEGylated liposomes (5-FU-HP\u03b2CD-loaded FP-LPs) to enhance treatment efficacy and reduce drug toxicity. The research utilized artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to design, optimize, and evaluate the cHMNs. Various AI models were assessed for accuracy, with metrics such as root mean square error and coefficient of determination guiding the selection of the most effective formulation. The physicochemical and mechanical properties, swelling behavior, in vitro skin permeation, and safety of the chosen cHMNs were tested. The results demonstrated that the 5-FU-HP\u03b2CD-loaded FP-LPs, stabilized with limonene, had an optimal particle size of 36.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.42\u00a0nm, narrow size distribution, and zeta potential of -10.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37\u00a0mV, with high encapsulation efficiency. The cHMNs exhibited a conical needle shape with sufficient mechanical strength to penetrate the stratum corneum up to approximately 467.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a065.12\u00a0\u03bcm. The system provided a high skin permeation rate of 41.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.26\u00a0% and significant drug accumulation in the skin. Additionally, the formulation was proven safe in cell culture while effectively inhibiting cancer growth and promoting apoptosis. This study highlights the potential of AI-enhanced cHMNs for delivering 5-FU-HP\u03b2CD-loaded FP-LPs transdermally, offering a promising new treatment avenue for non-melanoma skin cancers.",

    "abstract": "Drug design has always been pursuing techniques with time- and cost-benefits. Virtual screening, generally classified as ligand-based (LBVS) and structure-based (SBVS) approaches, could identify active compounds in the large chemical library to reduce time and cost. Owing to the intrinsic flaws and complementary nature of both approaches, continued efforts have been made to combine them to mitigate limitations. Meanwhile, the emergence of machine learning (ML) endows them with opportunities to leverage vast amounts of data to improve their defects. However, few discussions on how to merge ML-improved LBVS and SBVS have been conducted. Therefore, this review provides insights into combined usage of ML-improved LBVS and SBVS to enlighten medicinal chemists to utilize these joint strategies to lift the screening efficiency as well as AI professionals to design novel techniques.",

    "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a prevalent anxiety disorder marked by strong fear and avoidance of social scenarios. Early detection of SAD lays the foundation for the introduction of early interventions. However, due to the nature of social avoidance in social anxiety, the screening is challenging in the clinical setting. Classic questionnaires also bear the limitations of subjectivity, memory biases under repeated measures, and cultural influence. Thus, there exists an urgent need to develop a reliable and easily accessible tool to be widely used for social anxiety screening. Here, we developed the Social Artificial Intelligence Picture System (SAIPS) based on generative multi-modal foundation artificial intelligence (AI) models, containing a total of 279 social pictures and 118 control pictures. Social scenarios were constructed to represent core SAD triggers such as fear of negative evaluation, social interactions, and performance anxiety, mapping to specific dimensions of social anxiety to capture its multifaceted nature. Pictures devoid of social interactions were included as a control, aiming to reveal response patterns specific to social scenarios and to improve the system's precision in predicting social anxiety traits. Through laboratory and online experiments, we collected ratings on SAIPS from five dimensions. Machine learning results showed that ratings on SAIPS robustly reflected and predicted an individual's trait of social anxiety, especially social anxiety and arousal ratings. The prediction was reliable, even based on a short version with less than 30 pictures. Together, SAIPS may serve as a promising tool to support social anxiety screening and longitudinal predictions.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose considerable risks to global health, particularly through transmission in the food chain. Herein, we developed the artificial intelligence-driven quantification of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in food using a color-encoded multiplex hydrogel digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) system. The quenching of unincorporated amplification signal reporters (QUASR) was first introduced in multiplex digital LAMP. During amplification, primers labeled with different fluorophores were integrated into amplicons, generating color-specific fluorescent spots. While excess primers were quenched by complementary quenching probes. After amplification, fluorescent spots in red, green, and blue emerged in hydrogels, which were automatically identified and quantified using a deep learning model. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli in real fruit and vegetable samples were also successfully detected. This artificial intelligence-driven color-encoded multiplex hydrogel LAMP offers promising potential for the digital quantification of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the food industry.",

    "abstract": "Although the existing literature has explored the link between cognitive functioning and speech recognition in noise, the specific role of fluid intelligence still needs to be studied. Given the established association between working memory capacity (WMC) and fluid intelligence and the predictive power of WMC for speech recognition in noise, we aimed to elucidate the mediating role of fluid intelligence.\nWe used data from the n200 study, a longitudinal investigation into aging, hearing ability, and cognitive functioning. We analyzed two age-matched samples: participants with hearing aids and a group with normal hearing. WMC was assessed using the Reading Span task, and fluid intelligence was measured with Raven's Progressive Matrices. Speech recognition in noise was evaluated using Hagerman sentences presented to target 80% speech-reception thresholds in four-talker babble. Data were analyzed using mediation analysis to examine fluid intelligence as a mediator between WMC and speech recognition in noise.\nWe found a partial mediating effect of fluid intelligence on the relationship between WMC and speech recognition in noise, and that hearing status did not moderate this effect. In other words, WMC and fluid intelligence were related, and fluid intelligence partially explained the influence of WMC on speech recognition in noise.\nThis study shows the importance of fluid intelligence in speech recognition in noise, regardless of hearing status. Future research should use other advanced statistical techniques and explore various speech recognition tests and background maskers to deepen our understanding of the interplay between WMC and fluid intelligence in speech recognition.",

    "abstract": "The prognostic value of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is well-established. However, the direct relationship between image pixels and outcomes remains poorly understood. We hypothesised that leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse qualitative LGE images based on American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines could elucidate this relationship.\nWe collected retrospective CMR cases from a stress perfusion database, selecting LGE images comprising three long-axis views and 10 short-axis views. Clinical CMR reports served for annotation. We trained a multi-label convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict each AHA segment. Additionally, we transformed LGE image pixels into features, combined them with clinical data features, and trained a hybrid neural network (HNN) to predict mortality and ventricular arrhythmia. The dataset was divided into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets. Evaluation metrics included the area under the curve (AUC).\nThe total number of cases included was 2,740, with 218 patients experiencing positive mortality events (8%). The total number of cases with at least one AHA segment positive for LGE was 823 (30%), among which 111 (13%) experienced mortality events, and 84 (10%) had ventricular arrhythmia events. When assessing all segments combined, the most common cases were those classified as normal studies, with each AHA segment having a score of 0 (1,661 cases, 60.6%). The multi-label classifier demonstrated fair performance (AUC: 64%), whereas the cluster classifier did not yield any predictions (AUC: 53%, P<0.001). The mortality HNN achieved a satisfactory performance with an AUC of 77%, as did the ventricular arrhythmia HNN with an AUC of 75%.\nOur study demonstrates the feasibility of generating qualitative AHA LGE maps using AI. Furthermore, the prediction of mortality and ventricular arrhythmia using HNN represents a potent new approach for risk stratification in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).",

    "abstract": "Green technology and artificial intelligence (AI) are playing a positive role in reducing carbon emissions. Technology convergence, as a typical form of technological innovation, can expedite the realization of low-carbon goals through the outcomes of AI and green technology convergence (e.g., the smart home system and smart transportation system). To investigate the mechanisms within AI and green technologies that affect carbon emissions, this study extracts convergence features from convergence attributes and convergence networks, based on panel data from Chinese prefecture-level cities spanning the period from 1997 to 2019. By combining the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm and the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) value method, the study explains the individual effects and interaction effects of each feature on carbon emissions. The research findings reveal that technology convergence generality and innovation team scale have a significant impact on carbon emissions, with the latter exhibiting a U-shaped effect. Cities with high convergence network efficiency are found to influence suppressing carbon emissions positively. This study and its findings provide insights for policymakers to develop AI and green convergence technologies to reduce carbon emissions.",

    "abstract": "The goal is to provide an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methodology and appraisal tailored to clinicians and researchers in the headache field to facilitate interdisciplinary communications and research.\nThe application of AI to the study of headache and other healthcare challenges is growing rapidly. It is critical that these findings be accurately interpreted by headache specialists, but this can be difficult for non-AI specialists.\nThis paper is a narrative review of the fundamentals required to understand ML/AI headache research. Using guidance from key leaders in the field of headache medicine and AI, important references were reviewed and cited to provide a comprehensive overview of the terminology, methodology, applications, pitfalls, and bias of AI.\nWe review how AI models are created, common model types, methods for evaluation, and examples of their application to headache medicine. We also highlight potential pitfalls relevant when consuming AI research, and discuss ethical issues of bias, privacy and abuse generated by AI. Additionally, we highlight recent related research from across headache-related applications.\nMany promising current and future applications of ML and AI exist in the field of headache medicine. Understanding the fundamentals of AI will allow readers to understand and critically appraise AI-related research findings in their proper context. This paper will increase the reader's comfort in consuming AI/ML-based research and will prepare them to think critically about related research developments.",

    "abstract": "Validated scoring methods such as the Mayo Clinic Endoscopic Subscore (MCES) evaluate ulcerative colitis (UC) severity at the worst colon segment, without considering disease extent. We present the Ulcerative Colitis Severity Classification and Localized Extent (UC-SCALE) algorithm, which provides a comprehensive and automated evaluation of endoscopic severity and disease extent in UC.\nUlcerative Colitis Severity Classification and Localized Extent consists of 3 main elements: (1) a quality filter selecting readable images (frames) from colonoscopy videos, (2) a scoring system assigning an MCES to each readable frame, and (3) a camera localization algorithm assigning each frame to a location within the colon. Ulcerative Colitis Severity Classification and Localized Extent was trained and tested using 4326 sigmoidoscopy videos from phase III Etrolizumab clinical trials.\nThe high agreement between UC-SCALE and central reading at the level of the colon section (\ud835\udf05\u2005=\u20050.80), and the agreement between central and local reading (\ud835\udf05\u2005=\u20050.84), suggested a similar inter-rater agreement between UC-SCALE and experienced readers. Furthermore, UC-SCALE correlated with disease activity markers such calprotectin, C-reactive protein and patient-reported outcomes, Physician Global Assessment and Geboes Histologic scores (rs 0.40-0.55, ps\u2005<\u20050.0001). Finally, the value of using UC-SCALE was demonstrated by assessing individual endoscopic severity between baseline and induction.\nOur fully automated scoring system enables accurate, objective, and localized assessment of endoscopic severity in UC patients. In addition, we provide a topological representation of the score as a marker of disease severity that correlates highly with clinical metrics. Ulcerative Colitis Severity Classification and Localized Extent reproduces central reading and holds promise to enhance disease severity evaluation in both clinical trials and everyday practice.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate RETFound, a foundation artificial intelligence model, using a diverse clinical research dataset to assess its accuracy in detecting glaucoma using optic disc photographs. The model's accuracy for glaucoma detection was evaluated across race, age, glaucoma severity, and various training cycles (epochs) and dataset sample sizes.\nEvaluation of a diagnostic technology.\nThe study included 9787 color fundus photographs (CFPs) from 2329 participants of diverse race (White [73.4%], Black [13.6%] and other [13%]), disease severity (21.8% mild glaucoma, 7.2% moderate or advanced glaucoma, 60.3% not glaucoma, and 10.7% unreported), and age (48.8%\u00a0<60 years, 51.1%\u00a0>60 years) from the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study and the African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study. All fundus photographs were graded as \"Glaucomatous\" or \"Non-glaucomatous.\"\nThe study employed RETFound, a self-supervised learning model, to perform binary glaucoma classification. The diagnostic accuracy of RETFound was iteratively tested across different combinations of dataset sample sizes (50-2000 optic disc photographs), training cycles (5-50), and study subpopulations stratified by severity of glaucoma, age, and race).\nDiagnostic accuracy area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for classifying CFP as \"Glaucomatous\" or \"Non-glaucomatous.\"\nPerformance increased with larger training datasets and more training cycles, improving from 50 training images and 5 epochs (AUC: 0.52) to 2000 training images and 50 epochs (AUC: 0.86), with reduced gain in performance from approximately 500 and 1000 training images (AUC of 0.82 and 0.83, respectively). Performance was consistent across race and age for all training size and cycle number combinations: Black (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.87) vs. other (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.86), and >60 years (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.84) vs.\u00a0<60 years (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.87). Performance was significantly higher in patients with moderate to severe vs. mild glaucoma (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.95 vs. 0.84, respectively).\nGood RETFound performance was observed with a relatively small sample size of optic disc photographs used for fine-tuning and across differences in race and age. RETFound's ability to adapt across a range of CFP training conditions and populations suggests it is a promising tool to automate glaucoma detection in a variety of use cases.\nProprietary or commercial disclosure may be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) transforms nursing education, AI literacy is becoming a critical necessity for increasing the career potential and talent of nursing students. Additionally, fostering an innovation mindset promotes adaptability, creativity and openness to new approaches, further boosting students' confidence in their careers. However, few studies have examined the impact of these competencies on nursing students' career and talent self-efficacy, underscoring the need for further investigation.\nTo examine the moderating effect of AI literacy on the associations between an innovation mindset and nursing students' career and talent self-efficacy.\nCross-sectional study.\nData were collected from 596 nursing students who were enrolled in the College of Nursing at Alexandria University, Egypt. Three scales, namely, innovative thinking competencies, assessment of nonexperts' AI literacy and career and talent development self-efficacy, were used. Data were collected during the academic year 2023-2024. Hypotheses were tested via correlation and regression analyses.\nThis study revealed that nursing students had moderate levels of AI literacy, innovation mindset and career and talent self-efficacy. Nursing students' career and talent self-efficacy were significantly predicted by their innovative mindset and AI literacy. AI literacy significantly moderates the relationship between nursing students' innovation mindset and their career and talent self-efficacy, making it more positive.\nThis study highlighted that fostering awareness with AI-driven tools could cultivate innovative thinking among nursing students and augment confidence in their talents.\nThis study underscores that encouraging nursing talent and career aspirations requires the integration of AI literacy and innovative thinking as core competencies in nursing curricula.",

    "abstract": "Intelligence is defined as general mental capacity, which includes the abilities to reason, solve new problems, think abstractly, and learn quickly. Genetic factors explain a considerable fraction of inter-individual differences in intelligence. For many years, research on intelligence was limited to estimating the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors, without identifying any individual causal factors.\nThis review of the literature is based on pertinent original publications and reviews.\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown that certain gene loci are associated with intelligence, as well as with educational attainment, which is known to be correlated with intelligence. As each individual gene locus accounts for only a very small part of the variance in intelligence ( < 0.02%), so-called \"polygenic scores\" (PGS) have been calculated in which thousands of genetic variants are summarized together. On the basis of the largest GWAS performed to date, it is estimated that 7-15% of inter-individual differences in educational attainment and 7-10% in intelligence among persons of European descent can be explained by genetic factors. These genetic effects are partly indirect. At the same time, the relative importance of genetic factors in determining complex features such as intelligence and educational attainment must always be seen against the background of individual environmental conditions. In the presence of difficult social conditions, for example, the influence of genetic factors is typically lower.\nAt present, the polygenic scores generated from genome-wide association studies are primarily of scientific interest, yet they are becoming increasingly informative and valid for individual prediction. There is, therefore, a need for broad social discussion about their future use.",

    "abstract": "Teaching academic skills to students with intellectual disabilities can be a challenge for educators. This study explored the role of AI in the field of special education and provided a novel framework for educational integration of children with mild ID. Interestingly, it demonstrated that using AI-driven interventions could significantly improve academic skills and lead to better learning outcomes. This is crucial, as the holistic approach associated with the \"whole child\" model of education is prevalent due to the challenges students with ID face in social interactions typically involved in academic socialization.\nIntellectual disabilities (ID) are neurodevelopmental disorders that hinder learning, communication, and daily functioning. It negatively impacts learning of academic skills such as match and reading skills. Artificial intelligence (AI) may offer opportunities for these students to improve their academic performance.\nTo investigate the effectiveness of using AI in improving academic skills in a sample of seventy boys aged 9-12 with mild ID. They were enrolled into special education programs integrated into public schools in the Jeddah region of Saudi Arabia.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to an experimental and control group. The experimental group received ten 60-minute sessions twice weekly during five weeks, utilizing AI to personalize their academic skills activities. The control group received the educational program without the AI. All participants completed the Woodcock-Johnson IV-achievement test at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and one-month follow-up.\nThe experimental group demonstrated significant and sustained improvements in academic performance across all measured domains compared to the control group, with effect sizes ranging from moderate (\u03b7\u00b2 = 0.685) to large (\u03b7\u00b2 = 0.921), underscoring the efficacy of the intervention at post-intervention.\nThis study sheds light on the promise of applying AI tools in special education to respond to distinctive needs experienced by students with mild ID. Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of such interventions and their broader applications across diverse educational contexts for inclusive learning.",

    "abstract": "The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) provides a detailed classification system to facilitate accurate diagnosis and management of these conditions based on clinical criteria, imaging, and histopathological findings. This review aims to systematically present the state of the art in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications for the diagnosis, classification, and treatment planning of vascular anomalies affecting the soft tissues of the head and neck region.\nThe PubMed research identified 86 articles. After the initial screening of titles and abstracts, 75 studies were excluded due to the following reasons: irrelevance to the review's scope, unsuitable patient population, or inappropriate study design. 11 pertinent papers were included for the full-text screening. At the end of the full-text evaluation, 3 studies were considered eligible to be revised.\nConcerning the clinical, radiological, and histological diagnosis of vascular malformations, the three models reviewed seem to be promising in the classification of the different subtypes and the lesion's segmentation. The applications of AI achieved in the fields of radiology and dermatology are very promising. Any study did not provide a prospective validation cohort to verify the diagnostic performance but also to assess the usefulness of the model in clinical practice.\nWe can also affirm that a hybrid model, combining dermatological images, MRI or US images, and histological images, can be developed as a reliable AI tool, useful for clinicians from diagnosis to treatment decision-making and to supervise interventional procedures.",

    "abstract": "The structural characterization of new materials often poses immense challenges, especially when obtaining single-crystal structures is difficult, which is a common difficulty with covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Despite this, understanding the atomic structure is crucial as it provides insights into the arrangement and connectivity of organic building blocks, offering the opportunity to establish the correlation of structure-function relationships and unravel material properties. In this study, we present an approach for determining the structures of COFs, an integration of electron crystallography and computational intelligence (COF+). By applying established chemistry knowledge and employing particle swarm optimization (PSO) for trial structure generation, we overcome existing limitations, thus paving the way for advancements in COF structural determination. We have successfully implemented this technique on four representative COFs, each with unique characteristics. These examples underline the accuracy and efficacy of our approach in addressing the challenges tied to COF structural determination. Furthermore, our approach has revealed new structure candidates with different topologies or interpenetrations that are chemically feasible. This discovery demonstrates the capability of our algorithm in constructing trial COF structures without being influenced by topological factors. Our new approach to COF structure determination represents a significant advancement in the field and opens new avenues for exploring the properties and applications of COF materials.",

    "abstract": "The youth mental health crisis is exacerbated by limited access to care and resources. Mobile health (mHealth) platforms using predictive artificial intelligence (AI) can improve access and reduce barriers, enabling real-time responses and precision prevention. This systematic review evaluates predictive AI approaches in mHealth platforms for forecasting mental health symptoms among youth (13-25 years). We searched studies from Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and CENTRAL, to identify relevant studies. From 11 studies identified, three studies predicted multiple symptoms, with depression being the most common (63%). Most platforms used smartphones and 25% integrated wearables. Key predictors included smartphone usage (N=5), sleep metrics (N=6), and physical activity (N=5). Nuanced predictors like usage locations and sleep stages improved prediction. Logistic regression was most used (N=6), followed by Support Vector Machines (N=3) and ensemble methods (N=4). F-scores for anxiety and depression ranged from 0.73 to 0.84, and AUCs from 0.50 to 0.74. Stress models had AUCs of 0.68 to 0.83. Bayesian model selection and Shapley values enhanced robustness and interpretability. Barriers included small sample sizes, privacy concerns, missing data, and underrepresentation bias. Rigorous evaluation of predictive performance, generalizability, and user engagement is critical before mHealth platforms are integrated into psychiatric care.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a major global health challenge, accounting for nearly one in six deaths worldwide. Early diagnosis significantly improves survival rates and patient outcomes, yet in resource-limited settings, the scarcity of medical resources often leads to late-stage diagnosis. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with smartphone-based imaging systems offers a promising solution by providing portable, cost-effective, and widely accessible tools for early cancer detection. This paper introduces advanced smartphone-based imaging systems that utilize various imaging modalities for in vivo detection of different cancer types and highlights the advancements of AI for in vivo cancer detection in smartphone-based imaging. However, these compact smartphone systems face challenges like low imaging quality and restricted computing power. The use of advanced AI algorithms to address the optical and computational limitations of smartphone-based imaging systems provides promising solutions. AI-based cancer detection also faces challenges. Transparency and reliability are critical factors in gaining the trust and acceptance of AI algorithms for clinical application, explainable and uncertainty-aware AI breaks the black box and will shape the future AI development in early cancer detection. The challenges and solutions for improving AI accuracy, transparency, and reliability are general issues in AI applications, the AI technologies, limitations, and potentials discussed in this paper are applicable to a wide range of biomedical imaging diagnostics beyond smartphones or cancer-specific applications. Smartphone-based multimodal imaging systems and deep learning algorithms for multimodal data analysis are also growing trends, as this approach can provide comprehensive information about the tissue being examined. Future opportunities and perspectives of AI-integrated smartphone imaging systems will be to make cutting-edge diagnostic tools more affordable and accessible, ultimately enabling early cancer detection for a broader population.",

This review aims to identify mammography datasets (including digitised screen film mammography, 2D digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis) used in the development of AI technologies and present their characteristics, including their transparency of documentation, content, populations included and accessibility.\nMEDLINE and Google Dataset searches identified studies describing AI technology development and referencing breast imaging datasets up to June 2024. The characteristics of each dataset are summarised. In particular, the accompanying documentation was reviewed with a focus on diversity and inclusion of populations represented within each dataset.\n254 datasets were referenced in the literature search, 190 were privately held, 36 had barriers which prevented access, and 28 were accessible. Most datasets originated from Europe, East Asia and North America. There was poor reporting of individuals' attributes: 32 (12\u00a0%) datasets reported race or ethnicity; 76 (30\u00a0%) reported female/male categories with only one dataset explicitly defining whether these categories represented sex or gender attributes.\nThrough this review, we demonstrate gaps in the data landscape for mammography, highlighting poor representation globally. To ensure datasets in breast imaging have maximum utility for researchers, their characteristics should be documented and limitations of datasets, such as their representativeness of populations and settings, should inform scientific efforts to translate data-driven insights into technologies and discoveries.",

    "abstract": "Using a mediation model, this study examined the role of verbal intelligence and emotion knowledge in peer acceptance in a sample of Portuguese preschool children. Participants were 444 5-year-olds (214 girls and 230 boys). Emotion knowledge was assessed with the Portuguese version of the Assessment of Children's Emotion Skills. Verbal intelligence was measured with the Serial Rapid Naming and Semantic Verbal Fluency tests of the Battery of Phonological Assessment. The Social Status Interview was used to assess peer acceptance. We observed a significant indirect effect of verbal intelligence on peer acceptance mediated by emotion knowledge. These results show that cognitive skills, namely the verbal ones, closely and dynamically interact with emotion knowledge in explaining children's acceptance by their peers. The importance of promoting emotion knowledge and verbal intelligence is discussed, given their important contribution to social adjustment at a young age.",

    "abstract": "Patients with ALS often face difficulties expressing emotions due to impairments in facial expression, speech, body language, and cognitive function. This study aimed to develop non-invasive AI tools to detect and quantify emotional responsiveness in ALS patients, providing objective insights. Improved understanding of emotional responses could enhance patient-provider communication, telemedicine effectiveness, and clinical trial outcome measures.\nIn this preliminary exploratory study, fourteen patients with ALS had audio recordings performed during routine clinic visits while wearing a wireless pulse oximeter. Emotion-triggering questions related to symptom progression, breathing, mobility, feeding tube, and financial burden were randomly asked. The same questions were posed in separate psychiatric evaluations. Natural language processing (NLP) was used to analyze transcriptions, topic classifications, sentiment, and emotional states, combining pulse and speech data. AI-generated reports summarized the findings.\nPulse alterations consistent with emotional arousal were identified, with longer consultations and positive communication reducing pulse fluctuations. Financial concerns triggered the strongest emotional response, while discussions about breathing, mobility, and feeding tube increased anxiety. AI-generated reports prioritized patient concerns and streamlined documentation for providers.\nThis study introduces a novel approach to linking pulse and speech analysis to evaluate emotional responses in ALS patients. AI and affective computing provide valuable insights into emotional responses and disease progression, with potential applications for other neurological disorders. This approach could augment clinical trial outcomes by offering a more comprehensive view of patient well-being.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare delivery represents a transformative opportunity to enhance the lives of people living with disabilities. AI-driven technologies, such as assistive devices, conversational agents, and rehabilitation tools, can mitigate health disparities, improve diagnostic accuracy, and facilitate effective communication with healthcare providers, fostering more equitable healthcare environments. This commentary explores these applications while addressing the ethical challenges and limitations associated with AI deployment. Specific challenges, such as algorithmic bias, privacy risks with patient data, and the complexity of designing inclusive technologies, are discussed to provide a balanced perspective. For example, biased diagnostic tools may lead to inequitable care, and privacy breaches can compromise sensitive data. Key areas of focus include personalised care through AI-powered systems, the design of inclusive AI technologies incorporating continuous feedback loops and partnerships with advocacy groups, and the development of AI-enabled robotics for physical assistance. This commentary paper emphasises the importance of addressing these limitations alongside advancing ethical AI practices and ensuring continuous user involvement to meet the diverse needs of people living with disabilities, ultimately promoting greater independence and participation in society. Consequently, while AI holds transformative potential in advancing equitable and inclusive healthcare for people with disabilities, addressing ethical challenges, overcoming limitations, and fostering user-centred design are essential to fully realise its benefits and ensure these innovations promote autonomy, accessibility, and well-being.",

    "abstract": "Gliomas are the most common primary malignant intraparenchymal brain tumors with a dismal prognosis. With growing advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning models are being utilized for preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative neurological decision-making. We aimed to compile published literature in one format and evaluate the quality of level 1a evidence currently available.\nUsing PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted within databases including Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, and records with the application of artificial intelligence in glioma management were included. The AMSTAR 2 tool was used to assess the quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses by two independent researchers.\nFrom 812 studies, 23 studies were included. AMSTAR II appraised most reviews as either low or critically low in quality. Most reviews failed to deliver in critical domains related to the exclusion of studies, appropriateness of meta-analytical methods, and assessment of publication bias. Similarly, compliance was lowest in non-critical areas related to study design selection and the disclosure of funding sources in individual records. Evidence is moderate to low in quality in reviews on multiple neuro-oncological applications, low quality in glioma diagnosis and individual molecular markers like MGMT promoter methylation status, IDH, and 1p19q identification, and critically low in tumor segmentation, glioma grading, and multiple molecular markers identification.\nAMSTAR 2 is a robust tool to identify high-quality systematic reviews. There is a paucity of high-quality systematic reviews on the utility of artificial intelligence in glioma management, with some demonstrating critically low quality. Therefore, caution must be exercised when drawing inferences from these results.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the response and readability of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models to questions and recommendations proposed by the 2023 Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) guidelines for Chiari 1 malformation.\nThirteen questions were generated from CNS guidelines and asked to Perplexity, ChatGPT 4o, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. AI answers were divided into two categories, \"concordant\" and \"non-concordant,\" according to their alignment with current CNS guidelines. Non-concordant answers were sub-categorized as \"insufficient\" or \"over-conclusive.\" Responses were evaluated for readability via the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, SMOG (Simple Measure of Gobbledygook) Index, and Flesch Reading Ease test.\nPerplexity displayed the highest concordance rate of 69.2\u202f%, with non-concordant responses classified as 0\u202f% insufficient and 30.8\u202f% over-conclusive. ChatGPT 4o had the lowest concordance rate at 23.1\u202f%, with 0\u202f% insufficient and 76.9\u202f% over-conclusive classifications. Copilot showed a 61.5\u202f% concordance rate, with 7.7\u202f% insufficient and 30.8\u202f% over-conclusive. Gemini demonstrated a 30.8\u202f% concordance rate, with 7.7\u202f% insufficient and 61.5\u202f% as over-conclusive. Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores ranged from 14.48 (Gemini) to 16.48 (Copilot), Gunning Fog Index scores varied between 16.18 (Gemini) and 18.8 (Copilot), SMOG Index scores ranged from 16 (Gemini) to 17.54 (Copilot), and Flesch Reading Ease scores were low across all models, with Gemini showing the highest mean score of 21.3.\nPerplexity and Copilot emerged as the best-performing for concordance, while ChatGPT and Gemini displayed the highest over-conclusive rates. All responses showcased high complexity and difficult readability. While AI can be valuable in certain aspects of clinical practice, the low concordance rates show that AI should not replace clinician judgement.",

    "abstract": "Facial cues and expressions constitute a component of bodily responses that provide useful information about one's stress levels. According to the Facial Action Coding System, they can be modelled consistently in terms of fundamental facial muscle movements, called facial Action Units (AUs). This article investigates automatic acute stress recognition based on AUs using conventional Machine and Deep Learning techniques.\nWe created a new experimental dataset containing 58 participants performing 4 experimental phases and 11 stress and non-stress tasks in which the proposed system performs automatic facial AUs recognition. A computational feature selection method was employed to select a robust relevant AU combinations subset, which integrated with conventional Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods using the Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation algorithm to assess and model the implication of AUs under acute stress conditions. Ordinal modelling was used following the pairwise transformation to establish a common reference based on the personalized values of each participant.\nThe results indicate that, under acute stress conditions, participants' faces presented significantly more AUs and with greater intensity compared to neutral conditions. The most relevant combination of AUs to each stress type was computationally identified, ranked and selected. The mean yielded classification accuracy of stress condition versus neutral achieved across all experimental tasks was greater than 93%.\nThere are specific combinations of AUs that are relevant to the stress conditions of each experimental phase leading in each case to better neutral and stress separability.",

    "abstract": "The global burden of infectious diseases significantly affects mortality rates, with their varying symptoms making it challenging to assess and determine the severity of infections. Different countries face unique challenges related to these diseases. This study introduces innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI) based methodologies to enhance diagnostic accuracy through the analysis of medical imagery. It achieves this by developing a mathematical model capable of identifying potential infectious diseases from images, utilizing a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) framework. This cutting-edge approach combines Hypersoft Set (HSS) within a fuzzy context, pioneering in AI-driven diagnostic processes. The decision-making process might suggest actions such as isolation, quarantine in either domestic settings or specialized facilities, or admission to a hospital for further treatment. The use of visual aids in this research not only improves understanding but also highlights the effectiveness and significance of the proposed methods. The foundational theory and the results from this novel approach demonstrate its potential for widespread application in fields like machine learning, deep learning, and pattern recognition, indicating a significant stride in the fight against infectious diseases through advanced diagnostic techniques.",

    "abstract": "To review role of artificial intelligence in medicine.\nArtificial intelligence is continuing to revolutionize access, diagnosis, personalization of medicine, and treatment in healthcare. As a matter of fact, artificial intelligence contributed to the research that resulted in 2024 Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry, and economics. We are only at the tip of the iceberg in utilizing the abilities of artificial intelligence in medicine to improve accuracy of diagnoses and to enhance patient outcomes. Artificial intelligence has allowed better image analysis, prediction of progression of disease, personalized treatment plans, incorporations of genomics, and improved efficiency in care and follow-up utilizing home monitoring. In ocular health diagnosis and treatment of diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, glaucoma, corneal infections, and ectasia are only a few examples of how the power of artificial intelligence has been harnessed. Even though there are still challenges that need more work in the areas of patient privacy, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance, reliability, and development of regulatory frameworks, artificial intelligence has revolutionized and will continue to revolutionize medicine.\nArtificial intelligence is enhancing medical diagnosis and treatment, as well as access and prevention. Ocular imaging, visual outcome, optics, intraocular pressure, and data points will continue to see growth it the field of artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Engaging people in advance care planning is a challenging systemic problem that requires a social innovation approach and a conceptual framework to guide behavioural and social change efforts.\nTo identify stakeholders' perspectives on barriers to advance care planning engagement, options for overcoming these barriers, and user needs. The findings will inform the design of a health behaviour change intervention for engaging older adults (50+) in advance care planning.\nTo advance co-production and intervention design goals, the study used collective intelligence and scenario-based design methods.\nFollowing a systematic stakeholder analysis, 22 participants were recruited to three online collective intelligence sessions. The socioecological perspective informed framing of integrated findings and specifying factors at the individual, interpersonal, service, and system levels.\nIdentified barriers (n\u2009=\u2009109) were grouped into seven categories: (i) Psychological, (ii) Advance Care Planning Literacy, (iii) Interpersonal and Interprofessional, (iv) Service-Related, (v) Resources and Supports, (vi) Advance Care Planning Process and Methods, (vii) Cultural and Societal. Stakeholders generated 222 options for overcoming these barriers and specified 230 service user needs. The need to change perceptions of advance care planning, increase psychological readiness, and target advance care planning literacy was highlighted (individual-level). Timely, focused, and meaningful interaction between the key ACP actors must be facilitated using creative strategies (interpersonal-level). Need- and value-based services, including high quality resources, support systems, and infrastructure, should be co-designed (service-level). Cultural and societal transformation is required (system-level).\nFindings integration offered insight into the complexity of the design context and problem situation and identified directions for context-specific advance care planning intervention development.

    "abstract": "Surgical coaching has become more widespread and involves both technical and nontechnical skills. Emotional Intelligence (EI) is an important nontechnical skill and is associated with leadership skills, increased job satisfaction and superior nontechnical skills. This scoping review aimed to explore the use of EI as a component of surgical coaching.\nA scoping review was conducted to map the existing literature. Medline was searched from inception to May 2023. Eligible studies included surgical coaching, which incorporated aspects of emotional intelligence into the non-technical skills component.\n3206 studies were identified in the initial search. A total of 2117 articles remained after duplicates were removed. 2117 articles were screened by 2 authors (DA and MR). 32 studies were included in the full-text review, and 8 studies were included in the final analysis. Coaching was predominantly delivered by practicing surgeons, although 1 study used external professional coaches. Training methods for coaches vary widely, from short courses to extensive workshops, highlighting the lack of standardized training protocols within the field. The outcomes measured across studies were diverse, encompassing both technical and non-technical skills, as well as emotional intelligence constructs. Non-technical skills were predominantly assessed using the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) assessment tool, whereas other outcomes included burnout, resilience, and technical skills. Notably, none of the studies incorporated formal measurements of emotional intelligence, although aspects such as motivation, empathy, self-knowledge, and social skills were addressed in the coaching sessions.\nStandardization of coaching protocols and incorporation of emotional intelligence principles represent critical avenues for advancing the field and maximizing the benefits of coaching interventions in surgical practice.",

Coaching was predominantly delivered by practicing surgeons, although 1 study used external professional coaches. Training methods for coaches vary widely, from short courses to extensive workshops, highlighting the lack of standardized training protocols within the field. The outcomes measured across studies were diverse, encompassing both technical and non-technical skills, as well as emotional intelligence constructs. Non-technical skills were predominantly assessed using the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) assessment tool, whereas other outcomes included burnout, resilience, and technical skills. Notably, none of the studies incorporated formal measurements of emotional intelligence, although aspects such as motivation, empathy, self-knowledge, and social skills were addressed in the coaching sessions.",

    "abstract": "The popularization of generative artificial intelligence (AI), including Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), has raised concerns for the integrity of academic literature. This study asked the following questions: (1) Has the popularization of publicly available generative AI, such as ChatGPT, increased the prevalence of AI-generated orthopaedic literature? (2) Can AI detectors accurately identify ChatGPT-generated text? (3) Are there associations between article characteristics and the likelihood that it was AI generated?\nPubMed was searched across six major orthopaedic journals to identify articles received for publication after January 1, 2023. Two hundred and forty articles were randomly selected and entered into three popular AI detectors. Twenty articles published by each journal before the release of ChatGPT were randomly selected as negative control articles. 36 positive control articles (6 per journal) were created by altering 25%, 50%, and 100% of text from negative control articles using ChatGPT and were then used to validate each detector. The mean percentage of text detected as written by AI per detector was compared between pre-ChatGPT and post-ChatGPT release articles using independent t -test. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted using percentage AI-generated text per journal, article type (ie, cohort, clinical trial, review), and month of submission.\nOne AI detector consistently and accurately identified AI-generated text in positive control articles, whereas two others showed poor sensitivity and specificity. The most accurate detector showed a modest increase in the percentage AI detected for the articles received post release of ChatGPT (+1.8%, P = 0.01). Regression analysis showed no consistent associations between likelihood of AI-generated text per journal, article type, or month of submission.\nAs this study found an early, albeit modest, effect of generative AI on the orthopaedic literature, proper oversight will play a critical role in maintaining research integrity and accuracy. AI detectors may play a critical role in regulatory efforts, although they will require further development and standardization to the interpretation of their results.",

    "abstract": "Grading of blastocyst morphology is used routinely for embryo selection with good outcomes. A lot of effort has been placed in IVF to search for the prize of selecting the most viable embryo to transfer ('the golden fleece of embryology'). To improve on morphology alone, artificial intelligence (AI) has also become a tool of interest, with many retrospective studies being published with impressive prediction capabilities. Subsequently, AI has again raised expectations that this 'golden fleece of embryology' was once again within reach. A recent RCT however was not able to demonstrate non-inferiority using a deep learning algorithm 'iDAScore version 1' for clinical pregnancy rate when compared to standard morphology. Good blastocyst morphology has again proven itself as a high bar in predicting live birth. We should however not give up on the development of further approaches which may allow us to identify extra features of viable embryos that are not captured by morphology.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) represents an exciting and evolving technology that is increasingly being utilized across pain medicine. Large language models (LLMs) are one type of AI that has become particularly popular. Currently, there is a paucity of literature analyzing the impact that AI may have on trainee education. As such, we sought to assess the benefits and pitfalls that AI may have on pain medicine trainee education. Given the rapidly increasing popularity of LLMs, we particularly assessed how these LLMs may promote and hinder trainee education through a pilot quality improvement project.\nA comprehensive search of the existing literature regarding AI within medicine was performed to identify its potential benefits and pitfalls within pain medicine. The pilot project was approved by UPMC Quality Improvement Review Committee (#4547). Three of the most commonly utilized LLMs at the initiation of this pilot study - ChatGPT Plus, Google Bard, and Bing AI - were asked a series of multiple choice questions to evaluate their ability to assist in learner education within pain medicine.\nPotential benefits of AI within pain medicine trainee education include ease of use, imaging interpretation, procedural/surgical skills training, learner assessment, personalized learning experiences, ability to summarize vast amounts of knowledge, and preparation for the future of pain medicine. Potential pitfalls include discrepancies between AI devices and associated cost-differences, correlating radiographic findings to clinical significance, interpersonal/communication skills, educational disparities, bias/plagiarism/cheating concerns, lack of incorporation of private domain literature, and absence of training specifically for pain medicine education. Regarding the quality improvement project, ChatGPT Plus answered the highest percentage of all questions correctly (16/17). Lowest correctness scores by LLMs were in answering first-order questions, with Google Bard and Bing AI answering 4/9 and 3/9 first-order questions correctly, respectively. Qualitative evaluation of these LLM-provided explanations in answering second- and third-order questions revealed some reasoning inconsistencies (e.g., providing flawed information in selecting the correct answer).\nAI represents a continually evolving and promising modality to assist trainees pursuing a career in pain medicine. Still, limitations currently exist that may hinder their independent use in this setting. Future research exploring how AI may overcome these challenges is thus required. Until then, AI should be utilized as supplementary tool within pain medicine trainee education and with caution.",

    "abstract": "Recent healthcare advancements highlight the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) - and especially, among its subfields, Machine Learning (ML) - in enhancing Breast Cancer (BC) clinical care, leading to improved patient outcomes and increased radiologists' efficiency. While medical imaging techniques have significantly contributed to BC detection and diagnosis, their synergy with AI algorithms has consistently demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy, reduced False Positives (FPs), and enabled personalized treatment strategies. Despite the burgeoning enthusiasm for leveraging AI for early and effective BC clinical care, its widespread integration into clinical practice is yet to be realized, and the evaluation of AI-based health technologies in terms of health and economic outcomes remains an ongoing endeavor.\nThis scoping review aims to investigate AI (and especially ML) applications that have been implemented and evaluated across diverse clinical tasks or decisions in breast imaging and to explore the current state of evidence concerning the assessment of AI-based technologies for BC clinical care within the context of Health Technology Assessment (HTA).\nWe conducted a systematic literature search following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) checklist in PubMed and Scopus to identify relevant studies on AI (and particularly ML) applications in BC detection and diagnosis. We limited our search to studies published from January 2015 to October 2023. The Minimum Information about CLinical Artificial Intelligence Modeling (MI-CLAIM) checklist was used to assess the quality of AI algorithms development, evaluation, and reporting quality in the reviewed articles. The HTA Core Model\u00ae was also used to analyze the comprehensiveness, robustness, and reliability of the reported results and evidence in AI-systems' evaluations to ensure rigorous assessment of AI systems' utility and cost-effectiveness in clinical practice.\nOf the 1652 initially identified articles, 104 were deemed eligible for inclusion in the review. Most studies examined the clinical effectiveness of AI-based systems (78.84%, n= 82), with one study focusing on safety in clinical settings, and 13.46% (n=14) focusing on patients' benefits. Of the studies, 31.73% (n=33) were ethically approved to be carried out in clinical practice, whereas 25% (n=26) evaluated AI systems legally approved for clinical use. Notably, none of the studies addressed the organizational implications of AI systems in clinical practice. Of the 104 studies, only two of them focused on cost-effectiveness analysis, and were analyzed separately. The average percentage scores for the first 102 AI-based studies' quality assessment based on the MI-CLAIM checklist criteria were 84.12%, 83.92%, 83.98%, 74.51%, and 14.7% for study design, data and optimization, model performance, model examination, and reproducibility, respectively. Notably, 20.59% (n=21) of these studies relied on large-scale representative real-world breast screening datasets, with only 10.78% (n =11) studies demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the evaluated AI systems.\nIn bridging the gap between cutting-edge developments and seamless integration of AI systems into clinical workflows, persistent challenges encompass data quality and availability, ethical and legal considerations, robustness and trustworthiness, scalability, and alignment with existing radiologists' workflow. These hurdles impede the synthesis of comprehensive, robust, and reliable evidence to substantiate these systems' clinical utility, relevance, and cost-effectiveness in real-world clinical workflows. Consequently, evaluating AI-based health technologies through established HTA methodologies becomes complicated. We also highlight potential significant influences on AI systems' effectiveness of various factors, such as operational dynamics, organizational structure, the application context of AI systems, and practices in breast screening or examination reading of AI support tools in radiology. Furthermore, we emphasize substantial reciprocal influences on decision-making processes between AI systems and radiologists. Thus, we advocate for an adapted assessment framework specifically designed to address these potential influences on AI systems' effectiveness, mainly addressing system-level transformative implications for AI systems rather than focusing solely on technical performance and task-level evaluations.",

Artificial intelligence is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and solve complicated problems. In this article, we address current and likely future applications for AI to be applied to diabetes and its complications, including pharmacoadherence to therapy, diagnosis of hypoglycemia, diabetic eye disease, diabetic kidney diseases, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic foot ulcers, and heart failure in diabetes.Artificial intelligence is advantageous because it can handle large and complex datasets from a variety of sources. With each additional type of data incorporated into a clinical picture of a patient, the calculation becomes increasingly complex and specific. Artificial intelligence is the foundation of emerging medical technologies; it will power the future of diagnosing diabetes complications.",

    "abstract": "The bi-annual international congress on autoimmunity is a huge opportunity for the medical community to discuss the latest updates in the field. During the 14th congress 2024 (AUTO14) in Ljubljana, artificial intelligence (AI) occupied special attention due to its recent and ongoing unequivocal role in various medical fields including autoimmunity. For instance, through a challenging debate between world-experts and the most popular AI bot used (ChatGPT), several clinical cases including a case of vasculitis were discussed in the plenary sessions. ChatGPT agreed with the clinical decisions made by the experts nevertheless, the bot added additional aspects related to the specific case. In this regard, ChatGPT emphasized the need for osteoporosis prophylaxis in a patient planned to be treated with systemic steroids for a long time. Furthermore, AUTO14 included the newest updates on most autoimmune disorders, distributed among tens of sessions. Among others, infection and autoimmunity, the sequalae of the pandemic of COVID-19, as well as COVID-19 vaccines were discussed as well. Due to the high numbers of the works presented, and for ensuring that important updates are not missed; we divided our paper into sections. The subtitles throughout the paper correspond to different sessions of the congress, all presenting new updates in the field. A figure aiding in navigating throughout the paper was also provided.",

    "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Intelligent Learning Models (ILMs) in healthcare has transformed the field, offering precise diagnostics, remote monitoring, personalized treatment, and more. Cardioneurological disorders (CD), affecting the cardiovascular and neurological systems, present significant diagnostic and management challenges. Traditional testing methods often lack sensitivity and specificity, leading to delayed or inaccurate diagnoses. AI-driven ILMs trained on large datasets offer promise for accurate identification and prediction of CD by analyzing complex data patterns. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies reviewing AI applications for the diagnosis of CD and inter related disorders. This paper comprehensively reviews existing integrated solutions involving AI and ILMs in CD, examining their clinical manifestations, epidemiology, diagnostic challenges, and therapeutic considerations. The study examines recent research on CD, reviews AI-driven models' landscape, evaluates existing models, addresses practical considerations, and outlines future research directions. Through this work, we aim to provide insights into the transformative potential of AI-driven ILMs in improving clinical practice and patient outcomes for CD.",

    "abstract": "Accurate image interpretation is essential in the field of radiology to the healthcare team in order to provide optimal patient care. This article discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) confidence levels to enhance the accuracy and dependability of its radiological diagnoses. The current advances in AI technologies have changed how radiologists and clinicians make the diagnoses of pathological conditions such as aneurysms, hemorrhages, pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, and particularly fractures. To enhance the utility of these AI models, radiologists need a more comprehensive understanding of the model's levels of confidence and certainty behind the results they produce. This allows radiologists to make more informed decisions that have the potential to drastically change a patient's clinical management. Several AI models, especially those utilizing deep learning models (DL) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated significant potential in identifying subtle findings in medical imaging that are often missed by radiologists. It is necessary to create standardized levels of confidence metrics in order for AI systems to be relevant and reliable in the clinical setting. Incorporating AI into clinical practice does have certain obstacles like the need for clinical validation, concerns regarding the interpretability of AI system results, and addressing confusion and misunderstandings within the medical community. This study emphasizes the importance of AI systems to clearly convey their level of confidence in radiological diagnosis. This paper highlights the importance of conducting research to establish AI confidence level metrics that are limited to a specific anatomical region or lesion type. KEY POINT OF THE VIEW: Accurate fracture diagnosis relies on radiologic certainty, where Artificial intelligence (AI), especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning (DL), shows promise in enhancing X-ray interpretation amidst a shortage of radiologists. Overcoming integration challenges through improved AI interpretability and education is crucial for widespread acceptance and better patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Performing simulated snoring (SS) is a commonly used method to evaluate the source of snoring in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). SS sounds is considered as a potential biomarker for OSA. SS sounds can be easily recorded, which is a cost-effective method for prescreening purposes.\nThis study aimed to validate the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) models using SS sounds for OSA diagnosis.\nAll participants underwent full-night polysomnography (PSG) monitoring at the sleep center. SS sounds of the participants were recorded during the laryngoscopy procedure. The audio data were processed via Python, and relevant features were extracted. OSA diagnostic models were developed using three machine learning (ML) algorithms and one deep learning (DL) algorithm. The diagnostic performance was evaluated by multiple indicators.\nA total of 465 participants were included. For the support vector machine algorithm, the accuracy values at apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) levels of 5, 15, and 30 per hour were 0.914, 0.887, and 0.807, respectively. For the K-nearest neighbor algorithm, the accuracy values at AHI levels of 5, 15, and 30 per hour were 0.896, 0.872, and 0.756, respectively. For the random forest algorithm, the accuracy values at AHI levels of 5, 15, and 30 per hour were 0.905, 0.881, and 0.804, respectively. For the audio spectrogram transformer algorithm, the accuracy values at AHI levels of 5, 15, and 30 per hour were 0.926, 0.887, and 0.830, respectively.\nOur study demonstrates that DL models can effectively screen and identify OSA with commendable performance. In addition, the identification ability of the DL models was better than that of any of the ML models.",

    "abstract": "To summarize the current evidence on the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc assessment and TMJ internal derangement diagnosis in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images.\nStudies were gathered by searching 5 electronic databases and partial grey literature up to May 27, 2024. Studies in humans using AI algorithms to detect or diagnose internal derangements in MRI images were included. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic of Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) and a proposed checklist for dental AI studies.\nThirteen studies were included in this systematic review. Most of the studies assessed disc position. One study assessed disc perforation. A high heterogeneity related to the patient selection domain was found between the studies. The studies used a variety of AI approaches and performance metrics with CNN-based models being the most used. A high performance of AI models compared to humans was reported with accuracy ranging from 70% to 99%.\nThe integration of AI, particularly deep learning, in TMJ MRI, shows promising results as a diagnostic-assistance tool to segment TMJ structures and classify disc position. Further studies exploring more diverse and multicentre data will improve the validity and generalizability of the models before being implemented in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Pneumothorax (PTX) is a common clinical urgency, its diagnosis is usually performed on chest radiography (CXR), and it presents a setting where artificial intelligence (AI) methods could find terrain in aiding radiologists in facing increasing workloads. Hence, the purpose of our study was to test an AI system for the detection of PTX on CXR examinations, to review its diagnostic performance in such setting alongside that of reading radiologists.\nWe retrospectively ran an AI system on CXR examinations of patients who were imaged for the suspicion of PTX, and who also underwent computed tomography (CT) within the same day, the latter being used as reference standard. The performance of the proposed AI system was compared to that of reading radiologists, obtained from CXR reports.\nOverall, the AI system achieved an accuracy of 74\u00a0% (95%CI 68-79\u00a0%), with a sensitivity of 66\u00a0% (95%CI 59-73\u00a0%) and a specificity of 93\u00a0% (95%CI 85-97\u00a0%). Human readers displayed a comparable accuracy (77\u00a0%, 95%CI 71-82\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.355), with higher sensitivity (73\u00a0%, 95%CI 66-79\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.040), albeit lower specificity (85\u00a0%, 95%CI 75-91\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.034). The performance of AI was influenced by patient positioning at CXR (p\u00a0=\u00a00.040).\nThe proposed tool could represent an aid to radiologists in detecting PTX, improving specificity. Further improvement with training on more challenging cases may pave the way for its use as a screening or standalone tool.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning can extract predictive and prognostic biomarkers from histopathology whole slide images, but its interpretability remains elusive.\nWe develop and validate MoPaDi (Morphing histoPathology Diffusion), which generates counterfactual mechanistic explanations. MoPaDi uses diffusion autoencoders to manipulate pathology image patches and flip their biomarker status by changing the morphology. Importantly, MoPaDi includes multiple instance learning for weakly supervised problems. We validate our method on four datasets classifying tissue types, cancer types within different organs, center of slide origin, and a biomarker - microsatellite instability. Counterfactual transitions were evaluated through pathologists' user studies and quantitative cell analysis.\nMoPaDi achieves excellent image reconstruction quality (multiscale structural similarity index measure 0.966-0.992) and good classification performance (AUCs 0.76-0.98). In a blinded user study for tissue-type counterfactuals, counterfactual images were realistic (63.3-73.3% of original images identified correctly). For other tasks, pathologists identified meaningful morphological features from counterfactual images.\nMoPaDi generates realistic counterfactual explanations that reveal key morphological features driving deep learning model predictions in histopathology, improving interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Chatbots are artificial intelligence (AI) programs designed to simulate conversations with humans that present opportunities and challenges in scientific research. Despite growing clarity from publishing organisations on the use of AI chatbots, researchers' perceptions remain less understood. In this international cross-sectional survey, we aimed to assess researchers' attitudes, familiarity, perceived benefits, and limitations related to AI chatbots. Our online survey was open from July 9 to Aug 11, 2023, with 61\u2009560 corresponding authors identified from 122\u2009323 articles indexed in PubMed. 2452 (4\u00b70%) provided responses and 2165 (94\u00b75%) of 2292 who met eligibility criteria completed the survey. 1161 (54\u00b70%) of 2149 respondents were male and 959 (44\u00b76%) were female. 1294 (60\u00b75%) of 2138 respondents were familiar with AI chatbots, and 945 (44\u00b75%) of 2125 had previously used AI chatbots in research. Only 244 (11\u00b74%) of 2137 reported institutional training on AI tools, and 211 (9\u00b79%) of 2131 noted institutional policies on AI chatbot use. Despite mixed opinions on the benefits, 1428 (69\u00b77%) of 2048 expressed interest in further training. Although many valued AI chatbots for reducing administrative workload (1299 [66\u00b79%] of 1941), there was insufficient understanding of the decision making process (1484 [77\u00b72%] of 1923). Overall, this study highlights substantial interest in AI chatbots among researchers, but also points to the need for more formal training and clarity on their use.",

    "abstract": "Expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of medicine is changing the paradigm of clinical practice at a rapid pace. Incorporation of AI in medicine offers new tools as well as challenges, and physicians and learners need to adapt to assimilate AI into practice and education. AI can expedite early diagnosis and intervention with real-time multimodal monitoring. AI assistants can decrease the clerical burden of heath care improving the productivity of work force while mitigating burnout. There are still no regulatory parameters for use of AI and regulatory framework is needed for the implementation of AI systems in medicine to ensure transparency, accountability, and equitable access.",

    "abstract": "The \"EU Artificial Intelligence Act\" sets a framework for the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in Europe. As a legal assessment reveals, AI applications in water supply systems are categorised as high-risk AI if a failure in the AI application results in a significant impact on physical infrastructure or supply reliability. The use case of water demand forecasts with AI for automatic tank operation is for example categorised as high-risk AI and must fulfil specific requirements regarding model transparency (traceability, explainability) and technical robustness (accuracy, reliability). To this end, six widely established machine learning models, including both transparent and opaque models, are applied to different datasets for daily water demand forecasting and the requirements regarding model accuracy, transparency and technical robustness are systematically evaluated for this use case. Opaque models generally achieve higher prediction accuracy compared to transparent models due to their ability to capture the complex relationship between parameters like for example weather data and water demand. However, this also makes them vulnerable to deviations and irregularities in weather forecasts and historical water demand. In contrast, transparent models rely mainly on historical water demand data for the utilised dataset and are less influenced by weather data, making them more robust against various data irregularities. In summary, both transparent and opaque models can fulfil the requirements regarding explainability but differ in their level of transparency and robustness to input errors. The choice of model depends also on the operator's preferences and the context of the application.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key molecules involved in cellular signaling and are attractive targets for pharmacological intervention. This chapter is designed to explore the range of algorithms used to predict GPCRs' activation states, while also examining the pharmaceutical implications of these predictions. Our primary objective is to show how artificial intelligence (AI) is key in GPCR research to reveal the intricate dynamics of activation and inactivation processes, shedding light on the complex regulatory mechanisms of this vital protein family. We describe several computational strategies that leverage diverse structural data from the Protein Data Bank, molecular dynamic simulations, or ligand-based methods to predict the activation states of GPCRs. We demonstrate how the integration of AI into GPCR research not only enhances our understanding of their dynamic properties but also presents immense potential for driving pharmaceutical research and development, offering promising new avenues in the search for newer, better therapeutic agents.",

Although the potential benefits are evident, AI integration into neurosurgical workflows requires discussions around ethical regulations, cybersecurity, privacy concerns, and data and algorithm ownership.",

    "abstract": "Some of the early applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for food safety appear to be intended for use at the level of manufacturing and distribution. Artificial intelligence applications to facilitate foodborne illness outbreak investigations, development of HACCP plans, and food safety root cause analyses at the retail level are needed. For example, the interview form in the International Association for Food Protection booklet, Procedures to Investigate Foodborne Illness, could be filled out by humans, but much of the rest of the forms could be completed by artificial intelligence applications. Humans would still have to do the environmental assessments. Most AI applications to date have consisted of pattern identification. Pattern recognition applications may not be capable of assisting in all the proposed retail applications, but it would not be helpful to propose these retail applications without offering a possible path forward. Progress in the proposed directions may require the development of more robust artificial intelligence based on cognitive models. Because this paradigm shift is less familiar to food safety professionals, a comparison between pattern recognition algorithms and cognitive models is offered. An explanation of cognitive models is included to raise awareness of this approach.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases remain a global health challenge, necessitating innovative approaches for their early diagnosis and effective treatment. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare, offering promising solutions to address this challenge. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the pivotal role AI can play in the early diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. It explores how AI-driven diagnostic tools, including machine learning algorithms, deep learning, and image recognition systems, enhance the accuracy and efficiency of disease detection and surveillance. Furthermore, it delves into the potential of AI to predict disease outbreaks, optimise treatment strategies, and personalise interventions based on individual patient data and how AI can be used to gear up the drug discovery and development (D3) process.The ethical considerations, challenges, and limitations associated with the integration of AI in infectious disease management are also examined. By harnessing the capabilities of AI, healthcare systems can significantly improve their preparedness, responsiveness, and outcomes in the battle against infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "From 8% to 28% of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) experience recurrence, complicating risk stratification and treatment. We previously identified an inflammatory molecular subtype of PTC associated with poor prognosis. Based on this subtype, we aimed to develop and validate a noninvasive radiomic signature to predict prognosis and treatment response in patients with PTC.\nWe collected preoperative ultrasound images from two large independent centers (n = 2,506) to develop and validate a deep learning radiomics signature of inflammation (DLRI) for predicting the inflammatory subtype of PTC, including its correlation with prognosis and anti-inflammatory traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment. Training set 1 (n = 64) and internal validation set 2 (n = 1,108) were from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital. External validation sets 1 (n = 76) and 2 (n = 1,258) were from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center.\nWe developed a DLRI to accurately predict PTC's inflammatory subtype (AUC = 0.97 in training set 1 and AUC = 0.82 in external validation set 1). High-risk DLRI was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival in the first cohort [HR = 16.49, 95% confidence interval (CI), 7.92-34.35, P < 0.001] and second cohort (HR = 5.42, 95% CI, 3.67-8.02, P < 0.001). The DLRI independently predicted disease-free survival, irrespective of clinicopathologic variables (P < 0.001 for all). Furthermore, patients with high-risk DLRI were likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory TCM treatment (HR = 0.19, 95% CI, 0.06-0.55, P = 0.002), whereas those with low-risk DLRI did not.\nDLRI is a reliable noninvasive tool for evaluating prognosis and guiding anti-inflammatory TCM treatment in patients with PTC. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

Furthermore, patients with high-risk DLRI were likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory TCM treatment (HR = 0.19, 95% CI, 0.06-0.55, P = 0.002), whereas those with low-risk DLRI did not.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for precision medicine in cancer patients, radiogenomics emerges as a promising frontier. Radiogenomics is originally defined as a methodology for associating gene expression information from high-throughput technologies with imaging phenotypes. However, with advancements in medical imaging, high-throughput omics technologies, and artificial intelligence, both the concept and application of radiogenomics have significantly broadened. In this review, the history of radiogenomics is enumerated, related omics technologies, the five basic workflows and their applications across tumors, the role of AI in radiogenomics, the opportunities and challenges from tumor heterogeneity, and the applications of radiogenomics in tumor immune microenvironment. The application of radiogenomics in positron emission tomography and the role of radiogenomics in multi-omics studies is also discussed. Finally, the challenges faced by clinical transformation, along with future trends in this field is discussed.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence AI-supported applications become integral to web-based information-seeking, assessing their impact on healthy nutrition and weight management during the antenatal period is crucial.\nThis study was conducted to evaluate both the quality and semantic similarity of responses created by AI models to the most frequently asked questions about healthy nutrition and weight management during the antenatal period, based on existing clinical knowledge.\nIn this study, a cross-sectional assessment design was used to explore data from 3 AI models (GPT-4, MedicalGPT, Med-PaLM). We directed the most frequently asked questions about nutrition during pregnancy, obtained from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to each model in a new and single session on October 21, 2023, without any prior conversation. Immediately after, instructions were given to the AI models to generate responses to these questions. The responses created by AI models were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) scale. Additionally, to assess the semantic similarity between answers to 31 pregnancy nutrition-related frequently asked questions sourced from the ACOG and responses from AI models we evaluated cosine similarity using both WORD2VEC and BioLORD-2023.\nMed-PaLM outperformed GPT-4 and MedicalGPT in response quality (mean\u00a0=\u00a03.93), demonstrating superior clinical accuracy over both GPT-4 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) and MedicalGPT (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). GPT-4 had higher quality than MedicalGPT (p\u00a0=\u00a00.027). The semantic similarity between ACOG and Med-PaLM is higher with WORD2VEC (0.92) compared to BioLORD-2023 (0.81), showing a difference of +0.11. The similarity scores for ACOG-MedicalGPT and ACOG-GPT-4 are similar across both models, with minimal differences of -0.01. Overall, WORD2VEC has a slightly higher average similarity (0.82) than BioLORD-2023 (0.79), with a difference of +0.03.\nDespite the superior performance of Med-PaLM, there is a need for further evidence-based research and improvement in the integration of AI in healthcare due to varying AI model performances.",

    "abstract": "Computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) offer the opportunity to rapidly and accurately interpret standardized x-rays. We trained and validated a machine learning tool that identified key reference points and determined glenoid retroversion and glenohumeral relationships on axillary radiographs.\nStandardized pre and post arthroplasty axillary radiographs were manually annotated locating six reference points and used to train a computer vision model that could identify these reference points without human guidance. The model then used these reference points to determine humeroglenoid alignment in the anterior to posterior direction and glenoid version. The model's accuracy was tested on a separate test set of axillary images not used in training, comparing its reference point locations, alignment and version to the corresponding values assessed by two surgeons.\nOn the test set of pre- and post-operative images not used in the training process, the model was able to rapidly identify all six reference point locations to within a mean of 2\u00a0mm of the surgeon-assessed points. The mean variation in alignment and version measurements between the surgeon assessors and the model was similar to the variation between the two surgeon assessors.\nThis article reports on the development and validation of a computer vision/artificial intelligence model that can independently identify key landmarks and determine the glenohumeral relationship and glenoid version on axillary radiographs. This observer-independent approach has the potential to enable efficient human observer independent assessment of shoulder radiographs, lessening the burden of manual x-ray interpretation and enabling scaling of these measurements across large numbers of patients from multiple centers so that pre and postoperative anatomy can be correlated with patient reported clinical outcomes.\nLevel III Study of Diagnostic Test.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), a field within computer science, uses algorithms to replicate human intelligence tasks such as pattern recognition, decision-making and problem-solving through complex datasets. In endodontics, AI is transforming diagnosis and treatment by applying deep learning algorithms, notably convolutional neural networks, which mimic human brain function to analyse two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) data.\nThis article provides an overview of AI applications in endodontics, evaluating its use in 2D and 3D imaging and examining its role as a beneficial tool or potential challenge.\nThrough a narrative review, the article explores AI's use in 2D and 3D imaging modalities, discusses their limitations and examines future directions in the field.\nAI significantly enhances endodontic practice by improving diagnostic accuracy, workflow efficiency, and treatment planning. In 2D imaging, AI excels at detecting periapical lesions on both periapical and panoramic radiographs, surpassing expert radiologists in accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. AI also accurately detects and classifies radiolucent lesions, such as radicular cysts and periapical granulomas, matching the precision of histopathology analysis. In 3D imaging, AI automates the segmentation of fine structures such as pulp chambers and root canals on cone-beam computed tomography scans, thereby supporting personalized treatment planning. However, a significant limitation highlighted in some studies is the reliance on in vitro or ex vivo datasets for training AI models. These datasets do not replicate the complexities of clinical environments, potentially compromising the reliability of AI applications in endodontics.\nDespite advancements, challenges remain in dataset variability, algorithm generalization, and ethical considerations such as data security and privacy. Addressing these is essential for integrating AI effectively into clinical practice and unlocking its transformative potential in endodontic care. Integrating radiomics with AI shows promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and predictive analytics, potentially enabling automated decision support systems to enhance treatment outcomes and patient care.\nAlthough AI enhances endodontic capabilities through advanced imaging analyses, addressing current limitations and fostering collaboration between AI developers and dental professionals are essential. These efforts will unlock AI's potential to achieve more predictable and personalized treatment outcomes in endodontics, ultimately benefiting both clinicians and patients alike.",

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence is a technology that provides greater connectivity with people through conversational bots (\"chatbots\"). These bots can engage in dialogue using natural language indistinguishable from humans and are a potential source of information for patients. The aim of this study is to examine the performance of these bots in solving specific issues related to orthopedic surgery and traumatology using questions from the Spanish MIR exam between 2008 and 2023.\nThree \"chatbot\" models (ChatGPT, Bard and Perplexity) were analyzed by answering 114 questions from the MIR. Their accuracy was compared, the readability of their responses was evaluated, and their dependence on logical reasoning and internal and external information was examined. The type of error was also evaluated in the failures.\nChatGPT obtained 72.81% correct answers, followed by Perplexity (67.54%) and Bard (60.53%). Bard provides the most readable and comprehensive responses. The responses demonstrated logical reasoning and the use of internal information from the question prompts. In 16 questions (14%), all three applications failed simultaneously. Errors were identified, including logical and information failures.\nWhile conversational bots can be useful in resolving medical questions, caution is advised due to the possibility of errors. Currently, they should be considered as a developing tool, and human opinion should prevail over generative artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is growing quickly and has already had a significant impact on the practice of orthodontics. This study aimed to explore the degree to which the study and use of AI have been integrated into accredited postgraduate orthodontic programs in North America.\nAn anonymous electronic survey was sent to each of North America's 74 orthodontic residency programs, requesting information from either the program director or department chair. Data were collected and analyzed using SPSS (version 28; IBM, Armonk, NY) and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, Wash).\nForty-one valid surveys were analyzed. Among the respondents, 56.1% had implemented or planned to implement AI instruction into their program. Among those who reported using this technology, 60.9% indicated that they have applied these principles for research purposes. Most respondents (87.8%) noted that they have not developed seminars and/or AI training to be included in their curriculum, whereas residents in 17.1% of respondent programs have advocated for these modifications. Lack of expertise and availability in the schedule (71.4%) are common challenges associated with the dearth of curriculum changes. Most programs (68.3%) encouraged their residents to attend continuing education for AI fundamentals, while 75.6% reported that they do not encourage their residents to use AI for patient care, research, or didactic assignments. Several programs (68.3%) reported not updating their academic manuals and syllabi with new AI policies, nor have they installed new AI detection software (80.5%).\nMore than half of orthodontic residencies have implemented AI into their program in some capacity. The continual advancements of AI algorithms will require modifications to orthodontic residency programs. AI-related education should be implemented into academic curricula to provide residents with the tools necessary to thrive in an AI-driven practice.",

Although we are in an early phase at the clinical level, there is an exponential increase in the number of scientific articles that use AI (discriminative and generative) in their methodology. According to the current situation, we may be in an \"AI bubble\" stage; requiring filters and tools to evaluate its application, based on the quality and evidence provided. In this sense, initiatives have been developed to determine standards and guidelines for the use of discriminative AI (CONSORT AI, STARD AI and others), and more recently for generative AI (the CHART collaborative).

    "abstract": "There is a need for clinically actionable prognostic and predictive tools to guide the management of oligometastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (omCSPC).\nThis is a multicenter retrospective study to assess the prognostic and predictive performance of a multimodal artificial intelligence biomarker (MMAI; the ArteraAI Prostate Test) in men with omCSPC (n\u00a0=\u00a0222). The cohort also included 51 patients from the STOMP and ORIOLE phase 2 clinical trials which randomized patients to observation versus metastasis-directed therapy (MDT). MMAI scores were computed from digitized histopathology slides and clinical variables. Overall survival (OS) and time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (TTCRPC) were assessed for the entire cohort from time of diagnosis. Metastasis free survival (MFS) was assessed for the trial cohort from time of randomization.\nIn the overall cohort, patients with a high MMAI score had significantly worse OS (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.46, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.44-28.9; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and shorter TTCRPC (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.07, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.15-3.72; p\u00a0=\u00a00.015). In a multivariable Cox model, MMAI score remained the only variable significantly associated with OS (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.51, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.32-32.2; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). In the subset of patients randomized in the STOMP and ORIOLE trials, high MMAI score corresponded to improved MFS with MDT (p\u00a0=\u00a00.039) compared to patients with a low score, with p\nThe ArteraAI MMAI biomarker is prognostic for OS and TTCRPC among patients with omCSPC and may predict for response to MDT. Further work is needed to validate the MMAI biomarker in a broader mCSPC cohort.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the selection of residency program applicants is a new tool that is gaining traction, with the aim of screening high numbers of applicants while introducing objectivity and mitigating bias in a traditionally subjective process. This study aims to compare applicants screened by an AI software to a single Program Director (PD) for interview selection.\nA single PD at an ACGME-accredited, academic general surgery program screened applicants. A parallel screen by AI software, programmed by the same PD, was conducted on the same pool of applicants. Weighted preferences were assigned in the following order: personal statement, research, medical school rankings, letters of recommendation, personal qualities, board scores, graduate degree, geographic preference, past experiences, program signal, honor society membership, and multilingualism. Statistical analyses were conducted by chi-square, ANOVA, and independent two-sided t-tests.\nOut of 1235 applications, 144 applications were PD-selected and 150 AI-selected (294 top applications). Twenty applications (7.3%) were both PD and AI selected for a total analysis cohort of 274 prospective residents. We performed two analyses: 1) PD-selected vs. AI-selected vs. Both and 2) PD-selected vs. AI-selected with the overlapping applicants censored. For the first analysis, AI selected significantly: more White/Hispanic applicants (p < 0.001), less signals (p < 0.001), more AOA honors society (p\u202f=\u202f0.016), and more publications (p < 0.001). When censoring overlapping PD and AI selection, AI selected significantly: more White/Hispanic applicants (p < 0.001), less signals (p < 0.001), more US medical graduates (p\u202f=\u202f0.027), less applicants needing visa sponsorship (p\u202f=\u202f0.01), younger applicants (p\u202f=\u202f0.024), higher USMLE Step 2 CK scores (p < 0.001), and more publications (p < 0.001).\nThere was only a 7% overlap between PD-selected and AI-selected applicants for interview screening in the same applicant pool. Despite the same PD educating the AI software, the 2 application pools differed significantly. In its present state, AI may be utilized as a tool in resident application selection but should not completely replace human review. We recommend careful analysis of the performance of each AI model in the respective environment of each institution applying it, as it may alter the group of interviewees.",

    "abstract": "To provide an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning, and to evaluate whether AI improves accuracy, reliability, and time efficiency compared to expert-based manual approaches, while highlighting its current limitations.\nThis review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Checklist.\nAn electronic search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase electronic databases. Additional studies were identified from Google Scholar and by hand searching through included studies. The search was carried out until June 2023 without restriction of language and publication year.\nAfter applying the selection criteria, 71 articles were included in the review. The main research areas were classified into three domains based on the purpose of AI: diagnostics (n = 29), landmark identification (n = 20) and treatment planning (n = 22).\nThis scoping review shows that AI can be used in various orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning applications, with anatomical landmark detection being the most studied domain. While AI shows potential in improving time efficiency and reducing operator variability, the accuracy and reliability have not yet consistently surpassed those of expert clinicians. At all moments, human supervision remains essential. Further advances and optimizations are necessary to strive towards automated patient-specific treatment planning.\nAI in orthodontics has shown its ability to serve as a decision-support system, thereby enhancing the efficiency of diagnostics and treatment planning within orthodontics digital workflow.\"",

While AI shows potential in improving time efficiency and reducing operator variability, the accuracy and reliability have not yet consistently surpassed those of expert clinicians. At all moments, human supervision remains essential. Further advances and optimizations are necessary to strive towards automated patient-specific treatment planning.",

    "abstract": "To describe the clinical commissioning of an in-house artificial intelligence (AI) treatment planning platform for head-and-neck (HN) Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT).\nThe AI planning platform has three components: (1) a graphical user interface (GUI) is built within the framework of a commercial treatment planning system (TPS). The GUI allows AI models to run remotely on a designated workstation configured with GPU acceleration. (2) A template plan is automatically prepared involving both clinical and AI considerations, which include contour evaluation, isocenter placement, and beam/collimator jaw placement. (3) A well-orchestrated suite of AI models predicts optimal fluence maps, which are imported into TPS for dose calculation followed by an optional automatic fine-tuning. Six AI models provide flexible tradeoffs in parotid sparing and Planning Target Volume (PTV)-organ-at-risk (OAR) preferences. Planners could examine the plan dose distribution and make further modifications as clinically needed. The performance of the AI plans was compared to the corresponding clinical plans.\nThe average plan generation time including manual operations was 10-15\u00a0\u00a0min per case, with each AI model prediction taking \u223c1 s. The six AI plans form a wide range of tradeoff choices between left and right parotids and between PTV and OARs compared with corresponding clinical plans, which correctly reflected their tradeoff designs.\nThe in-house AI IMRT treatment planning platform was developed and is available for clinical use at our institution. The process demonstrates outstanding performance and robustness of the AI platform and provides sufficient validation.",

    "abstract": "This review aims to highlight the transformative impact of artificial intelligence in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy, particularly in the detection and characterization of colorectal polyps.\nOver the past decade, artificial intelligence has significantly advanced the medical industry, including gastrointestinal endoscopy. Computer aided diagnosis - detection (CADe) systems have shown notable success in increasing ADR. Recent meta-analyses of RCTs have demonstrated that patients undergoing colonoscopy with CADe assistance had a higher ADR compared with conventional methods. Similarly, computer aided diagnosis - characterization (CADx) systems have proven effective in distinguishing between adenomatous and nonadenomatous polyps, enhancing diagnostic confidence and supporting cost-saving measures like the resect-and-discard strategy. Despite the high performance of these systems, the variability in real-world adoption highlights the importance of integrating artificial intelligence as an assistive tool rather than a replacement for human expertise.\nArtificial intelligence integration in colonoscopy, through CADe and CADx systems, marks a significant advancement in gastroenterology. These systems enhance lesion detection and characterization, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy, training outcomes, and clinical workflow efficiency. While artificial intelligence offers substantial benefits, the optimal approach involves using artificial intelligence to augment the expertise of endoscopists, ensuring that clinical decisions remain under human oversight.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer worldwide. Histopathology, which is currently considered the gold standard for cervical cancer diagnosis, can be time-consuming and subjective. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a rapid, objective, and non-destructive cervical cancer detection technique. In this study, high-wavenumber spontaneous Raman spectroscopy was used to detect cervical squamous cell carcinoma and normal tissues. The levels of lipids, fatty acids, and proteins in cervical cancerous tissues were found to be higher than those in normal tissues. Raman difference spectroscopy revealed the most significant difference at 2928\u00a0cm",

    "abstract": "This work proposes a novel method to evaluate root canal filling (RCF) success using artificial intelligence (AI) and image analysis techniques.\n1121 teeth with root canal treatment in 597 periapical radiographs (PARs) were anonymized and manually labeled. First, RCFs were segmented using 5 different state-of-the-art deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks. Their performances were compared based on the intersection over union (IoU), dice score and accuracy. Additionally, fivefold cross validation was applied for the best-performing model and their outputs were later used for further analysis. Secondly, images were processed via a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows dental clinicians to mark the apex of the tooth, which was used to find the distance between the apex of the tooth and the nearest RCF prediction of the deep learning model towards it. The distance can show whether the RCF is normal, short or long.\nModel performances were evaluated by well-known evaluation metrics for segmentation such as IoU, Dice score and accuracy. CNN-based models can achieve an accuracy of 88%, an IoU of 79% and Dice score of 88% in segmenting root canal fillings.\nOur study demonstrates that AI-based solutions present accurate and reliable performance for root canal filling evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are complex and rapidly evolving, and thus often poorly understood, but have potentially profound implications for public health. We offer a primer for public health professionals that explains some of the key concepts involved and examines how these applications might be used in the response to a future pandemic. They include early outbreak detection, predictive modelling, healthcare management, risk communication, and health surveillance. Artificial intelligence applications, especially predictive algorithms, have the ability to anticipate outbreaks by integrating diverse datasets such as social media, meteorological data, and mobile phone movement data. Artificial intelligence-powered tools can also optimise healthcare delivery by managing the allocation of resources and reducing healthcare workers' exposure to risks. In resource distribution, they can anticipate demand and optimise logistics, while AI-driven robots can minimise physical contact in healthcare settings. Artificial intelligence also shows promise in supporting public health decision-making by simulating the social and economic impacts of different policy interventions. These simulations help policymakers evaluate complex scenarios such as lockdowns and resource allocation. Additionally, it can enhance public health messaging, with AI-generated health communications shown to be more effective than human-generated messages in some cases. However, there are risks, such as privacy concerns, biases in models, and the potential for 'false confirmations', where AI reinforces incorrect decisions. Despite these challenges, we argue that AI will become increasingly important in public health crises, but only if integrated thoughtfully into existing systems and processes.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have shown the utility and promise of artificial intelligence (AI), for the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The aim of the present study was to conduct a meta-analysis to compare the accuracy of AI tools to electrocardiographic criteria, including Sokolow-Lyon and the Cornell, most commonly used for the detection of LVH in clinical practice. Nine studies meeting the inclusion criteria were selected, comprising a sample size of 31 657 patients in the testing and 100 271 in the training datasets. Meta-analysis was performed using a hierarchal model, calculating the pooled sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, along with the 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). To ensure that the results were not skewed by one particular study, a sensitivity analysis using the 'leave-out-one approach' was adopted for all three outcomes. AI was associated with greater pooled estimates; accuracy, 80.50 (95% CI: 80.4-80.60), sensitivity, 89.29 (95% CI: 89.25-89.33) and specificity, 93.32 (95% CI: 93.26-93.38). Adjusting for weightage of individual studies on the outcomes, the results showed that while accuracy and specificity were unchanged, the adjusted pooled sensitivity was 53.16 (95% CI: 52.92-53.40). AI demonstrates higher diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity compared with conventional ECG criteria for LVH detection. AI holds promise as a reliable and efficient tool for the accurate detection of LVH in diverse populations. Further studies are needed to test AI models in hypertensive populations, particularly in low resource settings.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are anticipated to transform the practice of medicine. As one of the largest sources of digital data in healthcare, laboratory results can strongly influence AI and ML algorithms that require large sets of healthcare data for training. Embedded bias introduced into AI and ML models not only has disastrous consequences for quality of care but also may perpetuate and exacerbate health disparities. The lack of test harmonization, which is defined as the ability to produce comparable results and the same interpretation irrespective of the method or instrument platform used to produce the result, may introduce aggregation bias into algorithms with potential adverse outcomes for patients. Limited interoperability of laboratory results at the technical, syntactic, semantic, and organizational levels is a source of embedded bias that limits the accuracy and generalizability of algorithmic models. Population-specific issues, such as inadequate representation in clinical trials and inaccurate race attribution, not only affect the interpretation of laboratory results but also may perpetuate erroneous conclusions based on AI and ML models in the healthcare literature.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the application of computer systems to tasks traditionally performed by humans. The medical imaging profession has experienced a transformative shift through the integration of AI. While there have been several independent primary studies describing various aspects of AI, the current review employs a systematic approach towards describing the perspectives of radiologists and radiographers about the integration of AI in clinical practice. This review provides a holistic view from a professional standpoint towards understanding how the broad spectrum of AI tools are perceived as a unit in medical imaging practice.\nThe study utilised a systematic review approach to collect data from quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies. Inclusion criteria encompassed articles concentrating on the viewpoints of either radiographers or radiologists regarding the incorporation of AI in medical imaging practice. A stepwise approach was employed in the systematic search across various databases. The included studies underwent quality assessment using the Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs (QATSSD) checklist. A parallel-result convergent synthesis approach was employed to independently synthesise qualitative and quantitative evidence and to integrate the findings during the discussion phase.\nForty-one articles were included, all of which employed a cross-sectional study design. The main findings were themed around considerations and perspectives relating to AI education, impact on image quality and radiation dose, ethical and medico-legal implications for the use of AI, patient considerations and their perceived significance of AI for their care, and factors that influence development, implementation and job security. Despite varying emphasis, these themes collectively provide a global perspective on AI in medical imaging practice.\nWhile expertise levels are varied and different, both radiographers and radiologists were generally optimistic about incorporation of AI in medical imaging practice. However, low levels of AI education and knowledge remain a critical barrier. Furthermore, equipment errors, cost, data security and operational difficulties, ethical constraints, job displacement concerns and insufficient implementation efforts are integration challenges that should merit the attention of stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "There are few studies evaluating the accuracy of commercially available AI-powered digital auscultation platforms in detecting valvular heart disease (VHD). Therefore, the utility of these systems for diagnosing clinically significant VHD remains unclear. We conducted a comprehensive external evaluation of the Eko murmur analysis software (EMAS) and report its accuracy in detecting murmurs associated with VHD using echocardiography (ECHO) as the reference standard.\nWe analyzed phonocardiogram (PCG) and ECHO data from 1,029 individuals (461 females, mean (SD) age: 61 (29) years, BMI: 29 (9)) at a single academic medical center. PCGs were recorded using the EkoDUO and EkoCORE stethoscopes from the four standard auscultation positions immediately before transthoracic ECHO (TTE) testing. TTE diagnostics were used as reference to calculate the EMAS sensitivity and specificity in detecting murmurs associated with VHD. The 95% confidence intervals are reported.\nOf the 4,081 PCGs, 79% were of sufficient quality for murmur analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of the EMAS in detecting VHD were 39.3% (95% CI: 37.2-41.3) and 82.3% (95% CI: 80.0-84.5), respectively. EMAS sensitivity in detecting murmurs associated with common VHD types was 62.5%, 75.0%, 88.9%, and 63.3% for moderate-severe and severe cases of mitral stenosis, aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation, respectively.\nThe EMAS algorithm exhibits limited overall sensitivity in detecting VHD. The sensitivity of the algorithm varies across VHD types. These findings suggest that EMAS can be used for diagnosis of specific lesions, but not all VHD types, which limits its clinical applicability as a screening tool.",

    "abstract": "Pre-hospital emergency nurses, frequently exposed to high-stress situations, are at risk for burnout and stress-related issues, affecting their overall well-being. The Professional Quality of Life (ProQoL) scale, widely used among hospital nurses, remains untested in pre-hospital emergency settings.\nTo adapt and validate the ProQoL scale for pre-hospital emergency contexts and explore the protective role of emotional intelligence in professional well-being.\nA mixed-method study was conducted. The qualitative approach involved semi-structured interviews to inform the modification of items for adapting the ProQoL to the pre-hospital emergency setting. A quantitative method was applied to assess the relationship between emotional intelligence and professional well-being through content and face validity measures.\nQualitative interviews suggested refining the ProQoL for pre-hospital emergency settings, emphasising factors such as job satisfaction and professional conduct. The revised 21-item Pre-Hospital Emergency-Professional Quality of Life (PHE-ProQoL) scale demonstrated strong content validity (I-CVI: 0.86-1, S-CVI: 0.9) and face validity. Significant correlations were observed between emotional intelligence and professional well-being, with negative correlations between emotional intelligence and both burnout (Pearson's r\u2009=\u2009-0.859) and post-traumatic stress (Pearson's r\u2009=\u2009-0.792), and a positive correlation with compassion satisfaction (Pearson's r\u2009=\u2009+0.917). Pre-hospital nurses displayed moderate levels of compassion satisfaction (27.3\u2009\u00b1\u20099.81), high emotional intelligence (28.0\u2009\u00b1\u20099.58), especially in empathy, and substantial levels of burnout (22.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.09) and stress (21.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3).\nThe study found that pre-hospital emergency nurses exhibit moderate compassion satisfaction and above-average emotional intelligence, particularly in perceiving and managing others' emotions. However, they also experience significant levels of burnout and post-traumatic stress.\nBurnout and post-traumatic stress significantly affect pre-hospital emergency nurses. Enhancing emotional intelligence is crucial for their well-being. Nursing managers now have access to a validated and reliable tool to assess this.",

    "abstract": "Emotional Intelligence (EI) involves skills to recognise, comprehend, and manage emotions that influence thinking. Using EI allows for the integration of emotion into reasoning and problem-solving. If applied effectively, EI can foster positive emotions that promote the deployment of telepharmacy, which involves delivering pharmaceutical services remotely via telecommunication. High acceptance of telepharmacy among users, particularly patients or healthcare providers is associated with their high knowledge, positive perception, and readiness, all influenced by EI. This study investigates undergraduate students' levels of EI, knowledge, degree of perception, and readiness for telepharmacy, examines EI's correlation with all other variables, and compares them across various sociodemographic groups.\nA cross-sectional online study involving 455 undergraduate students at Universiti Teknologi MARA Cawangan Selangor (UCS) was conducted using a 74-item survey distributed via Google Forms. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 29.\nMost participants exhibited high EI (53.3\u00a0%), average knowledge (53.2\u00a0%), positive perception, and high readiness for telepharmacy. EI positively correlated with both perception (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and readiness (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Differences in knowledge were observed by field of study (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and faculty (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with higher levels among students in the pharmacy field and healthcare-related faculty. Readiness also differed by field of study (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and faculties (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with students in the pharmacy field and healthcare-related faculties exhibiting higher readiness.\nEI is crucial for the successful implementation of telepharmacy services in the future. Enhancing knowledge, perception, and readiness towards telepharmacy among undergraduate students is essential for improving its acceptance and future use.",

    "abstract": "- Accurate detection, segmentation, and volumetric analysis of brain lesions are essential in neuro-oncology. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have improved the efficiency of these processes. This study evaluated an AI-based module for detecting and segmenting brain metastases, comparing it with manual detection and segmentation.\n- MRIs from 51 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery for brain metastases were analyzed. Manual lesion identification and contouring on Leksell Gamma Plan at the time of treatment served as the gold standard. The same MRIs were processed through an AI-based module (Brainlab Smart Brush), and lesion detection and volumes were compared. Discrepancies were analyzed to identify possible sources of error.\n- Among 51 patients, 359 brain metastases were identified. The AI module achieved a sensitivity of 79.2% and a positive predictive value of 95.6%, compared to a 93.3% sensitivity for manual detection. However, for lesions\u2009>\u20090.1\u00a0cc, the AI's sensitivity rose to 97.5%, surpassing manual detection at 93%. Volumetric agreement between AI and manual segmentations was high (Spearman's \u03c1\u2009=\u20090.997, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Most lesions missed by the AI (53.8%) were near anatomical structures that complicated detection.\n- The AI module demonstrated higher sensitivity than manual detection for metastases larger than 0.1\u00a0cc, with robust volumetric accuracy. However, human expertise remains critical for detecting smaller lesions, especially near complex anatomical areas. AI offers significant potential to enhance neuro-oncology practice by improving the efficiency and accuracy of lesion management.",

    "abstract": "To characterise morphological changes in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) during anti-angiogenic therapy and explore relationships with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and development of macular atrophy (MA).\nPost-hoc analysis of the phase III HARBOR trial. SD-OCT scans from 1097 treatment-na\u00efve nAMD eyes were analysed. Volumes of intraretinal cystoid fluid (ICF), subretinal hyperreflective material (SHRM), subretinal fluid (SRF), pigment epithelial detachment (PED) and cyst-free retinal volume (CFRV) were measured by deep-learning model. Volumes were analysed by treatment regimen, macular neovascularisation (MNV) subtypes and topographic location. Associations of volumetric features with BCVA and MA development were quantified at month 12/24.\nDifferences in feature volume changes by treatment regimens and MNV subtypes were observed. Each additional 100 nanolitre unit (AHNU) of residual ICF, SHRM and CFRV at month 1 in the fovea was associated with deficits of 10.3, 7.3 and 12.2 letters at month 12. Baseline AHNUs of ICF, CFRV and PED were associated with increased odds of MA development at month 12 by 10%, 4% and 3%. While that of SRF was associated with a decrease in odds of 5%. Associations at month 24 were similar to those at month 12.\nEyes with different MNV subtypes showed distinct trajectories of feature volume response to treatment. Higher baseline volumes of ICF or PED and lower baseline volume of SRF were associated with higher likelihoods of MA development over 24 months. Residual intraretinal fluid, including ICF and CFRV, along with SHRM were predictors of poor visual outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Choledocholithiasis is a potentially life-threatening manifestation of acute biliary dysfunction (ABD) often requiring magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) for diagnosis when standard investigation findings are inconclusive. Machine learning models (MLMs) may offer alternatives to diagnose choledocholithiasis.\nThis systematic review seeks to evaluate the performance of MLMs in predicting choledocholithiasis and to compare this performance with the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines.\nThis review adhered to PRISMA guidelines. Four databases were searched for relevant records published between January 2000 and April 2024. Two researchers appraised records. MLM performance and ASGE guideline efficacy were compared, and the clinical utility of MLMs was assessed.\n408 records were screened; eight were eligible. Model accuracy ranged from 19\u00a0% to 97\u00a0%. Several records demonstrated a moderate-to-high risk of bias; of those featuring low risk of bias, peak accuracies ranged from 70\u00a0% to 85\u00a0%. Most MLMs outperformed ASGE guidelines. Important predictor variables included age, total bilirubin, and common bile duct diameter.\nMLMs outperform ASGE guidelines in predicting choledocholithiasis. Nonetheless, biases in study design and reporting limit their prospective applicability. Current MLMs do not yet rival MRCP in detecting choledocholithiasis. Future guideline development should consider MLM-driven insights for better risk prediction.",

    "abstract": "Though several nomograms exist, machine learning (ML) approaches might improve prediction of pathologic stage in patients with prostate cancer. To develop ML models to predict pathologic stage that outperform existing nomograms that use readily available clinicopathologic variables.\nPatients with prostate adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery were identified in the National Cancer Database. Seven ML models were trained to predict organ-confined (OC) disease, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and lymph node involvement (LNI). Model performance was measured using area under the curve (AUC) on a holdout testing data set. Clinical utility was evaluated using decision curve analysis (DCA). Performance metrics were confirmed on an external validation data set.\nThe ML-based extreme gradient boosted trees model achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.744, 0.749, 0.816, 0.811 for the OC, ECE, SVI, and LNI models, respectively. The MSK nomograms achieved an AUC of 0.708, 0.742, 0.806, 0.802 for the OC, ECE, SVI, and LNI models, respectively. These models also performed the best on DCA. Findings were consistent on both a holdout internal validation data set as well as an external validation data set.\nOur ML models better predicted pathologic stage relative to existing nomograms at predicting pathologic stage. Accurate prediction of pathologic stage can help oncologists and patients determine optimal definitive treatment options for patients with prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "Multiple artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been approved to risk-stratify thyroid nodules through sonographic characterization. We sought to validate the ability of one such AI system, Koios DS (Koios Medical, Chicago, IL), to aid in improving risk stratification of indeterminate thyroid nodules.\nA retrospective single-institution dataset was compiled of 28 cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules having undergone molecular testing and surgical resection, with surgical pathology categorized as malignant or benign. Nodules were retrospectively evaluated with Koios DS. After nodule selection, automated and AI-adapter-derived Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) levels were recorded, and agreement with radiologist-derived levels was assessed using Cohen's \u03ba statistic. The performance of malignancy classification was compared between the radiologist and AI-adapter. Biopsy thresholds were re-evaluated using the AI-adapter.\nIn this cohort, 7 (25%) nodules were malignant on surgical pathology. The median nodule size was 2.4\u00a0cm (interquartile range: 1.8-2.9\u00a0cm). Median radiologist and automated TI-RADS levels were both 4, with \u03ba 0.25 (\"fair agreement\"). Malignancy classification by the radiologist provided sensitivity 100%, specificity 33.3%, positive predictive value (PPV) 33.3%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 100%, compared with the AI-adapter's performance with sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 76.2%, PPV 54.5%, and NPV 94.1%. Using the AI-adapter, 14 of 28 biopsies would have been deferred, 13 of which were surgically benign.\nKoios automated and radiologist-derived TI-RADS levels were in consistent agreement for indeterminate thyroid nodules. Malignancy reclassification with the AI-adapter improved PPV at minimal cost to NPV. Risk stratification with the addition of the AI-adapter may allow for more accurate patient counseling and the avoidance of biopsies in select cases that would otherwise be cytologically indeterminate.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to use a validated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to extract muscle and adipose areas from CT images before radical cystectomy (RCx) and then correlate these measures with 90-day post-RCx complications.\nA tertiary referral center's cystectomy registry was queried for patients who underwent RCx between 2009 and 2017 for bladder cancer. Eight hundred forty-three RCx patients with CT imaging within 90 days of preceding surgery were included, to allow for extraction of body composition parameters by AI. We assessed complications within 90 days of surgery including wound, infectious, and major complications; readmission; and death. Multivariable logistic regressions associated pre-RCx measures with post-RCx complications.\nIncreasing subcutaneous adipose tissue was associated with more wound complications, while patients with increasing visceral adipose tissue had greater odds of infectious-related complications. After adjusting for patient characteristics, every 10 cm\nAutomated AI body composition measurements preoperatively are associated with post-RCx complications. These measurements, in addition to patient (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and smoking status) and surgical (robotic approach and continent diversion) characteristics, can then be used to individualize patient counseling and facilitate triage of nutritional and rehabilitation efforts.",

    "abstract": "Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) represent the most common cerebellopontine angle tumors, posing a challenge in preserving facial nerve (FN) function during surgery. We employed the Extreme Gradient Boosting machine learning classifier to predict long-term FN outcomes (classified as House-Brackmann grades 1-2 for good outcomes and 3-6 for bad outcomes) after VS surgery.\nIn a retrospective analysis of 256 patients, comprehensive pre-, intra-, and post-operative factors were examined. We applied the machine learning (ML) classifier Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for the following binary classification: long-term good and bad FN outcome after VS surgery To enhance the interpretability of our model, we utilized an explainable artificial intelligence approach.\nShort-term FN function (tau\u2009=\u20090.6) correlated with long-term FN function. The model exhibited an average accuracy of 0.83, a ROC AUC score of 0.91, and Matthew's correlation coefficient score of 0.62. The most influential feature, identified through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), was short-term FN function. Conversely, large tumor volume and absence of preoperative auditory brainstem responses were associated with unfavorable outcomes.\nWe introduce an effective ML model for classifying long-term FN outcomes following VS surgery. Short-term FN function was identified as the key predictor of long-term function. This model's excellent ability to differentiate bad and good outcomes makes it useful for evaluating patients and providing recommendations regarding FN dysfunction management.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence models are increasingly gaining popularity among patients and healthcare professionals. While it is impossible to restrict patient's access to different sources of information on the Internet, healthcare professional needs to be aware of the content-quality available across different platforms.\nTo investigate the accuracy and completeness of Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) in addressing frequently asked questions related to the management and treatment of female urinary incontinence (UI), compared to recommendations from guidelines.\nThis is a cross-sectional study. Two researchers developed 14 frequently asked questions related to UI. Then, they were inserted into the ChatGPT platform on September 16, 2023. The accuracy (scores from 1 to 5) and completeness (score from 1 to 3) of ChatGPT's answers were assessed individually by two experienced researchers in the Women's Health field, following the recommendations proposed by the guidelines for UI.\nMost of the answers were classified as \"more correct than incorrect\" (n\u2009=\u20096), followed by \"incorrect information than correct\" (n\u2009=\u20093), \"approximately equal correct and incorrect\" (n\u2009=\u20092), \"near all correct\" (n\u2009=\u20092, and \"correct\" (n\u2009=\u20091). Regarding the appropriateness, most of the answers were classified as adequate, as they provided the minimum information expected to be classified as correct.\nThese results showed an inconsistency when evaluating the accuracy of answers generated by ChatGPT compared by scientific guidelines. Almost all the answers did not bring the complete content expected or reported in previous guidelines, which highlights to healthcare professionals and scientific community a concern about using artificial intelligence in patient counseling.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the performance of machine learning and then deep learning to detect a systemic scleroderma (SSc) landscape from the same set of nailfold capillaroscopy (NC) images from the French prospective multicenter observational study SCLEROCAP.\nNC images from the first 100 SCLEROCAP patients were analyzed to assess the performance of machine learning and then deep learning in identifying the SSc landscape, the NC images having previously been independently and consensually labeled by expert clinicians. Images were divided into a training set (70\u00a0%) and a validation set (30\u00a0%). After features extraction from the NC images, we tested six classifiers (random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), light gradient boosting (LGB), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), K-nearest neighbors (KNN)) on the training set with five different combinations of the images. The performance of each classifier was evaluated by the F1 score. In the deep learning section, we tested three pre-trained models from the TIMM library (ResNet-18, DenseNet-121 and VGG-16) on raw NC images after applying image augmentation methods.\nWith machine learning, performance ranged from 0.60 to 0.73 for each variable, with Hu and Haralick moments being the most discriminating. Performance was highest with the RF, LGB and XGB models (F1 scores: 0.75-0.79). The highest score was obtained by combining all variables and using the LGB model (F1 score: 0.79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). With deep learning, performance reached a minimum accuracy of 0.87. The best results were obtained with the DenseNet-121 model (accuracy 0.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02, F1 score 0.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02, AUC 0.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03) as compared to ResNet-18 (accuracy 0.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04, F1 score 0.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03, AUC 0.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04) and VGG-16 (accuracy 0.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03, F1 score 0.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02, AUC 0.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04).\nBy using machine learning and then deep learning on the same set of labeled NC images from the SCLEROCAP study, the highest performances to detect SSc landscape were obtained with deep learning and in particular DenseNet-121. This pre-trained model could therefore be used to automatically interpret NC images in case of suspected SSc. This result nevertheless needs to be confirmed on a larger number of NC images.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in glaucoma prediction, most works lack multicenter focus and do not consider fairness concerning sex, race, or ethnicity. This study aims to examine the impact of these sensitive attributes on developing fair AI models that predict glaucoma progression to necessitating incisional glaucoma surgery.\nDatabase study.\nThirty-nine thousand ninety patients with glaucoma, as identified by International Classification of Disease codes from 7 academic eye centers participating in the Sight OUtcomes Research Collaborative.\nWe developed XGBoost models using 3 approaches: (1) excluding sensitive attributes as input features, (2) including them explicitly as input features, and (3) training separate models for each group. Model input features included demographic details, diagnosis codes, medications, and clinical information (intraocular pressure, visual acuity, etc.), from electronic health records. The models were trained on patients from 5 sites (N\u00a0=\u00a027\u00a0999) and evaluated on a held-out internal test set (N\u00a0=\u00a03499) and 2 external test sets consisting of N\u00a0=\u00a01550 and N\u00a0=\u00a02542 patients.\nArea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and equalized odds on the test set and external sites.\nSix thousand six hundred eighty-two (17.1%) of 39\u00a0090 patients underwent glaucoma surgery with a mean age of 70.1 (standard deviation 14.6) years, 54.5% female, 62.3% White, 22.1% Black, and 4.7% Latinx/Hispanic. We found that not including the sensitive attributes led to better classification performance (AUROC: 0.77-0.82) but worsened fairness when evaluated on the internal test set. However, on external test sites, the opposite was true: including sensitive attributes resulted in better classification performance (AUROC: external #1 - [0.73-0.81], external #2 - [0.67-0.70]), but varying degrees of fairness for sex and race as measured by equalized odds.\nArtificial intelligence models predicting whether patients with glaucoma progress to surgery demonstrated bias with respect to sex, race, and ethnicity. The effect of sensitive attribute inclusion and exclusion on fairness and performance varied based on internal versus external test sets. Prior to deployment, AI models should be evaluated for fairness on the target population.\nProprietary or commercial disclosure may be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.",

    "abstract": "In recent times, artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained popularity in medical as well as dental radiology. Studies have been conducted among medical and dental students and professionals about the knowledge and understanding towards AI. The aim of this study was to investigate the perceptions and acceptability of AI in dental radiology among a group of Indian patients seeking dental treatment.\nA cross-sectional research was planned with a validated questionnaire, containing ten close ended questions amongst 1562 patients. Their sociodemographic characters, opinions and attitudes regarding AI and feasibility of acceptance of AI-based dental radiological diagnosis among patients was evaluated. The study sample was divided in various groups on the basis of their age; group-1(16-30\u00a0years), group-2(31-45\u00a0years) and group-3(>45\u00a0years), educational status and urban/rural background. Statistical analysis was done by Chi-square test with significance value set at p< 0.005.\nThe participants possessed impressive knowledge about AI. Patients' awareness, attitudes and acceptability towards AI for dental radiographic diagnosis were substantially influenced by age, education level and residential background. Although many of them, especially the urban and more educated participants believed that AI could be more accurate, they preferred the human judgement. Overall, a negative attitude in terms of acceptability of AI in dental radiology was observed in this study.\nParticipants opined that AI should only be used as an auxiliary tool and valued clinical judgment over AI in ambiguous situations. It is recommended that this promising technological advancement can be used for initial screening in dental radiology.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate radiologists' interpretation errors when reading dense screening mammograms using a radiomics-based artificial intelligence approach.\nThirty-six radiologists from China and Australia read 60 dense mammograms. For each cohort, we identified normal areas that looked suspicious of cancer and the malignant areas containing cancers. Then radiomic features were extracted from these identified areas and random forest models were trained to recognize the areas that were most frequently linked to diagnostic errors within each cohort. The performance of the model and discriminatory power of significant radiomic features were assessed.\nWe found that in the Chinese cohort, the AUC values for predicting false positives were 0.864 (CC) and 0.829 (MLO), while in the Australian cohort, they were 0.652 (CC) and 0.747 (MLO). For false negatives, the AUC values in the Chinese cohort were 0.677 (CC) and 0.673 (MLO), and in the Australian cohort, they were 0.600 (CC) and 0.505 (MLO). In both cohorts, regions with higher Gabor and maximum response filter outputs were more prone to false positives, while areas with significant intensity changes and coarse textures were more likely to yield false negatives.\nThis cohort-based pipeline proves effective in identifying common errors for specific reader cohorts based on image-derived radiomic features.\nThis study demonstrates that radiomics-based AI can effectively identify and predict radiologists' interpretation errors in dense mammograms, with distinct radiomic features linked to false positives and false negatives in Chinese and Australian cohorts.",

    "abstract": "This study intended to evaluate patients' attitudes toward the use of AI in dental radiographic detection of occlusal caries and the impact of AI-based diagnosis on their trust in dentists.\nA total of 272 completed questionnaires were included in this study. In the first part of the study, approval was obtained from the patients, and data were collected about their socio-demographic characteristics. In the second part the 11-item Dentist Trust Scale was applied. In the third and fourth parts, there were questions about two clinical scenarios, the patients' knowledge of attitudes toward AI, and how the AI-based diagnosis had affected their trust. Evaluation was performed using a Likert-type scale. Data were analyzed with the Chi-square, one-way ANOVA, and ordinal logistic regression tests (p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nThe patients believed that \"AI is useful\" (3.86\u2009\u00b1\u20091.03) and were not afraid of the use of AI in dentistry (2.40\u2009\u00b1\u20091.05). Educational level was considerably related to the patients' attitudes to the use of AI for dental diagnostics (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The patients stated that \"dentists are extremely thorough and careful\" (4.39\u2009\u00b1\u20090.77).\nThe patients displayed a positive attitude to AI-based diagnosis in the dental field and appear to exhibit trust in dentists. The use of Al in routine clinical practice can\u00a0provide important benefit to physicians as a clinical decision support system in dentistry and understanding patients' attitudes may allow dentists to shape AI-supported dentistry in the future.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the cutting-edge applications of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in total-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning technology and its profound impact on the field of medical imaging. The introduction of total-body PET/CT scanners marked a major breakthrough in medical imaging, as their superior sensitivity and ultralong axial fields of view allowed for high-quality PET images of the entire body to be obtained in a single scan, greatly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of diagnoses. However, this advancement is accompanied by the challenges of increasing data volumes and data complexity levels, which pose severe challenges for traditional image processing and analysis methods. Given the excellent ability of AI technology to process massive and high-dimensional data, the combination of AI technology and ultrasensitive PET/CT can be considered a complementary match, opening a new path for rapidly improving the efficiency of the PET-based medical diagnosis process. Recently, AI technology has demonstrated extraordinary potential in several key areas related to total-body PET/CT, including radiation dose reductions, dynamic parametric imaging refinements, quantitative analysis accuracy improvements, and significant image quality enhancements. The accelerated adoption of AI in clinical practice is of particular interest and is directly driven by the rapid progress made by AI technologies in terms of interpretability; i.e., the decision-making processes of algorithms and models have become more transparent and understandable. In the future, we believe that AI technology will fundamentally reshape the use of PET/CT, not only playing a more critical role in clinical diagnoses but also facilitating the customization and implementation of personalized healthcare solutions, providing patients with safer, more accurate, and more efficient healthcare experiences.",

    "abstract": "Otoplasty is a cosmetic surgery that is performed to alter the size, shape, or position of the ear by using permanent stitches. Its main purpose is to correct protruding ears, a condition known as prominauris. After the surgery, it is crucial to provide proper care to ensure successful recovery. However, obtaining timely medical advice can be difficult, especially in remote areas or places with limited resources. To address this issue, incorporating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools like Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT)-4 into postsurgical care could help fill the gap in patient education and support.\nThis study aims to assess whether ChatGPT4 can be a reliable, accurate, and effective method for answering the most common patient questions and concerns post-otoplasty. The main objective was to assess the AI chatbot's capacity to deliver precise, concise, and pertinent information, especially in situations where health care professionals are limited in availability.\nIn this study, over 50 patients were engaged, and ChatGPT4 was employed to present the same 5 common postoperative questions post-otoplasty surgery care. The AI chatbot's responses were analyzed for accuracy, response time, clarity, and relevance.\nThe chatbot could potentially provide timely assistance, answer questions, and address concerns related to postsurgical care in otoplasty. The responses exhibited a perfect accuracy rate of 100%, closely corresponding to existing medical guidelines.\nThis study explores the potential of AI-driven solutions to enhance patient education and support, especially in areas where access to health care professionals may be limited. However, professional medical advice is crucial in postoperative care and cannot be replaced by ChatGPT-4. By leveraging AI tools like chatbots, individuals in remote or resource-limited settings can potentially receive valuable information and guidance, contributing to successful rehabilitation and overall health care outcomes. Ethical considerations around the use of AI in health care must also be carefully addressed to ensure patient privacy, data security, and appropriate clinical oversight.",

    "abstract": "We focus on the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the management of macular hole (MH). We synthesize 25 studies, comprehensively reporting on each AI model's development strategy, validation, tasks, performance, strengths, and limitations. All models analyzed ophthalmic images, and 5 (20\u202f%) also analyzed clinical features. Study objectives were categorized based on 3 stages of MH care: diagnosis, identification of MH characteristics, and postoperative predictions of hole closure and vision recovery. Twenty-two (88\u202f%) AI models underwent supervised learning, and the models were most often deployed to determine a MH diagnosis. None of the articles applied AI to guiding treatment plans. AI model performance was compared to other algorithms and to human graders. Of the 10 studies comparing AI to human graders (i.e., retinal specialists, general ophthalmologists, and ophthalmology trainees), 5 (50\u202f%) reported equivalent or higher performance. Overall, AI analysis of images and clinical characteristics in MH demonstrated high diagnostic and predictive accuracy. Convolutional neural networks comprised the majority of included AI models, including those which were high performing. Future research may consider validating algorithms to propose personalized treatment plans and explore clinical use of the aforementioned algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enhance the precision and efficiency of diagnostics and treatments in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS), leveraging advanced computational technologies to mimic intelligent human behaviors. The study aimed to examine the current state of AI in the OMS literature and highlight the urgent need for further research to optimize AI integration in clinical practice and enhance patient outcomes. A scoping review of journals related to OMS focused on OMS-related applications. PubMed was searched using terms \"artificial intelligence\", \"convolutional networks\", \"neural networks\", \"machine learning\", \"deep learning\", and \"automation\". Ninety articles were analyzed and classified into the following subcategories: pathology, orthognathic surgery, facial trauma, temporomandibular joint disorders, dentoalveolar surgery, dental implants, craniofacial deformities, reconstructive surgery, aesthetic surgery, and complications. There was a significant increase in AI-related studies published after 2019, 95.6% of the total reviewed. This surge in research reflects growing interest in AI and its potential in OMS. Among the studies, the primary uses of AI in OMS were in pathology (e.g., lesion detection, lymph node metastasis detection) and orthognathic surgery (e.g., surgical planning through facial bone segmentation). The studies predominantly employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for classification tasks, potentially improving clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly evolves in dentistry, understanding dentists' and dental students' perspectives is key. This survey evaluated Australian dentists' and students' attitudes and perceptions of AI in dentistry.\nAn online questionnaire developed on Qualtrics was distributed among registered Australian dentists and students enrolled in accredited Australian dental or oral health programmes. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were used to examine the demographic variables and participant attitudes.\n177 responses were received, and 155 complete responses were used in data analysis. 54.8% were aware of dental AI applications, but 70.3% could not name a specific AI software. A majority (91.6%) viewed AI as a supportive tool, with 69% believing that it would be beneficial in clinical tasks and 35.6% expecting it to perform similarly to an average specialist. 40% anticipated that dental AI would be routinely used in the next 5-10\u2009years, with more dental students expecting this short-term integration. Concerns included job displacement, inflexibility in patient care, and mistrust of AI's accuracy. Attitudes towards AI were influenced by age, gender, clinical experience and technological proficiency.\nThe survey underscores the potential of AI to revolutionise dental care, enhancing clinical workflows and decision-making. However, challenges like trust in AI and ethical concerns remain. It is recommended that practising dentists receive hands-on training with AI tools and continuing dental education programmes. Integrating AI into dental curricula and fostering interdisciplinary teaching and research collaborations between computer science and dentistry is necessary to prepare graduates to use AI effectively and responsibly.",

A majority (91.6%) viewed AI as a supportive tool, with 69% believing that it would be beneficial in clinical tasks and 35.6% expecting it to perform similarly to an average specialist. 40% anticipated that dental AI would be routinely used in the next 5-10\u2009years, with more dental students expecting this short-term integration. Concerns included job displacement, inflexibility in patient care, and mistrust of AI's accuracy.

    "abstract": "Current tools to review focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) images for quality have poorly defined grading criteria or are developed to grade the skills of the sonographer and not the examination. The purpose of this study is to establish a grading system with substantial agreement among coders, thereby enabling the development of an automated assessment tool for FAST examinations using artificial intelligence (AI).\nFive coders labeled a set of FAST clips. Each coder was responsible for a different subset of clips (10% of the clips were labeled in triplicate to evaluate intercoder reliability). The clips were labeled with a quality score from 1 (lowest quality) to 5 (highest quality). Clips of 3 or greater were considered passing. An AI training model was developed to score the quality of the FAST examination. The clips were split into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The predicted scores were rounded to the nearest quality level to distinguish passing from failing clips.\nA total of 1,514 qualified clips (1,399 passing and 115 failing clips) were evaluated in the final data set. This final data set had a 94% agreement between pairs of coders on the pass/fail prediction, and the set had a Krippendorff \u03b1 of 66%. The decision threshold can be tuned to achieve the desired tradeoff between precision and sensitivity. Without using the AI model, a reviewer would, on average, examine roughly 25 clips for every 1 failing clip identified. In contrast, using our model with a decision threshold of 0.015, a reviewer would examine roughly five clips for every one failing clip - a fivefold reduction in clips reviewed while still correctly identifying 85% of passing clips.\nIntegration of AI holds significant promise in improving the accurate evaluation of FAST images while simultaneously alleviating the workload burden on expert physicians.\nDiagnostic Test/Criteria; Level II.",

    "abstract": "One-fourth of colorectal neoplasia is missed at screening colonoscopy, representing the leading cause of interval colorectal cancer (I-CRC). This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the efficacy of computer-aided colonoscopy (CAC) compared to white-light colonoscopy (WLC) in reducing lesion miss rates.\nMajor databases were systematically searched through May 2024 for tandem-design RCTs comparing lesion miss rates in CAC-first followed by WLC vs WLC-first followed by CAC. The primary outcomes were adenoma miss rate (AMR) and polyp miss rate (PMR). The secondary outcomes were advanced AMR (aAMR) and sessile serrated lesion miss rate (SMR).\nSix RCTs (1718 patients) were included. AMR was significantly lower for CAC compared to WLC (RR = 0.46; 95 %CI [0.38-0.55]; P < 0.001). PMR was also lower for CAC compared to WLC (RR = 0.44; 95 %CI [0.33-0.60]; P < 0.001). No significant difference in aAMR (RR = 1.28; 95 %CI [0.34-4.83]; P = 0.71) and SMR (RR = 0.44; 95 %CI [0.15-1.28]; P = 0.13) were observed. Sensitivity analysis including only RCTs performed in CRC screening and surveillance setting confirmed lower AMR (RR = 0.48; 95 %CI [0.39-0.58]; P < 0.001) and PMR (RR = 0.50; 95 %CI [0.37-0.66]; P < 0.001), also showing significantly lower SMR (RR = 0.28; 95 %CI [0.11-0.70]; P = 0.007) for CAC compared to WLC.\nCAC results in significantly lower AMR and PMR compared to WLC overall, and significantly lower AMR, PMR and SMR in the screening/surveillance setting, potentially reducing the incidence of I-CRC.",

    "abstract": "To use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict billing code levels for emergency department (ED) encounters.\nWe accessed ED encounters from our health system from January to September 2023. We developed an ensemble model using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to predict billing codes from clinical notes combined with clinical characteristics and orders. Explainable AI techniques were used to help determine the important model features. The main endpoint was to predict evaluation and management professional billing codes (levels 2 to 5 [Current Procedural Terminology codes 99282 to 99285] and critical care). Secondary endpoints included predicting professional billing codes at different decision boundary thresholds and generalizability of the model at other EDs.\nThere were 321,893 adult ED encounters coded at levels 2 (<1%), 3 (5%), 4 (38%), 5 (51%), and critical care (5%). Model performance for professional billing code levels of 4 and 5 yielded area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.94 and 0.95, accuracy values of 0.80 and 0.92, and F1-scores of 0.79 and 0.91, respectively. At a 95% decision boundary threshold, level 5 predicted charts had a precision/positive predictive value of 0.99 and recall/sensitivity of 0.57. The most important features using Shapley Additive Explanations values were critical care note, number of orders, discharge disposition, cardiology, and psychiatry.\nCurrently available AI models accurately predict billing code levels for ED encounters based on clinical notes, clinical characteristics, and orders. This has the potential to automate coding of ED encounters and save administrative costs and time.",

    "abstract": "Developmental toxicity is key human health endpoint, especially relevant for safeguarding maternal and child well-being. It is an object of increasing attention from international regulatory bodies such as the US EPA (US Environmental Protection Agency) and ECHA (European CHemicals Agency). In this challenging scenario, non-test methods employing explainable artificial intelligence based techniques can provide a significant help to derive transparent predictive models whose results can be easily interpreted to assess the developmental toxicity of new chemicals at very early stages. To accomplish this task, we have developed web platforms such as TIRESIA and TISBE.Based on a benchmark dataset, TIRESIA employs an explainable artificial intelligence approach combined with SHAP analysis to unveil the molecular features responsible for calculating the developmental toxicity. Descending from TIRESIA, TISBE employs a larger dataset, an explainable artificial intelligence framework based on a fragment-based fingerprint encoding, a consensus classifier, and a new double top-down applicability domain. We report here some practical examples for getting started with TIRESIA and TISBE.",

    "abstract": "Emerging technologies of artificial intelligence (AI) and automated decision-making (ADM) promise to advance many industries. Healthcare is a key locus for new developments, where operational improvements are magnified by the bigger-picture promise of improved care and outcomes for patients. Forming the zeitgeist of contemporary sociotechnical innovation in healthcare, media portrayals of these technologies can shape how they are implemented, experienced and understood across healthcare systems. This article identifies current applications of AI and ADM within Australian healthcare contexts and analyses how these technologies are being portrayed within news and industry media. It offers a categorisation of leading applications of AI and ADM: monitoring and tracking, data management and analysis, cloud computing, and robotics. Discussing how AI and ADM are depicted in relation to health and care practices, it examines the sense of promise that is enlivened in these representations. The article concludes by considering the implications of promissory discourses for how technologies are understood and integrated into practices and sites of healthcare.",

The lowest performances for detection of concomitant ATTR-CM were observed in invasive measurements and ECG data with area under the curve (AUC)\u2009<\u20090.68. Individual clinical, laboratory, interventional imaging, and CT-radiomics-based features showed moderate performances (AUC 0.70-0.76, sensitivity 0.79-0.82, specificity 0.63-0.72), echocardiography demonstrated good performance (AUC 0.79, sensitivity 0.80, specificity 0.78), and 4D-CT-strain showed the highest performance (AUC 0.85, sensitivity 0.90, specificity 0.74). The multi-modality model (AUC 0.84, sensitivity 0.87, specificity 0.76) did not outperform the model performance based on 4D-CT-strain only data (p-value\u2009>\u20090.05). The multi-modality model adequately discriminated low and high-risk individuals for all-cause mortality at a mean follow-up of 13 months.\nArtificial intelligence-based models using collected pre-TAVI evaluation data can effectively detect ATTR-CM in patients with severe AS, offering an alternative diagnostic strategy to scintigraphy and myocardial biopsy.",

The lowest performances for detection of concomitant ATTR-CM were observed in invasive measurements and ECG data with area under the curve (AUC)\u2009<\u20090.68. Individual clinical, laboratory, interventional imaging, and CT-radiomics-based features showed moderate performances (AUC 0.70-0.76, sensitivity 0.79-0.82, specificity 0.63-0.72), echocardiography demonstrated good performance (AUC 0.79, sensitivity 0.80, specificity 0.78), and 4D-CT-strain showed the highest performance (AUC 0.85, sensitivity 0.90, specificity 0.74). The multi-modality model (AUC 0.84, sensitivity 0.87, specificity 0.76) did not outperform the model performance based on 4D-CT-strain only data (p-value\u2009>\u20090.05).

    "abstract": "Lipidic mesophase drug carriers have demonstrated the capacity to host and effectively deliver a wide range of active pharmaceutical ingredients, yet they have not been as extensively commercialized as other lipid-based products, such as liposomal delivery systems. Indeed, scientists are primarily focused on investigating the physics of these systems, especially in biological environments. Meanwhile, the production methods remain less advanced, and researchers are still uncertain about how the manufacturing process might affect the quality of formulations. Bringing these products to the market will require an industrial translation process. In this scenario, we have developed a robust strategy to produce lipidic mesophase-based drug delivery systems using a dual-syringe setup. We identified four critical process parameters in the newly developed method (dual-syringe method), in comparison to eight in the standard production method (gold standard), and we defined their optimal limits following a Quality by Design approach. The robustness and versatility of the proposed method were assessed experimentally by incorporating drugs with diverse physicochemical properties and augmented by machine learning which, by predicting the drug release from lipidic mesophases, reduces the formulation development time and costs.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) acts as the state-of-the-art in periodontitis diagnosis in dentistry. Current diagnostic challenges include errors due to a lack of experienced dentists, limited time for radiograph analysis, and mandatory reporting, impacting care quality, cost, and efficiency.\nThis review aims to evaluate the current and future trends in AI for diagnosing periodontitis.\nA thorough literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. We searched databases including PubMed, Scopus, Wiley Online Library, and ScienceDirect for studies published between January 2018 and December 2023. Keywords used in the search included \"artificial intelligence,\" \"panoramic radiograph,\" \"periodontitis,\" \"periodontal disease,\" and \"diagnosis.\"\nThe review included 12 studies from an initial 211 records. These studies used advanced models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), demonstrating accuracy rates for periodontal bone loss detection ranging from 0.76 to 0.98. Methodologies included deep learning hybrid methods, automated identification systems, and machine learning classifiers, enhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency.\nIntegrating AI innovations in periodontitis diagnosis enhances diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, providing a robust alternative to conventional methods. These technologies offer quicker, less labor-intensive, and more precise alternatives to classical approaches. Future research should focus on improving AI model reliability and generalizability to ensure widespread clinical adoption.",

    "abstract": "Three types of highly promising small RNA therapeutics, namely, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and the RNA subtype of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), offer advantages over small-molecule drugs. These small RNAs can target any gene product, opening up new avenues of effective and safe therapeutic approaches for a wide range of diseases. In preclinical research, synthetic small RNAs play an essential role in the investigation of physiological and pathological pathways as silencers of specific genes, facilitating discovery and validation of drug targets in different conditions. Off-target effects of small RNAs, however, could make it difficult to interpret experimental results in the preclinical phase and may contribute to adverse events of small RNA therapeutics. Out of the two major types of off-target effects we focused on the hybridization-dependent, especially on the miRNA-like off-target effects. Our main aim was to discuss several approaches, including sequence design, chemical modifications and target prediction, to reduce hybridization-dependent off-target effects that should be considered even at the early development phase of small RNA therapy. Because there is no standard way of predicting hybridization-dependent off-target effects, this review provides an overview of all major state-of-the-art computational methods and proposes new approaches, such as the possible inclusion of network theory and artificial intelligence (AI) in the prediction workflows. Case studies and a concise survey of experimental methods for validating in silico predictions are also presented. These methods could contribute to interpret experimental results, to minimize off-target effects and hopefully to avoid off-target-related adverse events of small RNA therapeutics.

    "abstract": "Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score, a reporting system of prostate MRI cases, has become a standard prostate cancer (PCa) screening method due to exceptional diagnosis performance. However, PI-RADS 3 lesions are an unmet medical need because PI-RADS provides diagnosis accuracy of only 30-40% at most, accompanied by a high false-positive rate. Here, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) based PCa screening system integrating a highly sensitive dual-gate field-effect transistor (DGFET) based multi-marker biosensor for ambiguous lesions identification. This system produces interpretable results by analyzing sensing patterns of three urinary exosomal biomarkers, providing a possibility of an evidence-based prediction from clinicians. In our results, XAI-based PCa screening system showed a high accuracy with an AUC of 0.93 using 102 blinded samples with the non-invasive method. Remarkably, the PCa diagnosis accuracy of patients with PI-RADS 3 was more than twice that of conventional PI-RADS scoring. Our system also provided a reasonable explanation of its decision that TMEM256 biomarker is the leading factor for screening those with PI-RADS 3. Our study implies that XAI can facilitate informed decisions, guided by insights into the significance of visualized multi-biomarkers and clinical factors. The XAI-based sensor system can assist healthcare professionals in providing practical and evidence-based PCa diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "This article argues that the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare, particularly under the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (AI-Act), poses significant implications for the doctor-patient relationship. While historically paternalistic, Western medicine now emphasises patient autonomy within a consumeristic paradigm, aided by technological advancements. However, hospitals worldwide are adopting AI more rapidly than before, potentially reshaping patient care dynamics. Three potential pathways emerge: enhanced patient autonomy, increased doctor control via AI, or disempowerment of both parties as decision-making shifts to private entities. This article contends that without addressing flaws in the AI-Act's risk-based approach, private entities could be empowered at the expense of patient autonomy. While proposed directives like the AI Liability Directive (AILD) and the revised Directive on Liability for Defective Products (revised PLD) aim to mitigate risks, they may not address the limitations of the AI-Act. Caution must be exercised in the future interpretation of the emerging regulatory architecture to protect patient autonomy and to preserve the central role of healthcare professionals in the care of their patients.",

    "abstract": "The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been gaining deep attention by researchers recently. In particular, the use of different types of datasets (voice, hand movements, gait, etc.) increases the variety of up-to-date models. Movement disorders and tremors are also among the most prominent symptoms of PD. The usage of drawings in the detection of PD can be a crucial decision-support approach that doctors can benefit from.\nA dataset was created by asking 40 PD and 40 Healthy Controls (HC) to draw spirals with and without templates using a special tablet. The patient-healthy distinction was achieved by classifying drawings of individuals using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Naive Bayes (NB) algorithms. Prior to classification, the data were normalized by applying the min-max normalization method. Moreover, Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) Cross-Validation (CV) approach was utilized to eliminate possible overfitting scenarios. To further improve the performances of classifiers, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) dimension reduction technique were also applied to the raw data and the results were compared accordingly.\nThe highest accuracy among machine learning based classifiers was obtained as 90% with SVM classifier using non-template drawings with PCA application.\nThe model can be used as a pre-evaluation system in the clinic as a non-invasive method that also minimizes environmental and educational level differences by using simple hand gestures such as hand drawing, writing numbers, words, and syllables. As a result of our study, preliminary preparation has been made so that hand drawing analysis can be used as an auxiliary system that can save time for health professionals. We plan to work on more comprehensive data in the future.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is reversible dementia that is underdiagnosed. The purpose of this study was to develop an automated diagnostic method for iNPH using artificial intelligence techniques with a T1-weighted MRI scan.\nWe quantified iNPH, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and healthy controls on T1-weighted 3D brain MRI scans using 452 scans for training and 110 scans for testing. Automatic component measurement algorithms were developed for the Evans index, Sylvian fissure enlargement, high-convexity tightness, callosal angle, and normalized lateral ventricle volume. XGBoost models were trained for both automated measurements and manual labels for iNPH prediction.\nA total of 452 patients (200 men; mean age, 73.2 [SD, 6.5]\u2009years) were included in the training set. Of the 452 patients, 111 (24.6%) had iNPH. We obtained area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.956 for automatically measured high-convexity tightness and 0.830 for Sylvian fissure enlargement. Intraclass correlation values of 0.824 for the callosal angle and 0.924 for the Evans index were measured. By means of the decision tree of the XGBoost model, the model trained on manual labels obtained an average cross-validation AUC of 0.988 on the training set and 0.938 on the unseen test set, while the fully automated model obtained a cross-validation AUC of 0.983 and an unseen test AUC of 0.936.\nWe demonstrated a machine learning algorithm capable of diagnosing iNPH from a 3D T1-weighted MRI that is robust to the failure. We propose a method to scan large numbers of 3D T1-weighted MRIs with minimal human intervention, making possible large-scale iNPH screening.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to improve adenoma detection during colonoscopy. This meta-analysis aimed to provide an updated evaluation of computer-aided detection (CADe) systems and their impact on key colonoscopy quality indicators.\nWe searched the EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE databases from inception until February 15, 2024, for randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing the performance of CADe systems with routine unassisted colonoscopy in the detection of colorectal adenomas.\nTwenty-eight RCTs were selected for inclusion involving 23,861 participants. Random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated a 20% increase in adenoma detection rate (risk ratio [RR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-1.27; P\u00a0< .01) and 55% decrease in adenoma miss rate (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.37-0.54; P\u00a0< .01) with AI-assisted colonoscopy.

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the accuracy, clinical concordance, and readability of the chatbot interface generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT) 3.5 as a source of breast cancer information for patients.\nTwenty questions that patients are likely to ask ChatGPT were identified by breast cancer advocates. These were posed to ChatGPT 3.5 in July 2023 and were repeated three times. Responses were graded in two domains: accuracy (4-point Likert scale, 4\u00a0=\u00a0worst) and clinical concordance (information is clinically similar to physician response; 5-point Likert scale, 5\u00a0=\u00a0not similar at all). The concordance of responses with repetition was estimated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of word counts. Response readability was calculated using the Flesch Kincaid readability scale. References were requested and verified.\nThe overall average accuracy was 1.88 (range 1.0-3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42-1.94), and clinical concordance was 2.79 (range 1.0-5.0; 95% CI, 1.94-3.64). The average word count was 310 words per response (range, 146-441 words per response) with high concordance (ICC, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59-0.91; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The average readability was poor at 37.9 (range, 18.0-60.5) with high concordance (ICC, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57-0.90; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). There was a weak correlation between ease of readability and better clinical concordance (-0.15; p\u00a0=\u00a0.025). Accuracy did not correlate with readability (0.05; p\u00a0=\u00a0.079). The average number of references was 1.97 (range, 1-4; total, 119). ChatGPT cited peer-reviewed articles only once and often referenced nonexistent websites (41%).\nBecause ChatGPT 3.5 responses were incorrect 24% of the time and did not provide real references 41% of the time, patients should be cautioned about using ChatGPT for medical information.",

    "abstract": "Lung size measurements play an important role in transplantation, as optimal donor-recipient size matching is necessary to ensure the best possible outcome. Although several strategies for size matching are currently used, all have limitations, and none has proven superior. In this pilot study, we leveraged deep learning and computer vision to develop an automated system for generating standardized lung size measurements using portable chest radiographs to improve accuracy, reduce variability, and streamline donor/recipient matching. We developed a 2-step framework involving lung mask extraction from chest radiographs followed by feature point detection to generate 6 distinct lung height and width measurements, which we validated against measurements reported by 2 radiologists (T.A. and W.B.G.) for 50 lung transplant recipients. Our system demonstrated <2.5% error (<7.0 mm) with robust interrater and intrarater agreement compared with an expert radiologist review. This is especially promising given that the radiographs used in this study were purposely chosen to include images with technical challenges such as consolidations, effusions, and patient rotation. Although validation in a larger cohort is necessary, this study highlights artificial intelligence's potential to both provide reproducible lung size assessment in real patients and enable studies on the effect of lung size matching on transplant outcomes in large data sets.",

    "abstract": "The current study aimed to systematically review the literature on the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) models for osteoporosis (OP) diagnosis using dental images. A thorough literature search was executed in October 2022 and updated in November 2023 across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The research targeted studies using AI models for OP diagnosis from dental radiographs. The main outcomes were the sensitivity and specificity of AI models regarding OP diagnosis. The \"meta\" package from the R Foundation was selected for statistical analysis. A random-effects model, along with 95% confidence intervals, was utilized to estimate pooled values. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool was employed for risk of bias and applicability assessment. Among 640 records, 22 studies were included in the qualitative analysis and 12 in the meta-analysis. The overall sensitivity for AI-assisted OP diagnosis was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.70-0.93), while the pooled specificity equaled 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-0.97). Conventional algorithms led to a pooled sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.57-0.94) and a pooled specificity of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97). Deep convolutional neural networks exhibited a pooled sensitivity of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.68-0.95) and a pooled specificity of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.83-0.96). This systematic review corroborates the accuracy of AI in OP diagnosis using dental images. Future research should expand sample sizes in test and training datasets and standardize imaging techniques to establish the reliability of AI-assisted methods in OP diagnosis through dental images.",

    "abstract": "Gynecologic cancer requires personalized care to improve outcomes. Large language models (LLMs) hold the potential to provide intelligent question-answering with reliable information about medical queries in clear and plain English, which can be understood by both healthcare providers and patients. We aimed to evaluate two freely available LLMs (ChatGPT and Google's Bard) in answering questions regarding the management of gynecologic cancer. The LLMs' performances were evaluated by developing a set questions that addressed common gynecologic oncologic findings from a patient's perspective and more complex questions to elicit recommendations from a clinician's perspective. Each question was presented to the LLM interface, and the responses generated by the artificial intelligence (AI) model were recorded. The responses were assessed based on the adherence to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and European Society of Gynecological Oncology guidelines. This evaluation aimed to determine the accuracy and appropriateness of the information provided by LLMs. We showed that the models provided largely appropriate responses to questions regarding common cervical cancer screening tests and BRCA-related questions. Less useful answers were received to complex and controversial gynecologic oncology cases, as assessed by reviewing the common guidelines. ChatGPT and Bard lacked knowledge of regional guideline variations, However, it provided practical and multifaceted advice to patients and caregivers regarding the next steps of management and follow up. We conclude that LLMs may have a role as an adjunct informational tool to improve outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Clinical decision-making in oncology is a complex process influenced by numerous disease-related factors, patient demographics, and logistical considerations. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), precision medicine is undergoing a shift toward more precise and personalized care. Wearable device technology complements this paradigm shift by offering continuous monitoring of patient vitals, facilitating early intervention, and improving treatment adherence. The integration of these technologies promises to enhance the quality of oncological care, making it more responsive and tailored to individual patient needs, thereby enabling wider implementation of such applications in the clinical setting.\nThis review article addresses the integration of wearable devices and AI in oncology, exploring their role in patient monitoring, treatment optimization, and research advancement along with an overview of completed clinical trials and utility in different aspects. The vast applications have been exemplified using several studies, and all the clinical trials completed till date have been summarized in Table 2. Additionally, we discuss challenges in implementation, regulatory considerations, and future perspectives for leveraging these technologies to enhance cancer care and radically changing the global health sector.\nAI is transforming cancer care by enhancing diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment planning tools, thus making precision medicine more effective. Wearable technology facilitates continuous, noninvasive monitoring, improving patient engagement and adherence to treatment protocols. The combined use of AI and wearables aids in monitoring patient activity, assessing frailty, predicting chemotherapy tolerance, detecting biomarkers, and managing treatment adherence. Despite these advancements, challenges such as data security, privacy, and the need for standardized devices persist. In the foreseeable future, wearable technology can hold significant potential to revolutionize personalized oncology care, empowering clinicians to deliver comprehensive and tailored treatments alongside standard therapy.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a significant global health challenge, characterized by kidney damage and decreased function. Its prevalence has steadily increased, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of its epidemiology, risk factors, and management strategies. While traditional prognostic markers such as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria provide valuable insights, they may not fully capture the complexity of CKD progression and associated cardiovascular (CV) risks.This paper reviews the current state of renal and CV risk prediction in CKD, highlighting the limitations of traditional models and the potential for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), offers a promising avenue for enhancing risk prediction by analyzing vast and diverse patient data, including genetic markers, biomarkers, and imaging. By identifying intricate patterns and relationships within datasets, AI algorithms can generate more comprehensive risk profiles, enabling personalized and nuanced risk assessments.Despite its potential, the integration of AI into clinical practice faces challenges such as the opacity of some algorithms and concerns regarding data quality, privacy, and bias. Efforts towards explainable AI (XAI) and rigorous data governance are essential to ensure transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness in AI-driven predictions.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the reliability and applicability of artificial intelligence (AI)-based analysis of leg axis parameters. We hypothesized that AI-based leg axis measurements would be less time-consuming and as accurate as those performed by human raters.\nThe study protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). PubMed, Epistemonikos, and Web of Science were searched up to 24 February\u00a02024, using a BOOLEAN search strategy. Titles and abstracts of identified records were screened through a stepwise process. Data extraction and quality assessment of the included papers were followed by a frequentist meta-analysis employing a common effect/random effects model with inverse variance and the Sidik-Jonkman heterogeneity estimator.\nA total of 13 studies encompassing 3192 patients were included in this meta-analysis. All studies compared AI-based leg axis measurements on long-leg radiographs (LLR) with those performed by human raters. The parameters hip knee ankle angle (HKA), mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA), mechanical medial proximal tibial angle (mMPTA), and joint-line convergence angle (JLCA) showed excellent agreement between AI and human raters. The AI system was approximately 3\u2009min faster in reading standing long-leg anteroposterior radiographs (LLRs) compared with human raters.\nAI-based assessment of leg axis parameters is an efficient, accurate, and time-saving procedure. The quality of AI-based assessment of the investigated parameters does not appear to be affected by the presence of implants or pathological conditions.\nLevel I.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is among the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and dementia. The artificial intelligence (AI) field is advancing quickly, and there has been little discussion on how AI could be leveraged for improving the diagnosis and management of hypertension. AI technologies, including machine learning tools, could alter the way we diagnose and manage hypertension, with potential impacts for improving individual and population health. The development of successful AI tools in public health and health care systems requires diverse types of expertise with collaborative relationships between clinicians, engineers, and data scientists. Unbiased data sources, management, and analyses remain a foundational challenge. From a diagnostic standpoint, machine learning tools may improve the measurement of blood pressure and be useful in the prediction of incident hypertension. To advance the management of hypertension, machine learning tools may be useful to find personalized treatments for patients using analytics to predict response to antihypertension medications and the risk for hypertension-related complications. However, there are real-world implementation challenges to using AI tools in hypertension. Herein, we summarize key findings from a diverse group of stakeholders who participated in a workshop held by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in March 2023. Workshop participants presented information on communication gaps between clinical medicine, data science, and engineering in health care; novel approaches to estimating BP, hypertension risk, and BP control; and real-world implementation challenges and issues.",

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) have caught the attention of many fields, including health care. The vision for AI is that a computer model can process information and provide output that is indistinguishable from that of a human and, in specific repetitive tasks, outperform a human's capability. The 2 critical underlying technologies in AI are used for supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Machine learning uses neural networks and deep learning modeled after the human brain from structured or unstructured data sets to learn, make decisions, and continuously improve the model. Natural language processing, used for supervised learning, is understanding, interpreting, and generating information using human language in chatbots and generative and conversational AI. These breakthroughs result from increased computing power and access to large data sets, setting the stage for releasing large language models, such as ChatGPT and others, and new imaging models using computer vision. Hypertension management involves using blood pressure and other biometric data from connected devices and generative AI to communicate with patients and health care professionals. AI can potentially improve hypertension diagnosis and treatment through remote patient monitoring and digital therapeutics.",

We assessed the AI algorithm's performance, which outputs Gleason patterns (3, 4, or 5), on 500 1-mm\nThe agreement between the two experienced pathologists in determining GGs at the tile level had a quadratically weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.94. The agreement between the AI algorithm and the reference standard in differentiating cancerous vs non-cancerous tissue had an unweighted Cohen's kappa of 0.91. Additionally, the AI algorithm's agreement with the reference standard in classifying tiles into GGs had a quadratically weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.89. In distinguishing cancerous vs non-cancerous tissue, the AI algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 0.997 and specificity of 0.88; in classifying GG \u22652 vs GG 1 and non-cancerous tissue, it demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.98 and specificity of 0.85.\nThe DeepDx Prostate AI algorithm had excellent agreement with expert uropathologists and performance in cancer identification and grading on RP specimens, despite being trained on biopsy specimens from an entirely different patient population.",

    "abstract": "Diagnostic cystoscopy in combination with transurethral resection of the bladder tumour are the standard for the diagnosis, surgical treatment and surveillance of bladder cancer. The ability to inspect the bladder in its current form stems from a long chain of advances in imaging science and endoscopy. Despite these advances, bladder cancer recurrence and progression rates remain high after endoscopic resection. This stagnation is a result of the heterogeneity of cancer biology as well as limitations in surgical techniques and tools, as incomplete resection and provider-specific differences affect cancer persistence and early recurrence. An unmet clinical need remains for solutions that can improve tumour delineation and resection. Translational advances in enhanced cystoscopy technologies and artificial intelligence offer promising avenues to overcoming the progress plateau.",

This study aimed to identify and relink to care HCV patients previously lost to medical follow-up in the health area of Pontevedra and O Saln\u00e9s (Spain) using an artificial intelligence-assisted system.\nActive retrospective search of previously diagnosed HCV cases recorded in the Galician Health Service proprietary health information exchange database using the Herramientas para la EXplotaci\u00f3n de la INformaci\u00f3n (HEXIN) application.\nOut of 99 lost patients identified, 64 (64.6%) were retrieved. Of these, 62 (96.88%) initiated DAA treatment and 54 patients (87.1%) achieved a sustained virological response. Mean time from HCV diagnosis was over 10 years. Main reasons for loss to follow-up were fear of possible adverse effects of treatment (30%) and mobility impediments (21%). Among the retrieved patients, almost one in three presented advanced liver fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis (F4) at evaluation. In sum, HCV patients lost to follow-up can be retrieved by screening past laboratory records. This strategy promotes the achievement of HCV elimination goals.",

    "abstract": "Nursing students are bombarded with multiple stressors. Understanding emotional intelligence (EI) and implementing EI strategies in school can help students learn more effective emotional skills. The Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Four-Branch Ability Model of EI defines EI as an ability to perceive, use, understand, and manage one's own, as well as others' emotions.\nThe goal was to increase junior baccalaureate nursing students' knowledge about EI, provide information about their EI scores, and teach students EI strategies. Two instruments were used to provide students' feedback on their EI score.\nStudents were active participants in this educational innovation on EI knowledge and were able to verbalize what they learned about EI and how they planned to implement EI strategies in their nursing practice.\nIntegration of EI competencies in nursing education programs could help future nurses cope and manage stressors associated with their job, as well as increase nurse retention and job satisfaction.

    "abstract": "To assess the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) software (BoneMetrics, Gleamer) in performing automated measurements on weight-bearing forefoot and lateral foot radiographs.\nConsecutive forefoot and lateral foot radiographs were retrospectively collected from three imaging institutions. Two senior musculoskeletal radiologists independently annotated key points to measure the hallux valgus, first-second metatarsal, and first-fifth metatarsal angles on forefoot radiographs and the talus-first metatarsal, medial arch, and calcaneus inclination angles on lateral foot radiographs. The ground truth was defined as the mean of their measurements. Statistical analysis included mean absolute error (MAE), bias assessed with Bland-Altman analysis between the ground truth and AI prediction, and intraclass coefficient (ICC) between the manual ratings.\nEighty forefoot radiographs were included (53\u2009\u00b1\u200917\u00a0years, 50 women), and 26 were excluded. Ninety-seven lateral foot radiographs were included (51\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u00a0years, 46 women), and 21 were excluded. MAE for the hallux valgus, first-second metatarsal, and first-fifth metatarsal angles on forefoot radiographs were respectively 1.2\u00b0 (95% CI [1; 1.4], bias\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.04\u00b0, ICC\u2009=\u20090.98), 0.7\u00b0 (95% CI [0.6; 0.9], bias\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.19\u00b0, ICC\u2009=\u20090.91) and 0.9\u00b0 (95% CI [0.7; 1.1], bias\u2009=\u20090.44\u00b0, ICC\u2009=\u20090.96). MAE for the talus-first, medial arch, and calcaneal inclination angles on the lateral foot radiographs were respectively 3.9\u00b0 (95% CI [3.4; 4.5], bias\u2009=\u20090.61\u00b0 ICC\u2009=\u20090.88), 1.5\u00b0 (95% CI [1.2; 1.8], bias\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.18\u00b0, ICC\u2009=\u20090.95) and 1\u00b0 (95% CI [0.8; 1.2], bias\u2009=\u20090.74\u00b0, ICC\u2009=\u20090.99). Bias and MAE between the ground truth and the AI prediction were low across all measurements. ICC between the two manual ratings was excellent, except for the talus-first metatarsal angle.\nAI demonstrated potential for accurate and automated measurements on weight-bearing forefoot and lateral foot radiographs.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Correct diagnosis requires the identification of precise morphological features such basal plasmacytosis. However, histopathological interpretation can be challenging, and it is subject to high variability.\nThe IBD-Artificial Intelligence (AI) project aims at the development of an AI-based evaluation system to support the diagnosis of IBD, semi-automatically quantifying basal plasmacytosis.\nA deep learning model was trained to detect and quantify plasma cells on a public dataset of 4981 annotated images. The model was then tested on an external validation cohort of 356 intestinal biopsies of CD, UC and healthy controls. AI diagnostic performance was calculated compared to human gold standard.\nThe system correctly found that CD and UC samples had a greater prevalence of basal plasma cells with mean number of PCs within ROIs of 38.22 (95 % CI: 31.73, 49.04) for CD, 55.16 (46.57, 65.93) for UC, and 17.25 (CI: 12.17, 27.05) for controls. Overall, OR=4.968 (CI: 1.835, 14.638) was found for IBD compared to normal mucosa (CD: +59 %; UC: +129 %). Additionally, as expected, UC samples were found to have more plasma cells in colon than CD cases.\nOur model accurately replicated human assessment of basal plasmacytosis, underscoring the value of AI models as a potential aid IBD diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "The Mayo endoscopic subscore [MES] is the most popular endoscopic disease activity measure of ulcerative colitis [UC]. Artificial intelligence [AI]-assisted colonoscopy is expected to reduce diagnostic variability among endoscopists. However, no study has been conducted to ascertain whether AI-based MES assignments can help predict clinical relapse, nor has AI been verified to improve the diagnostic performance of non-specialists.\nThis open-label, prospective cohort study enrolled 110 patients with UC in clinical remission. The AI algorithm was developed using 74 713 images from 898 patients who underwent colonoscopy at three centres. Patients were followed up after colonoscopy for 12 months, and clinical relapse was defined as a partial Mayo score\u2005>\u20052. A multi-video, multi-reader analysis involving 124 videos was conducted to determine whether the AI system reduced the diagnostic variability among six non-specialists.\nThe clinical relapse rate for patients with AI-based MES\u2005=\u20051 (24.5% [12/49]) was significantly higher [log-rank test, p\u2005=\u20050.01] than that for patients with AI-based MES\u2005=\u20050 (3.2% [1/31]). Relapse occurred during the 12-month follow-up period in 16.2% [13/80] of patients with AI-based MES\u2005=\u20050 or 1 and 50.0% [10/20] of those with AI-based MES\u2005=\u20052 or 3 [log-rank test, p\u2005=\u20050.03]. Using AI resulted in better inter- and intra-observer reproducibility than endoscopists alone.\nColonoscopy using the AI-based MES system can stratify the risk of clinical relapse in patients with UC and improve the diagnostic performance of non-specialists.",

    "abstract": "Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) hold significant promise as drug delivery systems (DDS) owing to their small size and efficient drug-loading capabilities. Surface functionalization of NLCs can facilitate interaction with specific cell receptors, enabling targeted cell delivery. Mannosylation has emerged as a valuable tool for increasing the ability of nanoparticles to be recognized and internalized by macrophages. Nevertheless, the design and development of functionalized NLC is a complex task that entails the optimization of numerous variables and steps, making the process challenging and time-consuming. Moreover, no previous studies have been focused on evaluating the functionalization efficiency. In this work, hybrid Artificial Intelligence technologies are used to help in the design of mannosylated drug loaded NLCs. Artificial neural networks combined with fuzzy logic or genetic algorithms were employed to understand the particle formation processes and optimize the combinations of variables for the different steps in the functionalization process. Mannose was chemically modified to allow, for the first time, functionalization efficiency quantification and optimization. The proposed sequential methodology has enabled the design of a robust procedure for obtaining stable mannosylated NLCs with a uniform particle size distribution, small particle size (<\u2009100\u00a0nm), and a substantial positive zeta potential (>\u200920mV). The incorporation of mannose on the surfaces of these DDS following the established protocols achieved\u2009>\u200985% of functionalization efficiency. This high effectiveness should enhance NLC recognition and internalization by macrophages, thereby facilitating the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence is a technology that provides greater connectivity with people through conversational bots (\u00abchatbots\u00bb).\u00a0These bots can engage in dialogue using natural language indistinguishable from humans and are a potential source of information for patients.The aim of this study is to examine the performance of these bots in solving specific issues related to orthopedic surgery and traumatology using questions from the Spanish MIR exam between 2008 and 2023.\nThree \u00abchatbot\u00bb models (ChatGPT, Bard and Perplexity) were analyzed by answering 114 questions from the MIR. Their accuracy was compared, the readability of their responses was evaluated, and their dependence on logical reasoning and internal and external information was examined. The type of error was also evaluated in the failures.\nChatGPT obtained 72.81% correct answers, followed by Perplexity (67.54%) and Bard (60.53%).Bard provides the most readable and comprehensive responses. The responses demonstrated logical reasoning and the use of internal information from the question prompts. In 16 questions (14%), all 3 applications failed simultaneously. Errors were identified, including logical and information failures.\nWhile conversational bots can be useful in resolving medical questions, caution is advised due to the possibility of errors. Currently, they should be considered as a developing tool, and human opinion should prevail over Generative Artificial Intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized medicine over the past several years. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a deep learning framework that has become a powerful technique in medicine, particularly in ophthalmology for image analysis. In this paper we review the current ophthalmic literature involving GANs, and highlight key contributions in the field. We briefly touch on ChatGPT, another application of generative AI, and its potential in ophthalmology. We also explore the potential uses for GANs in ocular imaging, with a specific emphasis on 3 primary domains: image enhancement, disease identification, and generating of synthetic data. PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Google Scholar were searched from inception to October 30, 2022, to identify applications of GAN in ophthalmology. A total of 40 papers were included in this review. We cover various applications of GANs in ophthalmic-related imaging including optical coherence tomography, orbital magnetic resonance imaging, fundus photography, and ultrasound; however, we also highlight several challenges that resulted in the generation of inaccurate and atypical results during certain iterations. Finally, we examine future directions and considerations for generative AI in ophthalmology.",

    "abstract": "Clinical decision-making in gastrointestinal surgery is complex due to the unpredictability of tumoral behavior and postoperative complications. Artificial intelligence (AI) could aid in clinical decision-making by predicting these surgical outcomes. The current status of AI-based clinical decision-making within gastrointestinal surgery is unknown in recent literature. This review aims to provide an overview of AI models used for clinical decision-making within gastrointestinal surgery.\nA systematic literature search was performed in databases PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science. To be eligible for inclusion, studies needed to use AI models for clinical decision-making involving patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. Studies reporting on reviews, children, and study abstracts were excluded. The Probast risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of AI methods.\nOut of 1073 studies, 10 articles were eligible for inclusion. AI models have been used to make clinical decisions between surgical procedures, selection of chemotherapy, selection of postoperative follow up programs, and implementation of a temporary ileostomy. Most studies have used a Random Forest or Gradient Boosting model with AUCs up to 0.97. All studies involved a retrospective study design, in which external validation was performed in one study.\nThis review shows that AI models have the potentiality to select the most optimal treatments for patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. Clinical benefits could be gained if AI models were used for clinical decision-making. However, prospective studies and randomized controlled trials will reveal the definitive role of AI models in clinical decision-making.",

These manual segmentations were used to train a machine learning algorithm to automatically detect facial landmarks and calculate these measurements. The main outcomes were the mean absolute error and intraclass correlation coefficient.\nA total of 958 eyes from 479 participants were included. The testing set consisted of 290 eyes from 145 patients. The AI algorithm demonstrated close agreement with human measurements, with mean absolute errors ranging from 0.22 mm for IPD to 0.88 mm for IICD. The intraclass correlation coefficients indicated excellent reliability (ICC\u2009>\u20090.90) for MRD1, MRD2, PFH, OICD, IICD, and IPD, while HPA showed good reliability (ICC 0.84). The landmark detection model was highly accurate and achieved a mean error rate of 0.51% and failure rate at 0.1 of 0%.\nThe automated facial landmark detection network provided accurate and reliable periocular measurements.

    "abstract": "Quantification of total cardiovascular risk is essential for individualizing hypertension treatment. This study aimed to develop and validate a novel, machine-learning-derived model to predict cardiovascular mortality risk using office blood pressure (OBP) and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP).\nThe performance of the novel risk score was compared with existing risk scores, and the possibility of predicting ABP phenotypes utilizing clinical variables was assessed. Using data from 59\u2005124 patients enrolled in the Spanish ABP Monitoring registry, machine-learning approaches (logistic regression, gradient-boosted decision trees, and deep neural networks) and stepwise forward feature selection were used.\nFor the prediction of cardiovascular mortality, deep neural networks yielded the highest clinical performance. The novel mortality prediction models using OBP and ABP outperformed other risk scores. The area under the curve achieved by the novel approach, already when using OBP variables, was significantly higher when compared with the area under the curve of the Framingham risk score, Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease score.

    "abstract": "Swarm behaviors are common in nature, where individual organisms collaborate via perception, communication, and adaptation. Emulating these dynamics, large groups of active agents can self-organize through localized interactions, giving rise to complex swarm behaviors, which exhibit potential for applications across various domains. This review presents a comprehensive summary and perspective of synthetic swarms, to bridge the gap between the microscale individual agents and potential applications of synthetic swarms. It is begun by examining active agents, the fundamental units of synthetic swarms, to understand the origins of their motility and functionality in the presence of external stimuli. Then inter-agent communications and agent-environment communications that contribute to the swarm generation are summarized. Furthermore, the swarm behaviors reported to date and the emergence of machine intelligence within these behaviors are reviewed. Eventually, the applications enabled by distinct synthetic swarms are summarized. By discussing the emergent machine intelligence in swarm behaviors, insights are offered into the design and deployment of autonomous synthetic swarms for real-world applications.",

Involvement within the workforce will foster support for algorithm development and implementation.\nTo develop a supportive ecosystem that enables pathologists with variable expertise in artificial intelligence to create algorithms in a development environment with seamless transition to a production environment.\nThe development team considered internal development and vended solutions. Because of the extended timeline and resource requirements for internal development, a decision was made to use a vended solution. Vendor proposals were solicited and reviewed by pathologists, IT, and security groups. A vendor was selected and pipelines for development and production were established. Proposals for development were solicited from the pathology department. Eighty-four investigators were selected for the initial cohort, receiving training and access to dedicated subject matter experts. A total of 30 of 31 projects progressed through the model development process of annotating, training, and validation. Based on these projects, 15 abstracts were submitted to national meetings.\nDemocratizing artificial intelligence by creating an ecosystem to support pathologists with varying levels of expertise can break down entry barriers, reduce overall cost of algorithm development, improve algorithm quality, and enhance the speed of adoption.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is already impacting the practice of medicine and it is therefore important for future healthcare professionals and medical educators to gain experience with the benefits, limitations, and applications of this technology. The purpose of this project was to develop, implement, and evaluate a faculty development workshop on generative AI using ChatGPT, to familiarise participants with AI.\nA brief workshop introducing faculty to generative AI and its applications in medical education was developed for preclinical clinical skills preceptors at our institution. During the workshop, faculty were given prompts to enter into ChatGPT that were relevant to their teaching activities, including generating differential diagnoses and providing feedback on student notes. Participant feedback was collected using an anonymous survey.\n27/36 participants completed the survey. Prior to the workshop, 15% of participants indicated having used ChatGPT, and approximately half were familiar with AI applications in medical education. Interest in using the tool increased from 43% to 65% following the workshop, yet participants expressed concerns regarding accuracy and privacy with use of ChatGPT.\nThis brief workshop serves as a model for faculty development in AI applications in medical education. The workshop increased interest in using ChatGPT for educational purposes, and was well received.",

    "abstract": "The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) AI Task Force along with experts in endoscopy, technology space, regulatory authorities, and other medical subspecialties initiated a consensus process that analyzed the current literature, highlighted potential areas, and outlined the necessary research in artificial intelligence (AI) to allow a clearer understanding of AI as it pertains to endoscopy currently.\nA modified Delphi process was used to develop these consensus statements.\nStatement 1: Current advances in AI allow for the development of AI-based algorithms that can be applied to endoscopy to augment endoscopist performance in detection and characterization of endoscopic lesions. Statement 2: Computer vision-based algorithms provide opportunities to redefine quality metrics in endoscopy using AI, which can be standardized and can reduce subjectivity in reporting quality metrics. Natural language processing-based algorithms can help with the data abstraction needed for reporting current quality metrics in GI endoscopy effortlessly. Statement 3: AI technologies can support smart endoscopy suites, which may help optimize workflows in the endoscopy suite, including automated documentation. Statement 4: Using AI and machine learning helps in predictive modeling, diagnosis, and prognostication. High-quality data with multidimensionality are needed for risk prediction, prognostication of specific clinical conditions, and their outcomes when using machine learning methods. Statement 5: Big data and cloud-based tools can help advance clinical research in gastroenterology. Multimodal data are key to understanding the maximal extent of the disease state and unlocking treatment options. Statement 6: Understanding how to evaluate AI algorithms in the gastroenterology literature and clinical trials is important for gastroenterologists, trainees, and researchers, and hence education efforts by GI societies are needed. Statement 7: Several challenges regarding integrating AI solutions into the clinical practice of endoscopy exist, including understanding the role of human-AI interaction. Transparency, interpretability, and explainability of AI algorithms play a key role in their clinical adoption in GI endoscopy. Developing appropriate AI governance, data procurement, and tools needed for the AI lifecycle are critical for the successful implementation of AI into clinical practice. Statement 8: For payment of AI in endoscopy, a thorough evaluation of the potential value proposition for AI systems may help guide purchasing decisions in endoscopy. Reliable cost-effectiveness studies to guide reimbursement are needed. Statement 9: Relevant clinical outcomes and performance metrics for AI in gastroenterology are currently not well defined. To improve the quality and interpretability of research in the field, steps need to be taken to define these evidence standards. Statement 10: A balanced view of AI technologies and active collaboration between the medical technology industry, computer scientists, gastroenterologists, and researchers are critical for the meaningful advancement of AI in gastroenterology.\nThe consensus process led by the ASGE AI Task Force and experts from various disciplines has shed light on the potential of AI in endoscopy and gastroenterology. AI-based algorithms have shown promise in augmenting endoscopist performance, redefining quality metrics, optimizing workflows, and aiding in predictive modeling and diagnosis. However, challenges remain in evaluating AI algorithms, ensuring transparency and interpretability, addressing governance and data procurement, determining payment models, defining relevant clinical outcomes, and fostering collaboration between stakeholders. Addressing these challenges while maintaining a balanced perspective is crucial for the meaningful advancement of AI in gastroenterology.",

    "abstract": "Responsive materials possess the inherent capacity to autonomously sense and respond to various external stimuli, demonstrating physical intelligence. Among the diverse array of responsive materials, liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) stand out for their remarkable reversible stimuli-responsive shape-morphing properties and their potential for creating soft robots. While numerous reviews have extensively detailed the progress in developing LCP-based actuators and robots, there exists a need for comprehensive summaries that elucidate the underlying principles governing actuation and how physical intelligence is embedded within these systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in developing actuators and robots endowed with physical intelligence using LCPs. This review is structured around the stimulus conditions and categorizes the studies involving responsive LCPs based on the fundamental control and stimulation logic and approach. Specifically, three main categories are examined: systems that respond to changing stimuli, those operating under constant stimuli, and those equip with learning and logic control capabilities. Furthermore, the persisting challenges that need to be addressed are outlined and discuss the future avenues of research in this dynamic field.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic antibodies (Abs) represent a category of engineered proteins meticulously crafted to replicate the functions of their natural counterparts. Such Abs are generated in vitro, enabling advanced molecular alterations associated with antigen recognition, paratope site engineering, and biochemical refinements. In a parallel realm, deep sequencing has brought about a paradigm shift in molecular biology. It facilitates the prompt and cost-effective high-throughput sequencing of DNA and RNA molecules, enabling the comprehensive big data analysis of Ab transcriptomes, including specific regions of interest. Significantly, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), based on machine- and deep- learning approaches, has fundamentally transformed our capacity to discern patterns hidden within deep sequencing big data,\u00a0including distinctive Ab features and protein folding free energy landscapes. Ultimately, current AI advances can generate approximations of the most stable Ab structural configurations, enabling the prediction of de novo synthetic Abs. As a result, this manuscript comprehensively examines the latest and relevant literature concerning the intersection of deep sequencing big data and AI methodologies for the design and development of synthetic Abs. Together, these advancements have accelerated the exploration of antibody repertoires, contributing to the refinement of synthetic Ab engineering and optimizations, and facilitating advancements in the lead identification process.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic health condition (long-lasting) due to inadequate control of blood levels of glucose. This study presents a prediction of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus among women using various Machine Learning Algorithms deployed to predict the diabetic condition. A University of California Irvine Diabetes Mellitus Dataset posted in Kaggle was used for analysis.\nThe dataset included eight risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus prediction, including Age, Systolic Blood Pressure, Glucose, Body Mass Index, Insulin, Skin Thickness, Diabetic Pedigree Function, and Pregnancy. R language was used for the data visualization, while the algorithms considered for the study are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and Extreme Gradient Boost. The performance analysis of these algorithms on various classification metrics is also presented here, considering the Area Under the Curve and Receiver Operating Characteristics score is the best for Extreme Gradient Boost with 85%, followed by Support Vector Machines and Decision Trees.\nThe Logistic Regression is showing low performance. But the Decision Trees and Extreme Gradient Boost show promising performance against all the classification metrics. But the Support Vector Machines offers a lower support value; hence it cannot be claimed to be a good classifier. The model showed that the most significant predictors of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus were strongly correlated with Glucose Levels and mediumly correlated with Body Mass Index, whereas Age, Skin Thickness, Systolic Blood Pressure, Insulin, Pregnancy, and Pedigree Function were less significant. This type of real-time analysis has proved that the symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in women fall entirely different compared to men, which highlights the importance of Glucose Levels and Body Mass Index in women.\nThe prediction of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus helps public health professionals to help people by suggesting proper food intake and adjusting lifestyle activities with good fitness management in women to make glucose levels and body mass index controlled. Therefore, the healthcare systems should give special attention to diabetic conditions in women to reduce exacerbations of the disease and other associated symptoms. This work attempts to predict the occurrence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus among women on their behavioral and biological conditions.",

    "abstract": "This paper attempted to examine suicidal ideation among adolescents in terms of bullying victimization and emotional intelligence. It had been observed that adolescents have to face the challenge of suicidal ideation through bullying and reduce it through emotional intelligence. A sample of 1017 adolescents was sampled from public sector primary schools in the district of Gujrat, Punjab, Pakistan to conduct the cross-sectional survey. For this study, the scale of bullying victimization (Illinois Bullying Scale by Espelage & Holt, 2001), emotional intelligence (Emotional Intelligence Scale for Children & Adolescents by Batool & Hayat, 2018) and suicidal ideation (Suicidal Ideation Attribution Scale by Van Spijker, 2014) had been used to measure the responses of the students. The study findings pointed out that emotional intelligence was a significant negative predictor of suicidal ideation. Similarly, the analysis showed that bullying victimization was a significant predictor of suicidal ideation among adolescents.",
