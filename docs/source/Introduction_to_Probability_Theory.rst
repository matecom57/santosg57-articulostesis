1. Probability Spaces

1.1 Examples of random phenomena

1.2 Probability spaces

* to develop the formal mathematical structure, called a probabilty space
* random phenomena

envision -

* on the possible outcomes of the experiment
* we choose a set :math:`\Omega` whose points :math:`w` are associated with these outcomes.
* we next take a nonempty collection :math:`\mathscr{A}` AA of subsets of :math:`\Omega`  OMEGA that is to represent the collection of "**events**" to which we wish to assign probabilities.
* By definition, now, an event means a set A in AA.
* The statement the event A occurs means that the outcome of our experiment is represented by some point :math:`w \in A`
