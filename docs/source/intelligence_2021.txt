    "abstract": "The fast-paced diffusion of technologies broadly falling under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI) is said to be shaping the emerging world order in international relations (IR). It is expected that the global AI race will pave the way for another rise and fall of great powers in the international system, similar to the impact caused by the three industrial revolutions of the past. The literature in IR identifies three major powers - namely, the United States of America (USA), China, and Russia, as the leading contenders in this AI race. The ongoing AI-enabled fourth industrial revolution is all the more unique due to the markedly different approaches these three powers have adopted for integrating AI into their military, political, and socio-economic spheres. The AI strategies of these countries further reflect their capabilities and intentions towards how they plan on employing the technology to elevate their prestige and power status in the international system. This paper draws from a historiography of the First, Second, and Third Industrial Revolutions to study how technological innovations have altered relative power capabilities of nations, triggering a re-ordering of power hierarchies at a systemic level. Drawing from this understanding, it analyses the nature of AI as an emerging technology and assesses whether it can cause systemic alterations. It critically examines and compares the AI strategies of the USA, China, and Russia as leading contenders in the global AI race and outlines their strengths and weaknesses. It further draws from the Adoption Capacity Theory to argue that the AI race may well be determined by the relative capacity of the major institutions in each of these countries to manage and adapt to the disruptions this technology is bound to bring to the fore.",

    "abstract": "Information management capacity is crucial for controlling risks from health emergencies. But little is known about how sub-national public health bodies overcome public health intelligence challenges when responding to disease outbreaks. This paper describes a protocol for a mixed-methods systematic review to fill this knowledge gap. In addition to describing the evidence base and characterising public health intelligence responses, it will explore reported facilitators and barriers to response.\nResearch on sub-national Public Health Intelligence disease outbreak responses will be synthesised. The review will be limited to articles published in English, during or after 2019. Key electronic databases will be searched for peer-reviewed, primary research studies. Two reviewers will independently screen articles for relevance. Articles that refer to a public health intelligence response to a propagated disease outbreak by a sub-national Public Health Authority will be included. Quality assessment of included articles will be undertaken using published tools. Data integration will be by the Pillar Integration Process (PIP).\nThis review will describe and synthesise the recent literature on sub-national Public Health Authorities' responses to propagated disease outbreaks. The systematic design will limit bias and the inclusion of data from quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies will ensure relevant evidence is considered regardless of the methodology used to produce it. The review is part of a larger research project which aims to explore the role of sub-national public health intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigate how public health intelligence preparedness could be improved in the future. This could provide information to support the development of training, preparedness indicators and/or ways of implementing directives.\nCRD42022308042 (08/02/2022).\nWhat are the information challenges for local public health services responding to an outbreak of disease? Useful information is vital for planning public health activities. This means good information management is very important during an outbreak of disease. But little is known about how local public health bodies overcome challenges in this area. Examples of challenges could include not receiving sufficient data and/or not having enough staff to analyse it. This paper describes planned research based on a review of the literature. We want to know how local public health bodies have collected, analysed and provided useful information during disease outbreaks and what makes it easier or harder for them to do this. To make the results more reliable, the review will take a structured approach. Two people will work on some stages to check each other\u2019s work. We will search databases of research articles to find any kind of study that describes information challenges for local public health organisations during a disease outbreak. Specific criteria will be used to judge which studies to include. To be included, studies must be about a disease that spreads from person-to-person, and they must have been published in or after 2019. Included studies will be summarised. Results will feed into further research on how local public health bodies could be better prepared for disease outbreaks in the future.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents our recent research on integrating artificial emotional intelligence in a social robot (Ryan) and studies the robot's effectiveness in engaging older adults. Ryan is a socially assistive robot designed to provide companionship for older adults with depression and dementia through conversation. We used two versions of Ryan for our study, empathic and non-empathic. The empathic Ryan utilizes a multimodal emotion recognition algorithm and a multimodal emotion expression system. Using different input modalities for emotion, i.e. facial expression and speech sentiment, the empathic Ryan detects users emotional state and utilizes an affective dialogue manager to generate a response. On the other hand, the non-empathic Ryan lacks facial expression and uses scripted dialogues that do not factor in the users emotional state. We studied these two versions of Ryan with 10 older adults living in a senior care facility. The statistically significant improvement in the users' reported face-scale mood measurement indicates an overall positive effect from the interaction with both the empathic and non-empathic versions of Ryan. However, the number of spoken words measurement and the exit survey analysis suggest that the users perceive the empathic Ryan as more engaging and likable.",

    "abstract": "Emotions play a significant role in human relations, decision-making, and the motivation to act on those decisions. There are ongoing attempts to use artificial intelligence (AI) to read human emotions, and to predict human behavior or actions that may follow those emotions. However, a person's emotions cannot be easily identified, measured, and evaluated by others, including automated machines and algorithms run by AI. The ethics of emotional AI is under research and this study has examined the emotional variables as well as the perception of emotional AI in two large random groups of college students in an international university in Japan, with a heavy representation of Japanese, Indonesian, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and other Asian nationalities. Surveys with multiple close-ended questions and an open-ended essay question regarding emotional AI were administered for quantitative and qualitative analysis, respectively. The results demonstrate how ethically questionable results may be obtained through affective computing and by searching for correlations in a variety of factors in collected data to classify individuals into certain categories and thus aggravate bias and discrimination. Nevertheless, the qualitative study of students' essays shows a rather optimistic view over the use of emotional AI, which helps underscore the need to increase awareness about the ethical pitfalls of AI technologies in the complex field of human emotions.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expanding with colossal applications in various sectors. In the healthcare sector, it is booming to make life simpler with utmost accuracy by predicting, diagnosing and up to care with the help of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) applications. Modern computer algorithms have attained accuracy levels comparable to those of human specialists in medical sciences, although computers often do jobs more quickly than people do. It is also expected that there will not be a mandate for humans to be present for the jobs that machines can do, and it is gaining the highest peak because of good trained artificial models in the medical field. ML enhances the therapeutic process and improves health by encouraging more patient participation. ML may get more accurate patient data when used with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and automate message notifications that prompt patients to respond at certain times. The motivation behind this article is to make a comprehensive review of the on-going implementation of ML in medical science, what challenges it is facing now, and how it can be simplified for future researchers to contribute better to medical sciences while applying it to the practitioners' jobs easier. In this review, we have extensively mined the data and brought up systematised applications of AI in healthcare, what challenges have been faced by the experts, and what ethical responsibilities are liable to them while taking the data. We also tabulated which algorithms will be helpful for what kind of data and disease conditions will be useful for future researchers and developers. This article will provide a better insight into AI and ML for the beginner to the advanced developer and researcher to understand the concepts from the basics.",

    "abstract": "Automatic skin lesion recognition has shown to be effective in increasing access to reliable dermatology evaluation; however, most existing algorithms rely solely on images. Many diagnostic rules, including the 3-point checklist, are not considered by artificial intelligence algorithms, which comprise human knowledge and reflect the diagnosis process of human experts.\nIn this paper, we aimed to develop a semisupervised model that can not only integrate the dermoscopic features and scoring rule from the 3-point checklist but also automate the feature-annotation process.\nWe first trained the semisupervised model on a small, annotated data set with disease and dermoscopic feature labels and tried to improve the classification accuracy by integrating the 3-point checklist using ranking loss function. We then used a large, unlabeled data set with only disease label to learn from the trained algorithm to automatically classify skin lesions and features.\nAfter adding the 3-point checklist to our model, its performance for melanoma classification improved from a mean of 0.8867 (SD 0.0191) to 0.8943 (SD 0.0115) under 5-fold cross-validation. The trained semisupervised model can automatically detect 3 dermoscopic features from the 3-point checklist, with best performances of 0.80 (area under the curve [AUC] 0.8380), 0.89 (AUC 0.9036), and 0.76 (AUC 0.8444), in some cases outperforming human annotators.\nOur proposed semisupervised learning framework can help with the automatic diagnosis of skin disease based on its ability to detect dermoscopic features and automate the label-annotation process. The framework can also help combine semantic knowledge with a computer algorithm to arrive at a more accurate and more interpretable diagnostic result, which can be applied to broader use cases.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played a substantial role in the response to the challenges posed by the current pandemic. The growing interest in using AI to handle Covid-19 issues has accelerated the pace of AI research and resulted in an exponential increase in articles and review studies within a very short period of time. Hence, it is becoming challenging to explore the large corpus of academic publications dedicated to the global health crisis. Even with the presence of systematic review studies, given their number and diversity, identifying trends and research avenues beyond the pandemic should be an arduous task. We conclude therefore that after the one-year mark of the declaration of Covid-19 as a pandemic, the accumulated scientific contribution lacks two fundamental aspects: Knowledge synthesis and Future projections. In contribution to fill this void, this paper is a (i) synthesis study and (ii) foresight exercise. The synthesis study aims to provide the scholars a consolidation of findings and a knowledge synthesis through a systematic review of the reviews (umbrella review) studying AI applications against Covid-19. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and other preprint sources from 1st December 2019 to 1st June 2021 for eligible reviews. The literature search and screening process resulted in 45 included reviews. Our findings reveal patterns, relationships, and trends in the AI research community response to the pandemic. We found that in the space of few months, the research objectives of the literature have developed rapidly from identifying potential AI applications to evaluating current uses of intelligent systems. Only few reviews have adopted the ",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is frequently used in non-medical fields to assist with automation and decision-making. The potential for AI in pediatric cardiology, especially in the echocardiography laboratory, is very high. There are multiple tasks AI is designed to do that could improve the quality, interpretation, and clinical application of echocardiographic data at the level of the sonographer, echocardiographer, and clinician. In this state-of-the-art review, we highlight the pertinent literature on machine learning in echocardiography and discuss its applications in the pediatric echocardiography lab with a focus on automation of the pediatric echocardiogram and the use of echo data to better understand physiology and outcomes in pediatric cardiology. We also discuss next steps in utilizing AI in pediatric echocardiography.",

    "abstract": "In vitro diagnostics (IVD) plays a critical role in healthcare and public health management. Magnetic digital microfluidics (MDM) perform IVD assays by manipulating droplets on an open substrate with magnetic particles. Automated IVD based on MDM could reduce the risk of accidental exposure to contagious pathogens among healthcare workers. However, it remains challenging to create a fully automated IVD platform based on the MDM technology because of a lack of effective feedback control system to ensure the successful execution of various droplet operations required for IVD. In this work, an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered MDM platform with image-based real-time feedback control is presented. The AI is trained to recognize droplets and magnetic particles, measure their size, and determine their location and relationship in real time; it shows the ability to rectify failed droplet operations based on the feedback information, a function that is unattainable by conventional MDM platforms, thereby ensuring that the entire IVD process is not interrupted due to the failure of liquid handling. We demonstrate fundamental droplet operations, which include droplet transport, particle extraction, droplet merging and droplet mixing, on the MDM platform and show how the AI rectify failed droplet operations by acting upon the feedback information. Protein quantification and antibiotic resistance detection are performed on this AI-empowered MDM platform, and the results obtained agree well with the benchmarks. We envision that this AI-based feedback approach will be widely adopted not only by MDM but also by other types of digital microfluidic platforms to offer precise and error-free droplet operations for a wide range of automated IVD applications.",

    "abstract": "The intelligence quotient (IQ) is a dependable measurement for intellectual functioning that reflects computable cognitive abilities. According to earlier cross-sectional studies designs, developing higher BMI related to decreased IQ in adolescents population. Therefore, it is of interest to determine the correlation between IQ and BMI. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale-IV was used to assess intelligence. Body Mass Index (weight in kg/height in metre squares) was calculated using height and weight. A questionnaire was developed after the elaborated discussion and circulated among the students. The data was then analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2019. The correlation among intelligent quotient and BMI was found to be positive: r = 0.447, N = 300, p<0.05. Data shows that the IQ score is moderately associated with BMI. However, the other factors such as, parental IQ, nutrition, and socioeconomic status is taken into account, this effect appears to differ.",

    "abstract": "Clinicians and administrators are applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) Techniques widely as the promising results of their applications in the healthcare have been established. The meaningful impact of the AI applications will be limited unless it is coherently applied with human diagnosis and inputs from specialist clinician. This will help to address limitations and take advantage of the promises of the AI techniques. Machine Learning is one of the AI technique that finds high relevance in the medicine and health care. This review provides an overall glimpse of current practices and research outcomes of the application of the AI techniques in the healthcare and medical practices. It further describes Machine Learning Techniques in disease prediction and scope for food formulations for combatting disease.",

    "abstract": "Historically, threat information sharing has relied on manual modelling and centralised network systems, which can be inefficient, insecure, and prone to errors. Alternatively, private blockchains are now widely used to address these issues and improve overall organisational security. An organisation's vulnerabilities to attacks might change over time. It is utterly important to find a balance among a current threat, the potential countermeasures, their consequences and costs, and the estimation of the overall risk that this provides to the organisation. For enhancing organisational security and automation, applying threat intelligence technology is critical for detecting, classifying, analysing, and sharing new cyberattack tactics. Trusted partner organisations can then share newly identified threats to improve their defensive capabilities against unknown attacks. On this basis, organisations can help reduce the risk of a cyberattack by providing access to past and current cybersecurity events through blockchain smart contracts and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The suggested combination of technologies can make organisational systems more reliable and secure, improving system automation and data quality. This paper outlines a privacy-preserving mechanism for threat information sharing in a trusted way. It proposes a reliable and secure architecture for data automation, quality, and traceability based on the Hyperledger Fabric private-permissioned distributed ledger technology and the MITRE ATT&CK threat intelligence framework. This methodology can also be applied to combat intellectual property theft and industrial espionage.",

    "abstract": "Sharing knowledge such as resources, research results, and scholarly documents, is of key importance to improving collaboration between researchers worldwide. Research results from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) are vital to share because of the extensive applicability of AI to several other fields of research. This has led to a significant increase in the number of AI publications over the past decade. The metadata of AI publications, including bibliometrics and altmetrics indicators, can be accessed by searching familiar bibliographical databases such as Web of Science (WoS), which enables the impact of research to be evaluated and identify rising researchers and trending topics in the field of AI.\nIn general, bibliographical databases have two limitations in terms of the type and form of metadata we aim to improve. First, most bibliographical databases, such as WoS, are more concerned with bibliometric indicators and do not offer a wide range of altmetric indicators to complement traditional bibliometric indicators. Second, the traditional format in which data is downloaded from bibliographical databases limits users to keyword-based searches without considering the semantics of the data.\nTo overcome these limitations, we developed a repository, named AI-SPedia. The repository contains semantic knowledge of scientific publications concerned with AI and considers both the bibliometric and altmetric indicators. Moreover, it uses semantic web technology to produce and store data to enable semantic-based searches. Furthermore, we devised related competency questions to be answered by posing smart queries against the AI-SPedia datasets.\nThe results revealed that AI-SPedia can evaluate the impact of AI research by exploiting knowledge that is not explicitly mentioned but extracted using the power of semantics. Moreover, a simple analysis was performed based on the answered questions to help make research policy decisions in the AI domain. The end product, AI-SPedia, is considered the first attempt to evaluate the impacts of AI scientific publications using both bibliometric and altmetric indicators and the power of semantic web technology.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is a primary public health issue globally and in our country, which continues to increase due to poor awareness of the disease and lack of necessary preventive measures. COPD is the result of a blockage of the air sacs known as alveoli within the lungs; it is a persistent sickness that causes difficulty in breathing, cough, and shortness of breath. COPD is characterized by breathing signs and symptoms and airflow challenge because of anomalies in the airways and alveoli that occurs as the result of significant exposure to harmful particles and gases. The spirometry test (breath measurement test), used for diagnosing COPD, is creating difficulties in reaching hospitals, especially in patients with disabilities or advanced disease and in children. To facilitate the diagnostic treatment and prevent these problems, it is far evaluated that using photoplethysmography (PPG) signal in the diagnosis of COPD disease would be beneficial in order to simplify and speed up the diagnosis process and make it more convenient for monitoring. A PPG signal includes numerous components, including volumetric changes in arterial blood that are related to heart activity, fluctuations in venous blood volume that modify the PPG signal, a direct current (DC) component that shows the optical properties of the tissues, and modest energy changes in the body. PPG has typically received the usage of a pulse oximeter, which illuminates the pores and skin and measures adjustments in mild absorption. PPG occurring with every heart rate is an easy signal to measure. PPG signal is modeled by machine learning to predict COPD.\nDuring the studies, the PPG signal was cleaned of noise, and a brand-new PPG signal having three low-frequency bands of the PPG was obtained. Each of the four signals extracted 25 features. An aggregate of 100 features have been extracted. Additionally, weight, height, and age were also used as characteristics. In the feature selection process, we employed the Fisher method. The intention of using this method is to improve performance.\nThis improved PPG prediction models have an accuracy rate of 0.95 performance value for all individuals. Classification algorithms used in feature selection algorithm has contributed to a performance increase.\nAccording to the findings, PPG-based COPD prediction models are suitable for usage in practice.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unique among malignancies, and its characteristics on contrast imaging modalities allow for a highly accurate diagnosis. The radiological differentiation of focal liver lesions is playing an increasingly important role, and the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System adopts a combination of major features including arterial phase hyper-enhancement (APHE) and the washout pattern.\nSpecific HCCs such as well or poorly differentiated type, subtypes including fibrolamellar or sarcomatoid and combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma do not often demonstrate APHE and washout appearance. Meanwhile, hypervascular liver metastases and hypervascular intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma can demonstrate APHE and washout. There are still other hypervascular malignant liver tumors (i.e., angiosarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma) and hypervascular benign liver lesions (i.e., adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, angiomyolipoma, flash filling hemangioma, reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, inflammatory lesion, arterioportal shunt), which need to be distinguished from HCC. When a patient has chronic liver disease, differential diagnosis of hypervascular liver lesions can be even more complicated. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine has been widely explored, and recent advancement in the field of deep learning has provided promising performance for the analysis of medical images, especially radiological imaging data contain diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive information which AI can extract. The AI research studies have demonstrated high accuracy (over 90% accuracy) for classifying lesions with typical imaging features from some hepatic lesions. The AI system has a potential to be implemented in clinical routine as decision support tools. However, for the differential diagnosis of many types of hypervascular liver lesions, further large-scale clinical validation is still required.\nClinicians should be aware of the histopathological features, imaging characteristics, and differential diagnoses of hypervascular liver lesions to a precise diagnosis and more valuable treatment plan. We need to be familiar with such atypical cases to prevent a diagnostic delay, but AI-based tools also need to learn a large number of typical and atypical cases.",

    "abstract": "It has been shown that intelligence as a general mental ability is related to the structure and function of the brain regions. However, the specificity of these regional dependencies to the intelligence scores in the typical and atypical developed individuals needs to be well understood. In this study, we hypothesized that neural correlates of IQ should not have a fixed pattern rather they must follow a dynamic pattern to compensate for the functional deficits caused by a neurodevelopmental disorder. Therefore, electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of normal IQ in various subtypes of attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) were compared with a group of healthy controls.\nSixty-three ADHD subjects comprising combined, inattentive, and hyperactive individuals diagnosed by a psychiatrist using structural clinical interview for DSM-V, and 46 healthy controls with similar normal IQ scores were recruited in this study. The subjects' EEG data were then recorded during an eye-closed resting condition. The subjects' intelligence level was measured by Raven's standard progressive matrices. Then, the association between IQ and the power of the EEG signal was computed in the conventional frequency bands. Subsequently, topographical representations of these associations were compared between the groups.\nOur results demonstrated that the association between IQ score and EEG power is not the same in various ADHD subtypes and healthy controls.\nThis finding suggests a compensatory mechanism in ADHD individuals for changing the regional oscillatory pattern to maintain the IQ within a normal range.",

The search strategy was elaborated with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Boolean operators. The analysis of bibliometric indicators was performed with Elsevier's SciVal program.\nFrom 2017 to 2022, the number of publications in indexed scientific journals increased, especially in the Q1 (56.1%) and Q2 (30.6%) quartile. Among the journals with the highest production, the majority was from the United States and the United Kingdom, and the Journal of Dental Research has the highest impact (14.9 citations per publication) and the most publications (31). In addition, the Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin (FWCI: 8.24) and Krois Joachim (FWCI: 10.09) from Germany were the institution and author with the highest expected performance relative to the world average, respectively. The United States is the country with the highest number of published papers.\nThere is an increasing tendency to increase the scientific production on artificial intelligence in the field of dentistry, with a preference for publication in prestigious scientific journals of high impact.

    "abstract": "A longstanding challenge surrounding deep learning algorithms is unpacking and understanding how they make their decisions. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) offers methods to provide explanations of internal functions of algorithms and reasons behind their decisions in ways that are interpretable and understandable to human users. . Numerous XAI approaches have been developed thus far, and a comparative analysis of these strategies seems necessary to discern their relevance to clinical prediction models. To this end, we first implemented two prediction models for short- and long-term outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI) utilizing structured tabular as well as time-series physiologic data, respectively. Six different interpretation techniques were used to describe both prediction models at the local and global levels. We then performed a critical analysis of merits and drawbacks of each strategy, highlighting the implications for researchers who are interested in applying these methodologies. The implemented methods were compared to one another in terms of several XAI characteristics such as understandability, fidelity, and stability. Our findings show that SHAP is the most stable with the highest fidelity but falls short of understandability. Anchors, on the other hand, is the most understandable approach, but it is only applicable to tabular data and not time series data.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare must deliver high quality, high value, patient-centric care while improving access and costs even as aging and active populations increase demand for services like knee arthroplasty. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) using past clinical data primarily replicates existing cause-to-effect actions. This is insufficient to forecast outcomes, costs, resource utilization and complications when radical process re-engineering like COVID- inspired telemedicine occurs. To predict episodes of care for innovative arthroplasty patient journeys, a sophisticated integrated knowledge network must model optimal novel care pathways. We focus on the first step of the patient journey: shared surgical decision making. Patient engagement is critical to successful outcomes, yet existing methods cannot model impact of specific decision variables like interactive clinician/caregiver/patient participation in pre- and post-operative rehabilitation, and other factors like comorbidities. We demonstrate coupling of simulation and AI/ML for augmented intelligence musculoskeletal virtual care decisions for knee arthroplasty. This novel coupled-solution integrates critical data and information with tacit clinician knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) programs that train on large datasets require powerful compute infrastructure consisting of several CPU cores and GPUs. JupyterLab provides an excellent framework for developing AI programs, but it needs to be hosted on such an infrastructure to enable faster training of AI programs using parallel computing.\nAn open-source, docker-based, and GPU-enabled JupyterLab infrastructure is developed that runs on the public compute infrastructure of Galaxy Europe consisting of thousands of CPU cores, many GPUs, and several petabytes of storage to rapidly prototype and develop end-to-end AI projects. Using a JupyterLab notebook, long-running AI model training programs can also be executed remotely to create trained models, represented in open neural network exchange (ONNX) format, and other output datasets in Galaxy. Other features include Git integration for version control, the option of creating and executing pipelines of notebooks, and multiple dashboards and packages for monitoring compute resources and visualization, respectively.\nThese features make JupyterLab in Galaxy Europe highly suitable for creating and managing AI projects. A recent scientific publication that predicts infected regions in COVID-19 computed tomography scan images is reproduced using various features of JupyterLab on Galaxy Europe. In addition, ColabFold, a faster implementation of AlphaFold2, is accessed in JupyterLab to predict the 3-dimensional structure of protein sequences. JupyterLab is accessible in 2 ways-one as an interactive Galaxy tool and the other by running the underlying Docker container. In both ways, long-running training can be executed on Galaxy's compute infrastructure. Scripts to create the Docker container are available under MIT license at https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/gpu-jupyterlab-docker.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in mental healthcare offers a potential solution to some of the problems associated with the availability, attractiveness, and accessibility of mental healthcare services. However, there are many knowledge gaps regarding how to implement and best use AI to add value to mental healthcare services, providers, and consumers. The aim of this paper is to identify challenges and opportunities for AI use in mental healthcare and to describe key insights from implementation science of potential relevance to understand and facilitate AI implementation in mental healthcare.\nThe paper is based on a selective review of articles concerning AI in mental healthcare and implementation science.\nResearch in implementation science has established the importance of considering and planning for implementation from the start, the progression of implementation through different stages, and the appreciation of determinants at multiple levels. Determinant frameworks and implementation theories have been developed to understand and explain how different determinants impact on implementation. AI research should explore the relevance of these determinants for AI implementation. Implementation strategies to support AI implementation must address determinants specific to AI implementation in mental health. There might also be a need to develop new theoretical approaches or augment and recontextualize existing ones. Implementation outcomes may have to be adapted to be relevant in an AI implementation context.\nKnowledge derived from implementation science could provide an important starting point for research on implementation of AI in mental healthcare. This field has generated many insights and provides a broad range of theories, frameworks, and concepts that are likely relevant for this research. However, when taking advantage of the existing knowledge basis, it is important to also be explorative and study AI implementation in health and mental healthcare as a new phenomenon in its own right since implementing AI may differ in various ways from implementing evidence-based practices in terms of what implementation determinants, strategies, and outcomes are most relevant.",

    "results": "Research in implementation science has established the importance of considering and planning for implementation from the start, the progression of implementation through different stages, and the appreciation of determinants at multiple levels. Determinant frameworks and implementation theories have been developed to understand and explain how different determinants impact on implementation. AI research should explore the relevance of these determinants for AI implementation. Implementation strategies to support AI implementation must address determinants specific to AI implementation in mental health. There might also be a need to develop new theoretical approaches or augment and recontextualize existing ones. Implementation outcomes may have to be adapted to be relevant in an AI implementation context.",

    "abstract": "Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is a novel heart-rate-based metric used to assess cardiorespiratory fitness and quantify physical activity.\nThe aim of this study was to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of PAI with patients in a clinic setting.\nPatients (n = 25) from 2 clinics underwent 12 weeks of heart-rate-monitored physical activity interfaced with aPAI Health phone app. We used a pre-post design with the Physical Activity Vital Sign and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Feasibility, acceptability, and PAI measures were used to evaluate the objectives.\nTwenty-two patients (88%) completed the study. There were significant improvements in International Physical Activity Questionnaire metabolic equivalent task minutes per week ( P = .046) and a decrease in sitting hours ( P = .0001). The Physical Activity Vital Sign activity increase in minutes per week was not significant ( P = .214). Patients achieved a mean PAI score of 116 \u00b1 81.1 and 100 or greater 71% of the days. Most patients (81%) expressed satisfaction with PAI.\nPersonal Activity Intelligence is feasible, acceptable, and effective when used with patients in a clinic setting.",

    "abstract": "A major opportunity in nuclear cardiology is the many significant artificial intelligence (AI) applications that have recently been reported. These developments include using deep learning (DL) for reducing the needed injected dose and acquisition time in perfusion acquisitions also due to DL improvements in image reconstruction and filtering, SPECT attenuation correction using DL without need for transmission images, DL and machine learning (ML) use for feature extraction to define myocardial left ventricular (LV) borders for functional measurements and improved detection of the LV valve plane and AI, ML, and DL implementations for MPI diagnosis, prognosis, and structured reporting. Although some have, most of these applications have yet to make it to widespread commercial distribution due to the recency of their developments, most reported in 2020. We must be prepared both technically and socio-economically to fully benefit from these and a tsunami of other AI applications that are coming.",

This educational piece discusses the implementation of AI and its impact on sonography. The authors investigate how AI may influence the profession and provide examples of how ultrasound imaging may be enhanced and innovated by integrating AI technology. This article highlights challenges related to the application of AI and provides insight into how they could be addressed. The critical distinction between the role of a sonographer and the reporting specialist in the context of AI is highlighted as a key issue for those developing, researching, and evaluating AI systems. A key recommendation is for the sonography community to address ultrasound education, particularly how AI knowledge could be incorporated into university education. This is an important consideration that should be extended to practising professionals as they may be involved in evaluating the efficiency and methodologies used in new research that may incorporate AI technologies.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) is defined by the ability to perceive, manage, and reason about emotions in oneself and others. Studies have reported deficits in EI abilities among certain antisocial populations such as individuals with psychopathy, and enhanced performance among sexual offenders. Despite EI's relevance to offending behaviour, the association between EI and paraphilic offending has been under-studied. We examined the association between EI, sexual offending, and sexual sadism in 80 incarcerated men with sexual offenses and 207 incarcerated men with non-sexual offences. EI was assessed using the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). Sadism was measured using the Severe Sexual Sadism Scale (SeSaS). Results showed that SeSaS scores were positively associated with Strategic EI (the ability to understand and manage emotions), but were not significantly related to Experiential EI. This may reflect core characteristics of sexual sadism including domination and manipulation, challenging the prevalent notion that higher EI is invariably positive.",

    "abstract": "Context: Qualitative research - crucial for understanding human behavior - remains underutilized, in part due to the time and cost of annotating qualitative data (coding). Artificial intelligence (AI) has been suggested as a means to reduce those burdens. Older AI techniques (Latent Semantic Indexing / Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LSI/LDA)) have fallen short, in part because qualitative data is rife with idiom, non-standard expressions, and jargon. Objective: To develop an AI platform using updated techniques to augment qualitative data coding. Study Design and Analysis: We previously completed traditional qualitative analysis of a large dataset, with 11 qualitative categories and 72 subcategories (categories), and a final Cohen's kappa \u2265 0.65 as a measure of human inter-coder reliability (ICR) after coding. We built our Automated Qualitative Assistant (AQUA) using a semi-classical approach, replacing LSI/LDA with a graph-theoretic topic extraction and clustering method. AQUA was given the previously-identified qualitative categories and tasked with coding free-text data into those categories. Item coding was scored using cosine-similarity. Population Studied: Pennsylvanian adults. Instrument: Free-text responses to five open ended questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. \"What worries you most about the COVID-19 pandemic?\"). Outcome Measures: AQUA's coding was compared to human coding using Cohen's kappa. This was done on all categories in aggregate, and also on category clusters to identify category groups amenable to AQUA support. AQUA's time to complete coding was compared to the time taken by the human coding team. Dataset: Five unlimited free-text survey answers from 538 responders. Results: AQUA's kappa for all categories was low (kappa~0.45), reflecting the challenge of automated analysis of diverse language. However, for several 3-category combinations (with less linguistic diversity), AQUA performed comparably to human coders, with an ICR kappa range of 0.62 to 0.72 based on test-train split. AQUA's analysis (including human interpretation) took approximately 5 hours, compared to approximately 30 person hours for traditional coding. Conclusions: AQUA enables qualitative researchers to identify categories amenable to automated coding, and to rapidly conduct that coding on the entirety of very large datasets. This saves time and money, and avoids limitations inherent in limiting qualitative analysis to limited samples of a given dataset.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely seen as critical for tackling fundamental challenges faced by health systems. However, research is scant on the factors that influence the implementation and routine use of AI in healthcare, how AI may interact with the context in which it is implemented, and how it can contribute to wider health system goals. We propose that AI development can benefit from knowledge generated in four scientific fields: intervention, innovation, implementation and improvement sciences.\nThe aim of this paper is to briefly describe the four fields and to identify potentially relevant knowledge from these fields that can be utilized for understanding and/or facilitating the use of AI in healthcare. The paper is based on the authors' experience and expertise in intervention, innovation, implementation, and improvement sciences, and a selective literature review.\nThe four fields have generated a wealth of often-overlapping knowledge, some of which we propose has considerable relevance for understanding and/or facilitating the use of AI in healthcare.\nKnowledge derived from intervention, innovation, implementation, and improvement sciences provides a head start for research on the use of AI in healthcare, yet the extent to which this knowledge can be repurposed in AI studies cannot be taken for granted. Thus, when taking advantage of insights in the four fields, it is important to also be explorative and use inductive research approaches to generate knowledge that can contribute toward realizing the potential of AI in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a significant transformation of health care in all medical areas, which could represent \"Gutenberg moment\" for medicine. The future of medical specialties came largely from human interaction and creativity, forcing physicians to evolve and use AI as a tool in patient care. AI will offer patients safety, autonomy, and access to timely medical care in hard-to-reach areas while reducing administrative burden, screen time, and professional burnout for physicians. AI will also make it possible to reduce the frequency of medical errors and improve diagnostic accuracy through the integration, analysis, and interpretation of information by algorithms and software. The safety of repetitive activities will free up time for health personnel and will enhance the doctor-patient relationship, return to personalized attention and interaction with the patient, through accompaniment, communication, empathy, and trust during illness, activities that will never be replaced by AI. It is still necessary to standardize research in the area, which allows improving the quality of scientific evidence knowing its advantages and risks, accelerating its implementation in current medical practice.\nLa inteligencia artificial (IA) promete una transformaci\u00f3n significativa del cuidado de la salud en todas las \u00e1reas m\u00e9dicas, lo que podr\u00eda representar el \u00abmomento Gutenberg\u00bb para la medicina. El futuro de las especialidades m\u00e9dicas depender\u00e1 en gran medida de la interacci\u00f3n humana y la creatividad, obligando a los m\u00e9dicos a evolucionar y emplear la IA como una herramienta en la atenci\u00f3n del enfermo. La IA ofrecer\u00e1 a los pacientes seguridad, autonom\u00eda y posibilidad de atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica oportuna en zonas de dif\u00edcil acceso, y a los m\u00e9dicos les ayudar\u00e1 a disminuir la carga administrativa, el tiempo en pantallas y el agotamiento profesional. La IA permitir\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n reducir la frecuencia de errores m\u00e9dicos y mejorar la precisi\u00f3n diagn\u00f3stica a trav\u00e9s de la integraci\u00f3n, el an\u00e1lisis y la interpretaci\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n por algoritmos y software.

    "abstract": "The whole universe is facing a coronavirus catastrophe, and prompt treatment for the health crisis is primarily significant. The primary way to improve health conditions in this battle is to boost our immunity and alter our diet patterns. A common bulb veggie used to flavor cuisine is garlic. Compounds in the plant that are physiologically active are present, contributing to its pharmacological characteristics. Among several food items with nutritional value and immunity improvement, garlic stood predominant and more resourceful natural antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antiviral potency against diverse viruses. However, earlier reports have depicted its efficacy in the treatment of a variety of viral illnesses. Nonetheless, there is no information on its antiviral activities and underlying molecular mechanisms.\nThe bioactive compounds in garlic include organosulfur (allicin and alliin) and flavonoid (quercetin) compounds. These compounds have shown immunomodulatory effects and inhibited attachment of coronavirus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the Mpro of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Further, we have discussed the contradictory impacts of garlic used as a preventive measure against the novel coronavirus.\nThe GC/MS analysis revealed 18 active chemicals, including 17 organosulfur compounds in garlic. Using the molecular docking technique, we report for the first time the inhibitory effect of the under-consideration compounds on the host receptor ACE2 protein in the human body, providing a crucial foundation for understanding individual compound coronavirus resistance on the main protease protein of SARS-CoV-2. Allyl disulfide and allyl trisulfide, which make up the majority of the compounds in garlic, exhibit the most potent activity.\nConventional medicine has proven its efficiency from ancient times. Currently, our article's prime spotlight was on the activity of \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has triggered interest among researchers to conduct future research on molecular docking with clinical trials before releasing salutary remedies against the deadly malady.",

    "abstract": "A significant study has been undertaken in the areas of health care and administration of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technologies throughout the previous decade. Healthcare professionals studied smart gadgets and other medical technologies, along with the AI-based Internet of Things (IoT) (AIoT). Connecting the two regions makes sense in terms of improving care for rural and isolated resident individuals. The healthcare industry has made tremendous strides in efficiency, affordability, and usefulness as a result of new research options and major cost reductions. This includes instructions (AIoT-based) medical advancements can be both beneficial and detrimental. While the IoT concept undoubtedly offers a number of benefits, it also poses fundamental security and privacy concerns regarding medical data. However, resource-constrained AIoT devices are vulnerable to a number of assaults, which can significantly impair their performance. Cryptographic algorithms used in the past are inadequate for safeguarding IoT-enabled networks, presenting substantial security risks. The AIoT is made up of three layers: perception, network, and application, all of which are vulnerable to security threats. These threats can be aggressive or passive in nature, and they can originate both within and outside the network. Numerous IoT security issues, including replay, sniffing, and eavesdropping, have the ability to obstruct network communication. The AIoT-H application is likely to be explored in this research article due to its potential to aid with existing and different technologies, as well as bring useful solutions to healthcare security challenges. Additionally, every day, several potential problems and inconsistencies with the AIoT-H technique have been discovered.",

    "abstract": "This scoping review aims to identify and describe the instruments used to evaluate emotional intelligence in deaf and hard of hearing (D/HH) persons.\nEmotional intelligence is a person's ability to work with emotions in response to a particular situation. Deafness or a hard of hearing has a negative effect on functioning in the field of emotional intelligence and leads to a specific approach to the diagnosis or evaluation of emotional intelligence.\nThe scoping review will consider studies focused on persons who are deaf or hard of hearing at any age. The review will consider studies that feature existing instruments and the process of the evaluation of emotional intelligence in people with hearing disabilities. Relevant information will include the type, extent, and form of possible modification of specific instruments and approaches. Criteria for the exclusion of the study will be in terms of the target category being persons with a cochlear implant, psychiatric diagnoses, persons who have become deaf, and persons with multiple disabilities.\nThe review will be conducted following the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. The databases to be searched include MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, ProQuest Central, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, Clinical Trials, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Google Scholar.

    "abstract": "Cerebrovascular disease refers to damage to brain tissue caused by impaired intracranial blood circulation. It usually presents clinically as an acute nonfatal event and is characterized by high morbidity, disability, and mortality. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography is a non-invasive method for the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease that uses the Doppler effect to detect the hemodynamic and physiological parameters of the major intracranial basilar arteries. It can provide important hemodynamic information that cannot be measured by other diagnostic imaging techniques for cerebrovascular disease. And the result parameters of TCD ultrasonography such as blood flow velocity and beat index can reflect the type of cerebrovascular disease and serve as a basis to assist physicians in the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science which is used in a wide range of applications in agriculture, communications, medicine, finance, and other fields. In recent years, there are much research devoted to the application of AI to TCD. The review and summary of related technologies is an important work to promote the development of this field, which can provide an intuitive technical summary for future researchers. In this paper, we first review the development, principles, and applications of TCD ultrasonography and other related knowledge, and briefly introduce the development of AI in the field of medicine and emergency medicine. Finally, we summarize in detail the applications and advantages of AI technology in TCD ultrasonography including the establishment of an examination system combining brain computer interface (BCI) and TCD ultrasonography, the classification and noise cancellation of TCD ultrasonography signals using AI algorithms, and the use of intelligent robots to assist physicians in TCD ultrasonography and discuss the prospects for the development of AI in TCD ultrasonography.",

    "abstract": "We present interesting application of artificial intelligence for investigating effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on 3-dimensional temperature variation across Nigeria (2\u00b0-15\u00b0 E, 4\u00b0-14\u00b0 N), in equatorial Africa. Artificial neural networks were trained to learn time-series temperature variation patterns using radio occultation measurements of atmospheric temperature from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC). Data used for training, validation and testing of the neural networks covered period prior to the lockdown. There was also an investigation into the viability of solar activity indicator (represented by the sunspot number) as an input for the process. The results indicated that including the sunspot number as an input for the training did not improve the network prediction accuracy. The trained network was then used to predict values for the lockdown period. Since the network was trained using pre-lockdown dataset, predictions from the network are regarded as expected temperatures, should there have been no lockdown. By comparing with the actual COSMIC measurements during the lockdown period, effects of the lockdown on atmospheric temperatures were deduced. In overall, the mean altitudinal temperatures rose by about 1.1\u00a0\u00b0C above expected values during the lockdown. An altitudinal breakdown, at 1\u00a0km resolution, reveals that the values were typically below 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C at most of the altitudes, but exceeded 1\u00a0\u00b0C at 28 and 29\u00a0km altitudes. The temperatures were also observed to drop below expected values at altitudes of 0-2\u00a0km, and 17-20\u00a0km.",

    "abstract": "Along with the popularity of smartphones, artificial intelligence-based personalized suggestions can be seen as promising ways to change eating habits toward more desirable diets.\nTwo issues raised by such technologies were addressed in this study. The first hypothesis tested is a recommender system based on automatically learning simple association rules between dishes of the same meal that would make it possible to identify plausible substitutions for the consumer. The second hypothesis tested is that for an identical set of dietary-swaps suggestions, the more the user is-or thinks to be-involved in the process of identifying the suggestion, the higher is their probability of accepting the suggestion.\nThree studies are presented in this article, first, we present the principles of an algorithm to mine plausible substitutions from a large food consumption database. Second, we evaluate the plausibility of these automatically mined suggestions through the results of online tests conducted for a group of 255 adult participants. Afterward, we investigated the persuasiveness of 3 suggestion methods of such recommendations in a population of 27 healthy adult volunteers through a custom designed smartphone application.\nThe results firstly indicated that a method based on automatic learning of substitution rules between foods performed relatively well identifying plausible swaps suggestions. Regarding the form that should be used to suggest, we found that when users are involved in selecting the most appropriate recommendation for them, the resulting suggestions were more accepted (OR = 3.168; P < 0.0004).\nThis work indicates that food recommendation algorithms can gain efficiency by taking into account the consumption context and user engagement in the recommendation process. Further research is warranted to identify nutritionally relevant suggestions.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the retinal vascular morphological characteristics in high myopia patients of different severity.\n317 eyes of high myopia patients and 104 eyes of healthy control subjects were included in this study. The severity of high myopia patients is classified into C0-C4 according to the Meta Analysis of the Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) classification and their vascular morphological characteristics in ultra-wide field imaging were analyzed using transfer learning methods and RU-net. Correlation with axial length (AL), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and age was analyzed. In addition, the vascular morphological characteristics of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) patients and their matched high myopia patients were compared.\nThe RU-net and transfer learning system of blood vessel segmentation had an accuracy of 98.24%, a sensitivity of 71.42%, a specificity of 99.37%, a precision of 73.68% and a F1 score of 72.29. Compared with healthy control group, high myopia group had smaller vessel angle (31.12 \u00b1 2.27 vs. 32.33 \u00b1 2.14), smaller fractal dimension (Df) (1.383 \u00b1 0.060 vs. 1.424 \u00b1 0.038), smaller vessel density (2.57 \u00b1 0.96 vs. 3.92 \u00b1 0.93) and fewer vascular branches (201.87 \u00b1 75.92 vs. 271.31 \u00b1 67.37), all \nThe RU-net and transfer learning technology used in this study has an accuracy of 98.24%, thus has good performance in quantitative analysis of vascular morphological characteristics in Ultra-wide field images. Along with the increase of myopic maculopathy severity and the elongation of eyeball, vessel angle, Df, vessel density and vascular branches decreased.

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal endoscopy has been identified as an important tool for cancer diagnosis and therapy, particularly for treating patients with early gastric cancer (EGC). It is well known that the quality of gastroscope images is a prerequisite for achieving a high detection rate of gastrointestinal lesions. Owing to manual operation of gastroscope detection, in practice, it possibly introduces motion blur and produces low-quality gastroscope images during the imaging process. Hence, the quality assessment of gastroscope images is the key process in the detection of gastrointestinal endoscopy. In this study, we first present a novel gastroscope image motion blur (GIMB) database that includes 1,050 images generated by imposing 15 distortion levels of motion blur on 70 lossless images and the associated subjective scores produced with the manual operation of 15 viewers. Then, we design a new artificial intelligence (AI)-based gastroscope image quality evaluator (GIQE) that leverages the newly proposed semi-full combination subspace to learn multiple kinds of human visual system (HVS) inspired features for providing objective quality scores. The results of experiments conducted on the GIMB database confirm that the proposed GIQE showed more effective performance compared with its state-of-the-art peers.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad term referring to any automated systems that need 'intelligence' to carry out specific tasks. During the last decade, AI-based techniques have been gaining popularity in a vast range of biomedical fields, including the cardiovascular setting. Indeed, the dissemination of cardiovascular risk factors and the better prognosis of patients experiencing cardiovascular events resulted in an increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), eliciting the need for precise identification of patients at increased risk for development and progression of CVD. AI-based predictive models may overcome some of the limitations that hinder the performance of classic regression models. Nonetheless, the successful application of AI in this field requires knowledge of the potential pitfalls of the AI techniques, to guarantee their safe and effective use in daily clinical practice. The aim of the present review is to summarise the pros and cons of different AI methods and their potential application in the cardiovascular field, with a focus on the development of predictive models and risk assessment tools.",

    "abstract": "Carcinoid heart disease is increasingly recognized and challenging to manage due to limited outcomes data. This is the largest known cohort study of valvular pathology, treatment (including pulmonary and tricuspid valve replacements [PVR and TVR]), dispairties, mortality, and cost in patients with malignant carcinoid tumor (MCT).\nMachine learning-augmented propensity score-adjusted multivariable regression was conducted for clincal outcomes in the 2016-2018 U.S. National Inpatient Sample (NIS). Regression models were weighted by the complex survey design and adjusted for known confounders and the likelihood of undergoing valvular procedures.\nAmong 101,521,656 hospitalizations, 55,910 (0.06%) had MCT. Patients with MCT vs. those without had significantly higher inpatient mortality (2.93 vs. 2.04%, \nThis analysis reflects a favorable trend in recognizing the need for TVR and PVR in patients with MCT, with associated increased cost but not mortality. Our study also suggests that pulmonic valve pathology is increasingly recognized in MCT as reflected by the upward trend in PVRs.

    "abstract": "Total health care spending in the United States is increasing. In order to improve our delivery of high-quality, patient-centric, and cost-effective care, artificial intelligence (AI) and its subsets are being increasingly explored and utilized in medicine. Applications of AI in orthopedic surgery, including shoulder and elbow surgery, are being actively studied and have stirred much discussion. However, the trends of research on AI applications in shoulder and elbow surgery have not yet been quantified. Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore the general trends of research in applying AI to shoulder and elbow surgery and to examine characteristics of these research publications.\nA literature search was conducted using PubMed for all articles published between January 1, 2000 and May 12, 2022. The primary search query used was as follows: (shoulder) and (AI OR machine learning OR deep learning OR neural networks). Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) not pertinent to orthopedic surgeons (2) not pertaining to shoulder or elbow surgery, and (3) not pertaining to AI, machine learning, and deep learning. Selected articles in high-impact and relevant orthopedic journals were further characterized and analyzed.\nThe annual number of articles increased from 1 article in 2006 to 24 articles in 2021. There was a 4-fold increase in publications between 2019 and 2021, and a 6-fold increase between 2018 and 2021. The average number of publications per year increased exponentially from 2010 to 2021 (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.608; \nThis study provides quantitative evidence for the first time that publications applying AI and its subsets to shoulder and elbow surgery are growing exponentially since the year 2010, with the most rapid growth beginning between the years of 2019 and\u00a02020.",

    "abstract": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in different populations, and it is very challenging to manage heterogeneous patient groups. Artificial intelligence (AI) aids in interpreting complex data of patients with ARDS and can be used to detect adverse events as it can automatically capture complex relationships. This review aimed to explore the application and progress of AI in ARDS (e.g., subgroup classification of patients with ARDS via unsupervised clustering and supervised predictive models for early detection) and identify the current ARDS-related problems that can be solved using AI.\nThis comprehensive and narrative review was performed to obtain information about the application of AI in ARDS and summarize its subtypes and predictive models.\nThe current applications of AI and machine learning in ARDS include ARDS subgroup classification, diagnosis, and survival prediction. In this review, the current problems that should be addressed by AI in ARDS were identified, and our findings may serve as a useful reference for its translational use in the ARDS field.\nOwing to the discovery of hyper- and hypoinflammatory subtypes, individualized treatment of ARDS is possible, and diagnosis and survival prediction are essential in disease management and planning. However, prospective studies should clarify the reliability and generalizability of the results using AI and machine learning and performing bedside testing in larger populations to establish a more stable and time-resilient model. Therefore, a consensus on conducting and reporting machine learning studies in medicine should be urgently established.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in the use of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma are discussed. To set the context and fix terminology, a brief historic overview of artificial intelligence is provided, along with some fundamentals of statistical modeling. Next, recent applications of artificial intelligence techniques in glaucoma diagnosis and the monitoring of glaucoma progression are reviewed, including the classification of visual field images and the detection of glaucomatous change in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Current challenges in the direct application of artificial intelligence to further our understating of this disease are also outlined. The article also discusses how the combined use of mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence may help to address these challenges, along with stronger communication between data scientists and clinicians.",

    "abstract": "Medical students will likely be most impacted by the envisaged move to artificial intelligence (AI) driven digital medicine, and there is a need to better understand their views regarding the use of AI technology in medicine. This study aimed to explore German medical students\u00b4 views about AI in medicine.\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted in October 2019 with all new medical students at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Technical University Munich. This represented approximately 10% of all new medical students in Germany.\nA total of 844 medical students participated (91.9% response rate). Two thirds (64.4%) did not feel well informed about AI in medicine. Just over a half (57.4%) of students thought that AI has useful applications in medicine, particularly in drug research and development (82.5%), less so for clinical uses. Male students were more likely to agree with advantages of AI, and female participants were more likely to be concerned about disadvantages. The vast majority of students thought that when AI is used in medicine that it is important that there are legal rules regarding liability (97%) and oversight mechanisms (93.7%), that physicians should be consulted prior to implementation (96.8%), that developers should be able to explain to them the details of the algorithm (95.6%), that algorithms should use representative data (93.9%), and that patients should always be informed when AI is used (93.5%).\nMedical schools and continuing medical education organisers need to promptly develop programs to ensure that clinicians are able to fully realize the potential of AI technology. It is also important that legal rules and oversight are implemented to ensure that future clinicians are not faced with a workplace where important issues around responsibility are not clearly regulated.",

    "abstract": "Mental health conditions can have significant negative impacts on wellbeing and healthcare systems. Despite their high prevalence worldwide, there is still insufficient recognition and accessible treatments. Many mobile apps are available to the general population that aim to support mental health needs; however, there is limited evidence of their effectiveness. Mobile apps for mental health are beginning to incorporate artificial intelligence and there is a need for an overview of the state of the literature on these apps. The purpose of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the current research landscape and knowledge gaps regarding the use of artificial intelligence in mobile health apps for mental health. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) and Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study types (PICOS) frameworks were used to structure the review and the search. PubMed was systematically searched for randomised controlled trials and cohort studies published in English since 2014 that evaluate artificial intelligence- or machine learning-enabled mobile apps for mental health support. Two reviewers collaboratively screened references (MMI and EM), selected studies for inclusion based on the eligibility criteria and extracted the data (MMI and CL), which were synthesised in a descriptive analysis. 1,022 studies were identified in the initial search and 4 were included in the final review. The mobile apps investigated incorporated different artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques for a variety of purposes (risk prediction, classification, and personalisation) and aimed to address a wide range of mental health needs (depression, stress, and suicide risk). The studies' characteristics also varied in terms of methods, sample size, and study duration. Overall, the studies demonstrated the feasibility of using artificial intelligence to support mental health apps, but the early stages of the research and weaknesses in the study designs highlight the need for more research into artificial intelligence- and machine learning-enabled mental health apps and stronger evidence of their effectiveness. This research is essential and urgent, considering the easy availability of these apps to a large population.",

    "abstract": "Medical professionals have been burdened by clerical work, and artificial intelligence may efficiently support physicians by generating clinical summaries. However, whether hospital discharge summaries can be generated automatically from inpatient records stored in electronic health records remains unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the sources of information in discharge summaries. First, the discharge summaries were automatically split into fine-grained segments, such as those representing medical expressions, using a machine learning model from a previous study. Second, these segments in the discharge summaries that did not originate from inpatient records were filtered out. This was performed by calculating the n-gram overlap between inpatient records and discharge summaries. The final source origin decision was made manually. Finally, to reveal the specific sources (e.g., referral documents, prescriptions, and physician's memory) from which the segments originated, they were manually classified by consulting medical professionals. For further and deeper analysis, this study designed and annotated clinical role labels that represent the subjectivity of the expressions and builds a machine learning model to assign them automatically. The analysis results revealed the following: First, 39% of the information in the discharge summary originated from external sources other than inpatient records. Second, patient's past clinical records constituted 43%, and patient referral documents constituted 18% of the expressions derived from external sources. Third, 11% of the missing information was not derived from any documents. These are possibly derived from physicians' memories or reasoning. According to these results, end-to-end summarization using machine learning is considered infeasible. Machine summarization with an assisted post-editing process is the best fit for this problem domain.",

    "abstract": "Research into using artificial intelligence (AI) in health care is growing and several observers predicted that AI would play a key role in the clinical response to the COVID-19. Many AI models have been proposed though previous reviews have identified only a few applications used in clinical practice. In this study, we aim to (1) identify and characterize AI applications used in the clinical response to COVID-19; (2) examine the timing, location, and extent of their use; (3) examine how they relate to pre-pandemic applications and the U.S. regulatory approval process; and (4) characterize the evidence that is available to support their use. We searched academic and grey literature sources to identify 66 AI applications that performed a wide range of diagnostic, prognostic, and triage functions in the clinical response to COVID-19. Many were deployed early in the pandemic and most were used in the U.S., other high-income countries, or China. While some applications were used to care for hundreds of thousands of patients, others were used to an unknown or limited extent. We found studies supporting the use of 39 applications, though few of these were independent evaluations and we found no clinical trials evaluating any application's impact on patient health. Due to limited evidence, it is impossible to determine the extent to which the clinical use of AI in the pandemic response has benefited patients overall. Further research is needed, particularly independent evaluations on AI application performance and health impacts in real-world care settings.",

    "abstract": "Breast ultrasound provides a first-line evaluation for breast masses, but the majority of the world lacks access to any form of diagnostic imaging. In this pilot study, we assessed the combination of artificial intelligence (Samsung S-Detect for Breast) with volume sweep imaging (VSI) ultrasound scans to evaluate the possibility of inexpensive, fully automated breast ultrasound acquisition and preliminary interpretation without an experienced sonographer or radiologist. This study was conducted using examinations from a curated data set from a previously published clinical study of breast VSI. Examinations in this data set were obtained by medical students without prior ultrasound experience who performed VSI using a portable Butterfly iQ ultrasound probe. Standard of care ultrasound exams were performed concurrently by an experienced sonographer using a high-end ultrasound machine. Expert-selected VSI images and standard of care images were input into S-Detect which output mass features and classification as \"possibly benign\" and \"possibly malignant.\" Subsequent comparison of the S-Detect VSI report was made between 1) the standard of care ultrasound report by an expert radiologist, 2) the standard of care ultrasound S-Detect report, 3) the VSI report by an expert radiologist, and 4) the pathological diagnosis. There were 115 masses analyzed by S-Detect from the curated data set. There was substantial agreement of the S-Detect interpretation of VSI among cancers, cysts, fibroadenomas, and lipomas to the expert standard of care ultrasound report (Cohen's \u03ba = 0.73 (0.57-0.9 95% CI), p<0.0001), the standard of care ultrasound S-Detect interpretation (Cohen's \u03ba = 0.79 (0.65-0.94 95% CI), p<0.0001), the expert VSI ultrasound report (Cohen's \u03ba = 0.73 (0.57-0.9 95% CI), p<0.0001), and the pathological diagnosis (Cohen's \u03ba = 0.80 (0.64-0.95 95% CI), p<0.0001). All pathologically proven cancers (n = 20) were designated as \"possibly malignant\" by S-Detect with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 86%. Integration of artificial intelligence and VSI could allow both acquisition and interpretation of ultrasound images without a sonographer and radiologist. This approach holds potential for increasing access to ultrasound imaging and therefore improving outcomes related to breast cancer in low- and middle- income countries.",

    "abstract": "Explainability for artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is a hotly debated topic. Our paper presents a review of the key arguments in favor and against explainability for AI-powered Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) applied to a concrete use case, namely an AI-powered CDSS currently used in the emergency call setting to identify patients with life-threatening cardiac arrest. More specifically, we performed a normative analysis using socio-technical scenarios to provide a nuanced account of the role of explainability for CDSSs for the concrete use case, allowing for abstractions to a more general level. Our analysis focused on three layers: technical considerations, human factors, and the designated system role in decision-making. Our findings suggest that whether explainability can provide added value to CDSS depends on several key questions: technical feasibility, the level of validation in case of explainable algorithms, the characteristics of the context in which the system is implemented, the designated role in the decision-making process, and the key user group(s). Thus, each CDSS will require an individualized assessment of explainability needs and we provide an example of how such an assessment could look like in practice.",

    "abstract": "While artificial intelligence (AI) offers possibilities of advanced clinical prediction and decision-making in healthcare, models trained on relatively homogeneous datasets, and populations poorly-representative of underlying diversity, limits generalisability and risks biased AI-based decisions. Here, we describe the landscape of AI in clinical medicine to delineate population and data-source disparities.\nWe performed a scoping review of clinical papers published in PubMed in 2019 using AI techniques. We assessed differences in dataset country source, clinical specialty, and author nationality, sex, and expertise. A manually tagged subsample of PubMed articles was used to train a model, leveraging transfer-learning techniques (building upon an existing BioBERT model) to predict eligibility for inclusion (original, human, clinical AI literature). Of all eligible articles, database country source and clinical specialty were manually labelled. A BioBERT-based model predicted first/last author expertise. Author nationality was determined using corresponding affiliated institution information using Entrez Direct. And first/last author sex was evaluated using the Gendarize.io API.\nOur search yielded 30,576 articles, of which 7,314 (23.9%) were eligible for further analysis. Most databases came from the US (40.8%) and China (13.7%). Radiology was the most represented clinical specialty (40.4%), followed by pathology (9.1%). Authors were primarily from either China (24.0%) or the US (18.4%). First and last authors were predominately data experts (i.e., statisticians) (59.6% and 53.9% respectively) rather than clinicians. And the majority of first/last authors were male (74.1%).\nU.S. and Chinese datasets and authors were disproportionately overrepresented in clinical AI, and almost all of the top 10 databases and author nationalities were from high income countries (HICs). AI techniques were most commonly employed for image-rich specialties, and authors were predominantly male, with non-clinical backgrounds. Development of technological infrastructure in data-poor regions, and diligence in external validation and model re-calibration prior to clinical implementation in the short-term, are crucial in ensuring clinical AI is meaningful for broader populations, and to avoid perpetuating global health inequity.",

    "abstract": "The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to clinical settings for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and the improvement of clinical care have been demonstrably cost-effective. However, current clinical AI (cAI) support tools are predominantly created by non-domain experts and algorithms available in the market have been criticized for the lack of transparency behind their creation. To combat these challenges, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Critical Data (MIT-CD) consortium, an affiliation of research labs, organizations, and individuals that contribute to research in and around data that has a critical impact on human health, has iteratively developed the \"Ecosystem as a Service (EaaS)\" approach, providing a transparent education and accountability platform for clinical and technical experts to collaborate and advance cAI. The EaaS approach provides a range of resources, from open-source databases and specialized human resources to networking and collaborative opportunities. While mass deployment of the ecosystem still faces several hurdles, here we discuss our initial implementation efforts. We hope this will promote further exploration and expansion of the EaaS approach, while also informing or realizing policies that will accelerate multinational, multidisciplinary, and multisectoral collaborations in cAI research and development, and provide localized clinical best practices for equitable healthcare access.",

    "abstract": "The recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic displayed weaknesses in the healthcare infrastructures worldwide and exposed a lack of specialized personnel to cover the demands of a massive calamity. We have developed a portable ventilator that uses real-time vitals read from the patient to estimate -- through artificial intelligence -- the optimal operation point. The ventilator has redundant telecommunication capabilities; therefore, the remote assistance model can protect specialists and relatives from highly contagious agents. Additionally, we have designed a system that automatically publishes information in a proprietary cloud centralizer to keep physicians and relatives informed. The system was tested in a residential last-mile connection, and transaction times below the second were registered. The timing scheme allows us to operate up to 200 devices concurrently on these lowest-specification transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) services, promptly transmitting data for online processing and reporting. The ventilator is a proof of concept of automation that has behavioral and cognitive inputs to cheaply, yet reliably, extend the installed capacity of the healthcare systems and multiply the response of the skilled medical personnel to cover high-demanding scenarios and improve service quality.",

    "abstract": "This topical review is focused on the clinical breast x-ray imaging applications of the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI). The range of AI applications is broad. AI can be used for breast cancer risk estimation that could allow for tailoring the screening interval and the protocol that are woman-specific and for triaging the screening exams. It also can serve as a tool to aid in the detection and diagnosis for improved sensitivity and specificity and as a tool to reduce radiologists' reading time. AI can also serve as a potential second 'reader' during screening interpretation. During the last decade, numerous studies have shown the potential of AI-assisted interpretation of mammography and to a lesser extent digital breast tomosynthesis; however, most of these studies are retrospective in nature. There is a need for prospective clinical studies to evaluate these technologies to better understand their real-world efficacy. Further, there are ethical, medicolegal, and liability concerns that need to be considered prior to the routine use of AI in the breast imaging clinic.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory clinical decision support (CDS) typically relies on data from the electronic health record (EHR). The implementation of a sustainable, effective laboratory CDS program requires a commitment to standardization and harmonization of key EHR data elements that are the foundation of laboratory CDS. The direct use of artificial intelligence algorithms in CDS programs will be limited unless key elements of the EHR are structured. The identification, curation, maintenance, and preprocessing steps necessary to implement robust laboratory-based algorithms must account for the heterogeneity of data present in a typical EHR.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods are being increasingly investigated as a means to generate predictive models applicable in the clinical practice. In this study, we developed a model to predict the efficacy of immunotherapy (IO) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using eXplainable AI (XAI) Machine Learning (ML) methods.\nWe prospectively collected real-world data from patients with an advanced NSCLC condition receiving immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. With regards to six different outcomes - Disease Control Rate (DCR), Objective Response Rate (ORR), 6 and 24-month Overall Survival (OS6 and OS24), 3-months Progression-Free Survival (PFS3) and Time to Treatment Failure (TTF3) - we evaluated five different classification ML models: CatBoost (CB), Logistic Regression (LR), Neural Network (NN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We used the Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values to explain model predictions.\nOf 480 patients included in the study 407 received immunotherapy and 73 chemo- and immunotherapy. From all the ML models, CB performed the best for OS6 and TTF3, (accuracy 0.83 and 0.81, respectively). CB and LR reached accuracy of 0.75 and 0.73 for the outcome DCR. SHAP for CB demonstrated that the feature that strongly influences models' prediction for all three outcomes was Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR). Performance Status (ECOG-PS) was an important feature for the outcomes OS6 and TTF3, while PD-L1, Line of IO and chemo-immunotherapy appeared to be more important in predicting DCR.\nIn this study we developed a ML algorithm based on real-world data, explained by SHAP techniques, and able to accurately predict the efficacy of immunotherapy in sets of NSCLC patients.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) includes two major skills: managing oneself and successful cooperation with others. Healthcare workers are exposed to numerous work stressors, such as limited resources, organizational challenges, complex diseases, etc. EI can help healthcare workers to better cope with the demands of their work. This study aimed to analyze whether there is an association between emotional intelligence and the degree of education of healthcare professionals working in emergency medicine.\nThe study was conducted among healthcare personnel employed in in-hospital and out-of-hospital emergency departments in Croatia. EI was measured using the Emotional Skills & Competence Questionnaire (ESCQ-45).\nOf the 137 eligible participants, 97 (71%) accepted to participate. Emotional intelligence was not significantly associated with the respondents' education. Healthcare personnel employed in the in-hospital emergency department and women had higher emotional competence than workers from out-of-hospital emergency departments and men. There was no significant association between EI and the age of respondents.\nEI of employed adults is an individual characteristic that does not depend on the educational level or degree. It would be worthwhile to explore further whether there are significant differences between the EI of healthcare workers in various settings within the health system and invest resources in increasing EI in settings with a lower EI.",

    "abstract": "One of the major challenges in the quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) from stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the estimation of the arterial input function (AIF). This is due to the non-linear relationship between the concentration of gadolinium and the MR signal, which leads to signal saturation. In this work, we show that a deep learning model can be trained to predict the unsaturated AIF from standard images, using the reference dual-sequence acquisition AIFs (DS-AIFs) for training.\nA 1D U-Net was trained, to take the saturated AIF from the standard images as input and predict the unsaturated AIF, using the data from 201 patients from centre 1 and a test set comprised of both an independent cohort of consecutive patients from centre 1 and an external cohort of patients from centre 2 (\nQuantification of stress perfusion CMR is feasible with a single-sequence acquisition and a single contrast injection using an AI-based correction of the AIF.",

    "abstract": "When studying science contexts, scholars typically position charismatic authority as an adjunct or something that provides a meaning-laden boost to rational authority. In this paper, we re-theorize these relationships. We re-center charismatic authority as an interpretive resource that allows scientists and onlookers to recast a professional conflict in terms of a public drama. In this mode, both professionals and lay enthusiasts portray involvement in the scientific process as a story of suppression and persecution, in which only a few remarkable figures can withstand scrutiny and take on challengers with dignity. Description and elaboration of these figures and the folklore surrounding them sets in motion the interpretive processes by which some actors become charismatic leaders and others charismatic followers within science, ultimately providing alternative symbolic resources for an embattled research agenda to accrue legitimacy. To illustrate, we use the case of Arthur Jensen - a deceased intelligence researcher and the intellectual father to contemporary texts like The Bell Curve - and the circles of hero worship that admirers inside and outside academia have created to praise him. Using this perspective to study Jensen and his admirers demonstrates how the perennial race and intelligence debates gain a kind of symbolic power, unrelated to their scientific merit or racist appeal, which enables such debates to thrive and persist in the public sphere. More generally, our approach identifies contemporary processes by which scientific ideas can gain public authority even when their intellectual merit has been deemed dubious.",

    "abstract": "Neurolinguistic programming (NLP) is a method of personal communication. This study aimed to determine the effect of NLP strategies on academic achievement, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking. Although NLP has been studied, more studies still need to be conducted on this variable contributing to language learning success. This experimental study was conducted with a pretest-posttest design with the control group in 2021. Sampling was conducted through the multistage cluster random sampling (MCRS) method, and based on the Cambridge placement test (2010), 50 students proved to be at an advanced level and participated in this study. To test the hypotheses, an ANCOVA test was employed. Participants were randomly divided into two control (25 people) and experimental groups (25 people). They were performed on the experimental group during 12 sessions of 90 min of the strategic training in NLP. In the experimental group, the mean and std of critical thinking was 16.24 \u00b1 2.59 in the pretest, which increased to 18.88 \u00b1 2.77 in the posttest; the mean and std of academic achievement was 155.02 \u00b1 15.90 in the pretest, which rose to 171.70 \u00b1 10.83 in the posttest and the mean and std of emotional intelligence was 96.51 \u00b1 12.44 in the pretest, which increased to 118.28 \u00b1 6.18 in the posttest. The results of data analysis by covariance method showed that NLP was practical on learners' academic achievement, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking. Justifications and implications for the study's findings and suggestions for further research are presented.",

After AIBUS scanning, the weighted Kappa value for BI-RADS categorization between videos watched by senior radiologists and HHUS was 0.497 (\nAIBUS breast scan can obtain relatively clear images and detect more breast nodules. The results of AIBUS scanning watched by senior radiologists are moderately consistent with HHUS and might be used in screening practice, especially in primary health care with limited numbers of radiologists.",

    "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotransmitter modulator, plays a significant role in neuronal survival and growth and participates in neuronal plasticity, thus being essential for learning, memory, and the development of cognition. Additionally, it is crucial for appetite, weight, and metabolic control and plays a pivotal role in the cardiovascular system. The Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265) of the BDNF gene causes a decrease in BDNF secretion and plays a role in impairments in cognition, energy homeostasis, and cardiovascular events. The present study aimed to evaluate the association of polymorphism (rs6265) of the BDNF gene with three quantitative traits simultaneously, namely, intelligence quotient (IQ), body mass index (BMI), and blood pressure (BP).\nPsychometric, morphometric, and physiometric data of the total participants (\nThe allelic frequencies of alleles C and T were 72 and 28%, respectively. Under the dominant genetic model, a significant susceptible association of minor allele T was observed with a lower average verbal comprehensive index (OR = 2.216, \nThis novel study may improve our understanding of genetic alterations to the traits and hence be helpful for clinicians and researchers to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of this neurotrophic factor.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the most common cause of death globally. Increasing amounts of highly diverse ASCVD data are becoming available and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques now bear the promise of utilizing them to improve diagnosis, advance understanding of disease pathogenesis, enable outcome prediction, assist with clinical decision making and promote precision medicine approaches. Machine learning (ML) algorithms in particular, are already employed in cardiovascular imaging applications to facilitate automated disease detection and experts believe that ML will transform the field in the coming years. Current review first describes the key concepts of AI applications from a clinical standpoint. We then provide a focused overview of current AI applications in four main ASCVD domains: coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and carotid artery disease. For each domain, applications are presented with refer to the primary imaging modality used [e.g., computed tomography (CT) or invasive angiography] and the key aim of the applied AI approaches, which include disease detection, phenotyping, outcome prediction, and assistance with clinical decision making. We conclude with the strengths and limitations of AI applications and provide future perspectives.",

Of these, 9,219 radiographs were randomly selected to train and verify the system. The remaining 1,000 radiographs were used to compare the system's and the clinicians' measurement results. All plain pelvic films were labeled by an expert committee through PACS system based on a uniform standard to measure acetabular index. Subsequently, eight other clinicians independently measured the acetabular index from 200 randomly selected radiographs from the test radiographs. Bland-Altman test was used for consistency analysis between the system and clinician measurements.\nThe test set included 1,000 cases (2,000 hips). Compared with the expert committee measurement, the 95% limits of agreement (95% LOA) of the system was -4.02\u00b0 to 3.45\u00b0 (bias\u2009=\u2009-0.27\u00b0, \nThe newly constructed artificial intelligence system could quickly and accurately measure the acetabular index of standard anteroposterior pelvic radiographs. There is good data consistency between the system in measuring standard anteroposterior pelvic radiographs. The accuracy of the system is closer to that of senior clinicians.",

    "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, together with the availability of big data in society, creates uncertainties about how these developments will affect healthcare systems worldwide. Compassion is essential for high-quality healthcare and research shows how prosocial caring behaviors benefit human health and societies. However, the possible association between AI technologies and compassion is under conceptualized and underexplored.\nThe aim of this scoping review is to provide a comprehensive depth and a balanced perspective of the emerging topic of AI technologies and compassion, to inform future research and practice. The review questions were: How is compassion discussed in relation to AI technologies in healthcare? How are AI technologies being used to enhance compassion in healthcare? What are the gaps in current knowledge and unexplored potential? What are the key areas where AI technologies could support compassion in healthcare?\nA systematic scoping review following five steps of Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Presentation of the scoping review conforms with PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). Eligibility criteria were defined according to 3 concept constructs (AI technologies, compassion, healthcare) developed from the literature and informed by medical subject headings (MeSH) and key words for the electronic searches. Sources of evidence were Web of Science and PubMed databases, articles published in English language 2011-2022. Articles were screened by title/abstract using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data extracted (author, date of publication, type of article, aim/context of healthcare, key relevant findings, country) was charted using data tables. Thematic analysis used an inductive-deductive approach to generate code categories from the review questions and the data. A multidisciplinary team assessed themes for resonance and relevance to research and practice.\nSearches identified 3,124 articles. A total of 197 were included after screening. The number of articles has increased over 10 years (2011, \nThere is an association between AI technologies and compassion in healthcare and interest in this association has grown internationally over the last decade. In a range of healthcare contexts, AI technologies are being used to enhance empathetic awareness; empathetic response and relational behavior; communication skills; health coaching; therapeutic interventions; moral development learning; clinical knowledge and clinical assessment; healthcare quality assessment; therapeutic bond and therapeutic alliance; and to provide health information and advice. The findings inform a reconceptualization of compassion as a \nIn a complex adaptive system such as healthcare, human-AI intelligent caring will need to be implemented, not as an ideology, but through strategic choices, incentives, regulation, professional education, and training, as well as through joined up thinking about human-AI intelligent caring. Research funders can encourage research and development into the topic of AI technologies and compassion as a system of human-AI intelligent caring. Educators, technologists, and health professionals can inform themselves about the system of human-AI intelligent caring.",

    "abstract": "The expanded use of clinical tools that incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) methods has generated calls for specific competencies for effective and ethical use. This qualitative study used expert interviews to define AI-related clinical competencies for health care professionals.\nIn 2021, a multidisciplinary team interviewed 15 experts in the use of AI-based tools in health care settings about the clinical competencies health care professionals need to work effectively with such tools. Transcripts of the semistructured interviews were coded and thematically analyzed. Draft competency statements were developed and provided to the experts for feedback. The competencies were finalized using a consensus process across the research team.\nSix competency domain statements and 25 subcompetencies were formulated from the thematic analysis. The competency domain statements are: (1) basic knowledge of AI: explain what AI is and describe its health care applications; (2) social and ethical implications of AI: explain how social, economic, and political systems influence AI-based tools and how these relationships impact justice, equity, and ethics; (3) AI-enhanced clinical encounters: carry out AI-enhanced clinical encounters that integrate diverse sources of information in creating patient-centered care plans; (4) evidence-based evaluation of AI-based tools: evaluate the quality, accuracy, safety, contextual appropriateness, and biases of AI-based tools and their underlying data sets in providing care to patients and populations; (5) workflow analysis for AI-based tools: analyze and adapt to changes in teams, roles, responsibilities, and workflows resulting from implementation of AI-based tools; and (6) practice-based learning and improvement regarding AI-based tools: participate in continuing professional development and practice-based improvement activities related to use of AI tools in health care.\nThe 6 clinical competencies identified can be used to guide future teaching and learning programs to maximize the potential benefits of AI-based tools and diminish potential harms.",

    "abstract": "Technological breakthroughs, together with the rapid growth of medical information and improved data connectivity, are creating dramatic shifts in the health care landscape, including the field of developmental and behavioral pediatrics. While medical information took an estimated 50 years to double in 1950, by 2020, it was projected to double every 73 days. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered health technologies, once considered theoretical or research-exclusive concepts, are increasingly being granted regulatory approval and integrated into clinical care. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has cleared or approved over 160 health-related AI-based devices to date. These trends are only likely to accelerate as economic investment in AI health care outstrips investment in other sectors. The exponential increase in peer-reviewed AI-focused health care publications year over year highlights the speed of growth in this sector. As health care moves toward an era of intelligent technology powered by rich medical information, pediatricians will increasingly be asked to engage with tools and systems underpinned by AI. However, medical students and practicing clinicians receive insufficient training and lack preparedness for transitioning into a more AI-informed future. This article provides a brief primer on AI in health care. Underlying AI principles and key performance metrics are described, and the clinical potential of AI-driven technology together with potential pitfalls is explored within the developmental and behavioral pediatric health context.",

    "abstract": "The offline artificial intelligence (AI) on a smartphone-based fundus camera shows good agreement and correlation with the vertical cup-to-disc ratio (vCDR) from the spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and manual grading by experts.\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the agreement of vCDR measured by a new AI software from optic disc images obtained using a validated smartphone-based imaging device, with SD-OCT vCDR measurements, and manual grading by experts on a stereoscopic fundus camera.\nIn a prospective, cross-sectional study, participants above 18 years (Glaucoma and normal) underwent a dilated fundus evaluation, followed by optic disc imaging including a 42-degree monoscopic disc-centered image (Remidio NM-FOP-10), a 30-degree stereoscopic disc-centered image (Kowa nonmyd WX-3D desktop fundus camera), and disc analysis (Cirrus SD-OCT). Remidio FOP images were analyzed for vCDR using the new AI software, and Kowa stereoscopic images were manually graded by 3 fellowship-trained glaucoma specialists.\nWe included 473 eyes of 244 participants. The vCDR values from the new AI software showed strong agreement with SD-OCT measurements [95% limits of agreement (LoA)=-0.13 to 0.16]. The agreement with SD-OCT was marginally better in eyes with higher vCDR (95% LoA=-0.15 to 0.12 for vCDR>0.8). Interclass correlation coefficient was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.88-0.91). The vCDR values from AI software showed a good correlation with the manual segmentation by experts (interclass correlation coefficient=0.89, 95% CI, 0.87-0.91) on stereoscopic images (95% LoA=-0.18 to 0.11) with agreement better for eyes with vCDR>0.8 (LoA=-0.12 to 0.08).\nThe new AI software vCDR measurements had an excellent agreement and correlation with the SD-OCT and manual grading. The ability of the Medios AI to work offline, without requiring cloud-based inferencing, is an added advantage.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) for the detection of pneumothorax shows excellent sensitivity in the hands of skilled providers. Artificial intelligence may facilitate the movement of US for pneumothorax into the prehospital setting. The large amount of training data required for conventional neural network methodologies has limited their use in US so far.\nA limited training database was supplied by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of 30 patients, 15 cases with pneumothorax and 15 cases without. There were two US videos per patient, of which we were allowed to choose one to train on, so that a limited set of 30 videos were used. Images were annotated for ribs and pleural interface. The software performed anatomic reconstruction to identify the region of interest bounding the pleura. Three neural networks were created to analyze images on a pixel-by-pixel fashion with direct voting determining the outcome. Independent verification and validation was performed on a data set gathered by the Department of Defense.\nAnatomic reconstruction with the identification of ribs and pleura was able to be accomplished on all images. On independent verification and validation against the Department of Defense testing data, our program concurred with the SME 80% of the time and achieved a 86% sensitivity (18/21) for pneumothorax and a 75% specificity for the absence of pneumothorax (18/24). Some of the mistakes by our artificial intelligence can be explained by chest wall motion, hepatization of the underlying lung, or being equivocal cases.\nUsing learning with limited labeling techniques, pneumothorax was identified on US with an accuracy of 80%. Several potential improvements are controlling for chest wall motion and the use of longer videos.\nDiagnostic Tests; Level III.",

    "abstract": "To summarize the recent literature on deep learning (DL) model applications in glaucoma detection and surveillance using posterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging.\nDL models use OCT derived parameters including retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) scans, macular scans, and optic nerve head (ONH) scans, as well as a combination of these parameters, to achieve high diagnostic accuracy in detecting glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON). Although RNFL segmentation is the most widely used OCT parameter for glaucoma detection by ophthalmologists, newer DL models most commonly use a combination of parameters, which provide a more comprehensive approach. Compared to DL models for diagnosing glaucoma, DL models predicting glaucoma progression are less commonly studied but have also been developed.\nDL models offer time-efficient, objective, and potential options in the management of glaucoma. Although artificial intelligence models have already been commercially accepted as diagnostic tools for other ophthalmic diseases, there is no commercially approved DL tool for the diagnosis of glaucoma, most likely in part due to the lack of a universal definition of glaucoma defined by OCT derived parameters alone (see Supplemental Digital Content 1 for video abstract, http://links.lww.com/COOP/A54 ).",

This review aims to highlight several recent developments in these models over the past year and their ophthalmic implications.\nArtificial intelligence models with a diverse range of applications in ophthalmology have been reported in the literature over the past year. Many of these systems have reported high performance in detection, classification, prognostication, and/or monitoring of retinal, glaucomatous, anterior segment, and other ocular pathologies.\nOver the past year, developments in AI have been made that have implications affecting ophthalmic surgical training and refractive outcomes after cataract surgery, therapeutic monitoring of disease, disease classification, and prognostication. Many of these recently developed models have obtained encouraging results and have the potential to serve as powerful clinical decision-making tools pending further external validation and evaluation of their generalizability.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) was originally conceived as an ability, followed soon after by mixed, competency and trait theoretical models, broadly described as emotional efficacies (EE). Several models have attempted to integrate both approaches, with different views on whether EI and EE operate in sequence or parallel. One reason for this may be that EE constructs are given the same ontological status whether they represent underlying attitudes, such as self-regard, or behavioral competencies, such as assertiveness. In this paper, it is proposed that attitudes may predominantly act as underlying antecedents of ability-EI and behavioral-EE. Five benefits of this approach are drawn out that help to address some key concerns with current models and measures of EI and EE. First, the inclusion of implicit and explicit attitudes within integrated models of EI/EE would support the dual-processing of conscious and automated processes. From this, an attitude-based dual-processing framework for EI/EE is recommended. Second, the concept of Unconditional Positive Regard (UPR) for self and others, is identified as a potential attitude that may underpin the two core pillars of intrapersonal and interpersonal EI/EE. Third, UPR attitudes would provide an ethical basis for EI/EE that may support ethical and prosocial behavior. Fourth, UPR attitudes may differentiate between the optimal and sub-optimal elements of EI/EE. Fifth, an attitude-based approach to EI/EE may be more aligned with EI/EE being developmental than are the more static ability or trait-based models of EI/EE.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers potential opportunities to optimize clinical pharmacy services in community or hospital settings. The objective of this systematic literature review was to identify and analyse quantitative studies using or integrating AI for clinical pharmacy services.\nA systematic review was conducted using PubMed/Medline and Web of Science databases, including all articles published from 2000 to December 2021. Included studies had to involve pharmacists in the development or use of AI-powered apps and tools..\n19 studies using AI for clinical pharmacy services were included in this review. 12 out of 19 articles (63.1%) were published in 2020 or 2021. Various methodologies of AI were used, mainly machine learning techniques and subsets (natural language processing and deep learning). The datasets used to train the models were mainly extracted from electronic medical records (6 studies, 32%). Among clinical pharmacy services, medication order review was the service most targeted by AI-powered apps and tools (9 studies), followed by health product dispensing (4 studies), pharmaceutical interviews and therapeutic education (2 studies). The development of these tools mainly involved hospital pharmacists (12/19 studies).\nThe development of AI-powered apps and tools for clinical pharmacy services is just beginning. Pharmacists need to keep abreast of these developments in order to position themselves optimally while maintaining their human relationships with healthcare teams and patients. Significant efforts have to be made, in collaboration with data scientists, to better assess whether AI-powered apps and tools bring value to clinical pharmacy services in real practice.",

    "abstract": "We previously demonstrated that the White-Menelaus arithmetic formula combined with skeletal age as estimated with the Greulich and Pyle (GP) atlas was the most accurate method for predicting leg lengths and residual leg-length discrepancy (LLD) at maturity in a cohort of patients treated with epiphysiodesis. We sought to determine if an online artificial intelligence (AI)-based hand-and-wrist skeletal age system provided consistent readings and to evaluate how these readings influenced the prediction of the outcome of epiphysiodesis in this cohort.\nJPEG images of perioperative hand radiographs for 76 subjects were independently submitted by 2 authors to an AI skeletal age web site (http://physis.16bit.ai/). We compared the accuracy of the predicted long-leg length (after epiphysiodesis), short-leg length, and residual LLD with use of the White-Menelaus formula and either human-estimated GP or AI-estimated skeletal age.\nThe AI skeletal age readings had an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.99. AI-estimated skeletal age was generally greater than human-estimated GP skeletal age (average, 0.5 year greater in boys and 0.1 year greater in girls). Overall, the prediction accuracy was improved with AI readings; these differences reached significance for the short-leg and residual LLD prediction errors. Residual LLD was underestimated by \u22651.0 cm in 26 of 76 subjects when human-estimated GP skeletal age was used (range of underestimation, 1.0 to 3.2 cm), compared with only 10 of 76 subjects when AI skeletal age was used (range of underestimation, 1.1 cm to 2.2 cm) (p < 0.01). Residual LLD was overestimated by \u22651.0 cm in 3 of 76 subjects by both methods (range of overestimation, 1.0 to 1.3 cm for the human-estimated GP method and 1.0 to 1.6 cm for the AI method).\nThe AI method of determining hand-and-wrist skeletal age was highly reproducible in this cohort and improved the accuracy of prediction of leg length and residual discrepancy when compared with traditional human interpretation of the GP atlas. This improvement could be explained by more accurate estimation of skeletal age via a machine-learning AI system calibrated with a large database.\nPrognostic Level III.

    "abstract": "The aim: Organization of research work to substantiate and verify the potential development of emotional intelligence (EI) among student youth as a factor in preserving their mental health (MH) and adapting to crisis situations, in particular, those caused by military actions in Ukraine.\nMaterials and methods: The experimental base was 54 student-teachers of Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University (Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine). They were divided into a control group (34 people) and an experimental group (20 people), who participated in training according to the author's program. The questionnaire \"Self-assessment of adaptability and well-being in crisis conditions of martial law\" became the main prognostic tool of the research work. It was developed on the basis of D. Lusin's EI measurement technique, the MSCEIT test; the method of differential diagnosis of depressive states by V. Zung.\nResults: The research work consisted of two parts: theoretical (definition of terminology, conceptual concepts, hypotheses of research work; development of a structural model of EI) and experimental, which was implemented in three stages: ascertainment (determination of the initial level of EI of the participants of the experiment), formative (organization of training according to the author's experimental program), control (determination of changes in the level of proficiency of EI students). The positive influence of the author's program on the increase in the indicators of EG members' possession by four components of EI (informational; adaptive behavior; self-control; empathy) at three levels is substantiated: high - an increase from 12.25% to 25%; average decrease from 43.75 to 47%; low - a decrease from 44% to 28.75%. The common, special, excellent results of our research work and experimental studies of other authors are shown.\nConclusions: The conducted study generally confirmed the hypothesis that thanks to the training of EI (in particular, its four components: informational; adaptive behavior; self-control; empathy) can become an effective factor in preserving a person's MH and adapting to crisis situations. The prognostic toolkit presented in the work, the procedure for formalizing the results of the experiment, and the methodology of the author's training program for the formation of EI are extremely representative, understandable, and valid. Since the research is based on materials that are publicly available on the Internet, its results can be used and developed by either scientists or medical and social workers, practicing teaching. All life crises, including those caused by military events, mass casualties and large-scale destruction, get to the end sooner or later. Therefore, their experience should be carefully studied in order to effectively use the potential of EI in increasing human life resources.",

Since the research is based on materials that are publicly available on the Internet, its results can be used and developed by either scientists or medical and social workers, practicing teaching. All life crises, including those caused by military events, mass casualties and large-scale destruction, get to the end sooner or later. Therefore, their experience should be carefully studied in order to effectively use the potential of EI in increasing human life resources.",

The positive influence of the author's program on the increase in the indicators of EG members' possession by four components of EI (informational; adaptive behavior; self-control; empathy) at three levels is substantiated: high - an increase from 12.25% to 25%; average decrease from 43.75 to 47%; low - a decrease from 44% to 28.75%. The common, special, excellent results of our research work and experimental studies of other authors are shown.",

    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after a surgery, especially in cardiac and aortic procedures, and has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Early identification of high-risk patients and providing effective prevention and therapeutic approach are the main strategies for reducing the possibility of perioperative AKI. Consequently, several risk-prediction models and risk assessment scores have been developed for the prediction of perioperative AKI. However, a majority of these risk scores are only derived from preoperative data while the intraoperative time-series monitoring data such as heart rate and blood pressure were not included. Moreover, the complexity of the pathophysiology of AKI, as well as its nonlinear and heterogeneous nature, imposes limitations on the use of linear statistical techniques. The development of clinical medicine's digitization, the widespread availability of electronic medical records, and the increase in the use of continuous monitoring have generated vast quantities of data. Machine learning has recently shown promise as a method for automatically integrating large amounts of data in predicting the risk of perioperative outcomes. In this article, we discussed the development, limitations of existing work, and the potential future direction of models using machine learning techniques to predict AKI after a surgery.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in many fields of clinical care to assist health care providers in patient management. In adult-focused nephrology, artificial intelligence is beginning to be used to improve clinical care, hemodialysis prescriptions, and follow-up of transplant recipients. This article provides an overview of medical artificial intelligence applications relevant to pediatric nephrology. We describe the core concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning and cover the basics of neural networks and deep learning. We also discuss some examples for clinical applications of artificial intelligence in pediatric nephrology, including neonatal kidney function, early recognition of acute kidney injury, renally cleared drug dosing, intrapatient variability, urinary tract infection workup in infancy, and longitudinal disease progression. Furthermore, we consider the future of artificial intelligence in clinical pediatric nephrology and its potential impact on medical practice and address the ethical issues artificial intelligence raises in terms of clinical decision-making, health care provider-patient relationship, patient privacy, and data collection. This article also represents a call for action involving those of us striving to provide optimal services for children, adolescents, and young adults with chronic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) applications into clinical practice requires AI-savvy radiologists to ensure the safe, ethical, and effective use of these systems for patient care. Increasing demand for AI education reflects recognition of the translation of AI applications from research to clinical practice, with positive trainee attitudes regarding the influence of AI on radiology. However, barriers to AI education, such as limited access to resources, predispose to insufficient preparation for the effective use of AI in practice. In response, national organizations have sponsored formal and self-directed learning courses to provide introductory content on imaging informatics and AI. Foundational courses, such as the National Imaging Informatics Course - Radiology and the Radiological Society of North America Imaging AI Certificate, lay a framework for trainees to explore the creation, deployment, and critical evaluation of AI applications. This report includes additional resources for formal programming courses, video series from leading organizations, and blogs from AI and informatics communities. Furthermore, the scope of \"AI and radiology education\" includes AI-augmented radiology education, with emphasis on the potential for \"precision education\" that creates personalized experiences for trainees by accounting for varying learning styles and inconsistent, possibly deficient, clinical case volume. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 ",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) plays an important role in modern society. AI applications are omnipresent and assist many decisions we make in daily life. A common and important feature of such AI applications are user models. These models allow an AI application to adapt to a specific user. Here, we argue that user models in AI can be optimized by modeling these user models more closely to models of human cognition. We identify three levels at which insights from human cognition can be-and have been-integrated in user models. Such integration can be very loose with user models only being inspired by general knowledge of human cognition or very tight with user models implementing specific cognitive processes. Using AI-based applications in the context of education as a case study, we demonstrate that user models that are more deeply rooted in models of cognition offer more valid and more fine-grained adaptations to an individual user. We propose that such user models can also advance the development of explainable AI.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing interest of academics in the application of artificial intelligence to sepsis, thousands of papers on this field had been published in the past few decades. It is difficult for researchers to understand the themes and latest research frontiers in this field from a multi-dimensional perspective. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to analyze the relevant literature in the application of artificial intelligence to sepsis through bibliometrics software, so as to better understand the development status, study the core hotspots and future development trends of this field.\nWe collected relevant publications in the application of artificial intelligence to sepsis from the Web of Science Core Collection in 2000 to 2021. The type of publication was limited to articles and reviews, and language was limited to English. Research cooperation network, journals, cited references, keywords in this field were visually analyzed by using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and COOC software.\nA total of 8,481 publications in the application of artificial intelligence to sepsis between 2000 and 2021 were included, involving 8,132 articles and 349 reviews. Over the past 22 years, the annual number of publications had gradually increased exponentially. The USA was the most productive country, followed by China. Harvard University, Schuetz, Philipp, and \nThis study conducted a comprehensive and objective analysis of the publications on the application of artificial intelligence in sepsis. It can be predicted that precise treatment of sepsis through machine learning technology is still research hotspot in this field.",

    "abstract": "We sought to evaluate the reliability and diagnostic accuracy of a novel handheld ultrasound device (HUD) with artificial intelligence (AI) assisted algorithm to automatically calculate ejection fraction (autoEF) in a real-world patient population.\nWe studied 100 consecutive patients (57\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u2009years old, 61% male), including 38 with abnormal left ventricular (LV) function [LV ejection fraction (LVEF)\u2009<\u200950%]. The autoEF results acquired using the HUD were independently compared with manually traced biplane Simpson's rule measurements on cart-based systems to assess method agreement using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), linear regression analysis, and Bland-Altman analysis. The diagnostic accuracy for the detection of LVEF <50% was also calculated. Test-retest reliability of measured EF by the HUD was assessed by calculating the ICC and the minimal detectable change (MDC). The ICC, linear regression analysis, and Bland-Altman analysis revealed good agreement between autoEF and reference manual EF (ICC\u2009=\u20090.85; \nUse of a novel HUD with AI-enabled capabilities provided similar LVEF results with those derived by manual biplane Simpson's method on cart-based systems and shows clinical potential.",

    "abstract": "Emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have compromised existing vaccines and posed a grand challenge to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention, control, and global economic recovery. For COVID-19 patients, one of the most effective COVID-19 medications is monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies. The United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) has given the emergency use authorization (EUA) to a few mAbs, including those from Regeneron, Eli Elly, etc. However, they are also undermined by SARS-CoV-2 mutations. It is imperative to develop effective mutation-proof mAbs for treating COVID-19 patients infected by all emerging variants and/or the original SARS-CoV-2. We carry out a deep mutational scanning to present the blueprint of such mAbs using algebraic topology and artificial intelligence (AI). To reduce the risk of clinical trial-related failure, we select five mAbs either with FDA EUA or in clinical trials as our starting point. We demonstrate that topological AI-designed mAbs are effective for variants of concerns and variants of interest designated by the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as the original SARS-CoV-2. Our topological AI methodologies have been validated by tens of thousands of deep mutational data and their predictions have been confirmed by results from tens of experimental laboratories and population-level statistics of genome isolates from hundreds of thousands of patients.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is a sub-field of artificial intelligence that uses computer algorithms to extract patterns from raw data, acquire knowledge without human input, and apply this knowledge for various tasks. Traditional statistical methods that classify or regress data have limited capacity to handle large datasets that have a low signal-to-noise ratio. In contrast to traditional models, ML relies on fewer assumptions, can handle larger and more complex datasets, and does not require predictors or interactions to be pre-specified, allowing for novel relationships to be detected. In this review, we discuss the rationale for the use and applications of ML in heart failure, including disease classification, early diagnosis, early detection of decompensation, risk stratification, optimal titration of medical therapy, effective patient selection for devices, and clinical trial recruitment. We discuss how ML can be used to expedite implementation and close healthcare gaps in learning healthcare systems. We review the limitations of ML, including opaque logic and unreliable model performance in the setting of data errors or data shift. Whilst ML has great potential to improve clinical care and research in HF, the applications must be externally validated in prospective studies for broad uptake to occur.",

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic computing mimics the organizational principles of the brain in its quest to replicate the brain's intellectual abilities. An impressive ability of the brain is its adaptive intelligence, which allows the brain to regulate its functions \"on the fly\" to cope with myriad and ever-changing situations. In particular, the brain displays three adaptive and advanced intelligence abilities of context-awareness, cross frequency coupling, and feature binding. To mimic these adaptive cognitive abilities, we design and simulate a novel, hardware-based adaptive oscillatory neuron using a lattice of magnetic skyrmions. Charge current fed to the neuron reconfigures the skyrmion lattice, thereby modulating the neuron's state, its dynamics and its transfer function \"on the fly.\" This adaptive neuron is used to demonstrate the three cognitive abilities, of which context-awareness and cross-frequency coupling have not been previously realized in hardware neurons. Additionally, the neuron is used to construct an adaptive artificial neural network (ANN) and perform context-aware diagnosis of breast cancer. Simulations show that the adaptive ANN diagnoses cancer with higher accuracy while learning faster and using a more compact and energy-efficient network than a nonadaptive ANN. The work further describes how hardware-based adaptive neurons can mitigate several critical challenges facing contemporary ANNs. Modern ANNs require large amounts of training data, energy, and chip area, and are highly task-specific; conversely, hardware-based ANNs built with adaptive neurons show faster learning, compact architectures, energy-efficiency, fault-tolerance, and can lead to the realization of broader artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness for people who have diabetes in the world. However, early detection of this disease can essentially decrease its effects on the patient. The recent breakthroughs in technologies, including the use of smart health systems based on Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain are trying to improve the early diagnosis and treatment of diabetic retinopathy. In this study, we presented an AI-based smart teleopthalmology application for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. The app has the ability to facilitate the analyses of eye fundus images via deep learning from the Kaggle database using Tensor Flow mathematical library. The app would be useful in promoting mHealth and timely treatment of diabetic retinopathy by clinicians. With the AI-based application presented in this paper, patients can easily get supports and physicians and researchers can also mine or predict data on diabetic retinopathy and reports generated could assist doctors to determine the level of severity of the disease among the people.",

    "abstract": "Accurately determining atrial arrhythmia mechanisms from a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) can be challenging. Given the high success rate of cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation, identification of CTI-dependent typical atrial flutter (AFL) is important for treatment decisions and procedure planning. We sought to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify CTI-dependent AFL vs. non-CTI dependent atrial tachycardia (AT), using data from the invasive electrophysiology (EP) study as the gold standard.\nWe trained a CNN on data from 231 patients undergoing EP studies for atrial tachyarrhythmia. A total of 13\u2009500 five-second 12-lead ECG segments were used for training. Each case was labelled CTI-dependent AFL or non-CTI-dependent AT based on the findings of the EP study. The model performance was evaluated against a test set of 57 patients. A survey of electrophysiologists in Europe was undertaken on the same 57 ECGs. The model had an accuracy of 86% (95% CI 0.77-0.95) compared to median expert electrophysiologist accuracy of 79% (range 70-84%). In the two thirds of test set cases (38/57) where both the model and electrophysiologist consensus were in agreement, the prediction accuracy was 100%. Saliency mapping demonstrated atrial activation was the most important segment of the ECG for determining model output.\nWe describe the first CNN trained to differentiate CTI-dependent AFL from other AT using the ECG. Our model matched and complemented expert electrophysiologist performance. Automated artificial intelligence-enhanced ECG analysis could help guide treatment decisions and plan ablation procedures for patients with organized atrial arrhythmias.",

    "abstract": "Patients with congestive heart failure (HF) are prone to clinical deterioration leading to hospital admissions, burdening both patients and the healthcare system. Predicting hospital admission in this patient group could enable timely intervention, with subsequent reduction of these admissions. To date, hospital admission prediction remains challenging. Increasing amounts of acquired data and development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology allow for the creation of reliable hospital prediction algorithms for HF patients. This scoping review describes the current literature on strategies and performance of AI-based algorithms for prediction of hospital admission in patients with HF.\nPubMed, EMBASE, and the Web of Science were used to search for articles using machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods to predict hospitalization in patients with HF. After eligibility screening, 23 articles were included. Sixteen articles predicted 30-day hospital (re-)admission resulting in an area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.61 to 0.79. Six studies predicted hospital admission over longer time periods ranging from 6 months to 3 years, with AUC's ranging from 0.65 to 0.78. One study prospectively evaluated performance of a disposable sensory patch at home after hospitalization which resulted in an AUC of 0.89 for unplanned hospital admission prediction.\nAI has the potential to enable prediction of hospital admission in HF patients. Improvement of data management, adding new data sources such as telemonitoring data and ML models and prospective and external validation of current models must be performed before clinical applicability is possible.",

An increased physiological age has been associated with a higher risk of cardiac mortality in the non-transplant population. We aimed to investigate the utility of this algorithm in patients who underwent heart transplantation (HTx).\nA total of 540 patients were studied. The average ECG ages within 1 year before and after HTx were used to represent pre- and post-HTx ECG ages. Major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was defined as any coronary revascularization, heart failure hospitalization, re-transplantation, and mortality. Recipient pre-transplant ECG age (mean 63 \u00b1 11 years) correlated significantly with recipient chronological age (mean 49 \u00b1 14 years, \nElectrocardiogram age-derived cardiac ageing after transplantation is associated with a higher risk of MACE.

    "abstract": "Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) carries an increased risk for overt heart failure and mortality, yet treatable to mitigate disease progression. An artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) model demonstrated promise in LVSD screening, but the performance dropped unexpectedly in external validation. We thus sought to train \nECGs taken within 14 days of an echocardiogram were obtained from four academic hospitals (three in the United States and one in Japan). Four AI models were trained to detect patients with ejection fraction (EF) <40% using ECGs from each of the four institutions. All the models were then evaluated on the held-out test data set from the same institution and data from the three external institutions. Subgroup analyses stratified by patient characteristics and common ECG abnormalities were performed. A total of 221 846 ECGs were identified from the 4 institutions. While the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH)-trained and Keio-trained models yielded similar accuracy on their internal test data [area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) 0.913 and 0.914, respectively], external validity was worse for the Keio-trained model (AUROC: 0.905-0.915 for BWH trained and 0.849-0.877 for Keio-trained model). Although ECG abnormalities including atrial fibrillation, left bundle branch block, and paced rhythm-reduced detection, the models performed robustly across patient characteristics and other ECG features.\nWhile using the same model architecture, different data sets produced models with different performances for detecting low-EF highlighting the importance of external validation and extensive stratification analysis.",

    "abstract": "One of the most studied topics nowadays, from psychology in general, and from sport psychology, is anxiety. In fact, research on anxiety has been approached from various theoretical perspectives ranging from psychoanalysis, behaviorism, or more recently, those theories that take into consideration the importance of affective, rational, and emotional processes. The aim of this study is to analyze the levels of anxiety and emotional intelligence, and their relationship. The sample is composed of 165 university physical education students with a mean age of 20.33\u2009years (SD\u2009=\u20093.44), (70.9% male and 27.9% female). We used the CSAI-2 questionnaire (to measure cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and self-confidence), and the TMMS-24 (to measure emotional intelligence). The main findings of this research highlighted the presence of significant correlations between emotional clarity and emotional regulation, self-confidence, cognitive anxiety, and somatic anxiety. Therefore, we conclude that sporting performance is influenced by various variables of different kinds, including emotions, and highlight the importance of the incorporation of the emotional component in the field of sport.",

    "abstract": "One of the main problems that affect patients in dialysis therapy who are on the waiting list to receive a kidney transplant is predicting their survival time if they do not receive a transplant. This paper proposes a new approach to survival prediction based on artificial intelligence techniques combined with statistical methods to study the association between sociodemographic factors and patient survival on the waiting list if they do not receive a kidney transplant. This new approach consists of a first stage that uses the clustering techniques that are best suited to the data structure (K-Means, Mini Batch K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering and K-Modes) used to identify the risk profile of dialysis patients. Later, a new method called False Clustering Discovery Reduction is performed to determine the minimum number of populations to be studied, and whose mortality risk is statistically differentiable. This approach was applied to the OPTN medical dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a044,663). The procedure started from 11 initial clusters obtained with the Agglomerative technique, and was reduced to eight final risk populations, for which their Kaplan-Meier survival curves were provided. With this result, it is possible to make predictions regarding the survival time of a new patient who enters the waiting list if the sociodemographic profile of the patient is known. To do so, the predictive algorithm XGBoost is used, which allows the cluster to which it belongs to be predicted and the corresponding Kaplan-Meier curve to be associated with it. This prediction process is achieved with an overall Multi-class AUC of 99.08\u00a0%.",

    "abstract": "Few objective measures are available for assessing the success of facial rejuvenation after face lift surgery. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) may be used for this type of measurement. The purpose of this investigation is to use artificial intelligence (AI) via CNNs to objectively classify patient photos by age before and after aesthetic surgery. Uniquely, men and patients undergoing deep plane face lifts were included.\nA CNN (FaceX) was used for facial age recognition and age estimation. Patient photos were analyzed preoperatively, and at three (PO1) and 12\u00a0months (PO2) postoperatively. The study population included male and female patients who underwent facial rejuvenation at our institution from 2017 to 2021. Patient photos were collected with the same camera, distance, and lighting.\n226 patients were analyzed with a mean true age of 62.2 (SD 6.7) years. The AI estimated the mean preoperative age to be 64.7 (SD 10.4) years. The AI was 96.0\u00a0% accurate. Across all subjects, a 3.5-year, 5\u00a0% reduction in age (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001) was attributed at PO1, and a 1.7\u00a0year, 3\u00a0% age reduction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034) at PO2. No single ancillary procedure or technique conferred more benefit than others. The 15 males had a 2.0\u00a0year, 4\u00a0% age reduction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.06) at PO1.\nAI can be used to objectively measure the success of facelift surgery and compare outcomes among rhytidectomy techniques. Additionally, multiple, different approaches were effective with no single approach being superior. As AI continues to rapidly advance, more accurate models may be developed for multiple applications in facial plastic surgery.",

Across all subjects, a 3.5-year, 5\u00a0% reduction in age (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001) was attributed at PO1, and a 1.7\u00a0year, 3\u00a0% age reduction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034) at PO2. No single ancillary procedure or technique conferred more benefit than others. The 15 males had a 2.0\u00a0year, 4\u00a0% age reduction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.06) at PO1.",

    "abstract": "In the coming years, artificial intelligence (AI) will pervade almost every aspect of the health care delivery system. AI has the potential to improve patient safety (e.g. diagnostic accuracy) as well as reduce the burden on clinicians (e.g. documentation-related workload); however, these benefits are yet to be realized. AI is only one element of a larger sociotechnical system that needs to be considered for effective AI application. In this paper, we describe the current challenges of integrating AI into clinical care and propose a sociotechnical systems (STS) approach for AI design and implementation. We demonstrate the importance of an STS approach through a case study on the design and implementation of a clinical decision support (CDS). In order for AI to reach its potential, the entire work system as well as clinical workflow must be systematically considered throughout the design of AI technology.",

    "abstract": "With the global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), public health has received unprecedented attention. The cultivation of emergency and compound professionals is the general trend through public health education. However, current public health education is limited to traditional teaching models that struggle to balance theory and practice. Fortunately, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) has entered the stage of intelligent cognition. The introduction of AI in education has opened a new era of computer-assisted education, which brought new possibilities for teaching and learning in public health education. AI-based on big data not only provides abundant resources for public health research and management but also brings convenience for students to obtain public health data and information, which is conducive to the construction of introductory professional courses for students. In this review, we elaborated on the current status and limitations of public health education, summarized the application of AI in public health practice, and further proposed a framework for how to integrate AI into public health education curriculum. With the rapid technological advancements, we believe that AI will revolutionize the education paradigm of public health and help respond to public health emergencies.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is steadily entering and transforming the health care and Primary Care (PC) domains. AI-based applications assist physicians in disease detection, medical advice, triage, clinical decision-making, diagnostics and digital public health. Recent literature has explored physicians' perspectives on the potential impact of digital public health on key tasks in PC. However, limited attention has been given to patients' perspectives of AI acceptance in PC, specifically during the coronavirus pandemic. Addressing this research gap, we administered a pilot study to investigate criteria for patients' readiness to use AI-based PC applications by analyzing key factors affecting the adoption of digital public health technology.\nThe pilot study utilized a two-phase mixed methods approach. First, we conducted a qualitative study with 18 semi-structured interviews. Second, based on the Technology Readiness and Acceptance Model (TRAM), we conducted an online survey (\nThe results indicate that respondents who scored high on innovativeness had a higher level of readiness to use AI-based technology in PC during the coronavirus pandemic. Surprisingly, patients' health awareness and sociodemographic factors, such as age, gender and education, were not significant predictors of AI-based technology acceptance in PC.\nThis paper makes two major contributions. First, we highlight key social and behavioral determinants of acceptance of AI-enabled health care and PC applications. Second, we propose that to increase the usability of digital public health tools and accelerate patients' AI adoption, in complex digital public health care ecosystems, we call for implementing adaptive, population-specific promotions of AI technologies and applications.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence is the ability to quickly and correctly recognize the emotional expressions of other people and to express and manage one's own emotions. It contributes to the success of a person in activities related to communication and interaction with people. Emotional intelligence has been studied largely in the context of organizational and education psychology, but less is known about the influence of genetics on it.\nWe aim to study emotional intelligence in carriers of different \u0421\u041e\u041c\u0422, BDNF, DRD2, and HTR2A genotypes.\nWe used three methods to measure emotional intelligence. Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test is a set of tasks with forced choice and frequency-based correct responses. We also applied two self-report questionnaires by Lyusin and Hall. We recruited 280 participants who took part in all three measures. We also identified their genotypes of the \u0421\u041e\u041c\u0422, BDNF, DRD2, and HTR2A genes.\nCarriers of the Val/Met genotype of the COMT gene, A/A genotype of the HTR2A gene and C/C genotype of the DRD2 gene showed the highest level of emotional intelligence, while no differences were found between carriers of the BDNF genotypes. These data were obtained by using the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. Self-report scores of emotional intelligence did not differ between carriers of different genotypes across all four of the genes in question.\nMayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test scores were differed for carriers of some genotypes, whereas self-reported emotional intelligence scores did not differ between according to genotype.",

    "abstract": "The present study was aimed at investigating the intelligence profiles and adaptive behaviors of children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HFASD) and developmental speech and language disorders (DSLDs). We compared the similarities and differences of cognitive capabilities and adaptive functions and explored their correlations in the HFASD and DSLDs groups.\n128 patients with HFASD, 111 patients with DSLDs and 114 typically developing (TD) children were enrolled into our study. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV) and Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II (ABAS-II) were respectively applied to evaluate intelligence profiles and adaptive behaviors. Intelligence quotient (IQ) scores and adaptive functioning scores among the HFASD, DSLDs and TD groups were compared through one-way ANOVA. Pearson correlation coefficient was applied to examine the relationships between WISC indices and ABAS domains.\nOutcomes showed significantly poorer intelligence profiles and adaptive behaviors in HFASD and DSLDs groups. Both children with HFASD and DSLDs demonstrated impairments in verbal comprehension and executive functions. Processing speed and working memory were the predominant defects of children with HFASD and DSLDs in the field of executive functions, respectively. Whereas perceptual reasoning was a relative strength for them. Children with DSLDs had balanced scores of all the domains in ABAS-II; nevertheless, HFASD individuals demonstrated striking impairments in Social domain. Correlation analysis showed IQs of children with HFASD were positively correlated with all the domains and General Adaptive Composite (GAC) of ABAS-II. Additionally, IQs were positively correlated with Conceptual domain and GAC for children with DSLDs. Compared with DSLDs group, intelligence displayed stronger correlations with adaptive behaviors in HFASD group.\nOur study expanded insights regarding intelligence profiles and adaptive behaviors of children with HFASD and DSLDs. Moreover, this study made breakthroughs in discovering positive correlations between IQs and adaptive functions in the two neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "The field of cancer neoantigen investigation has developed swiftly in the past decade. Predicting novel and true neoantigens derived from large multi-omics data became difficult but critical challenges. The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) in biomedicine application has brought benefits to strengthen the current computational pipeline for neoantigen prediction. ML algorithms offer powerful tools to recognize the multidimensional nature of the omics data and therefore extract the key neoantigen features enabling a successful discovery of new neoantigens. The present review aims to outline the significant technology progress of machine learning approaches, especially the newly deep learning tools and pipelines, that were recently applied in neoantigen prediction. In this review article, we summarize the current state-of-the-art tools developed to predict neoantigens. The standard workflow includes calling genetic variants in paired tumor and blood samples, and rating the binding affinity between mutated peptide, MHC (I and II) and T cell receptor (TCR), followed by characterizing the immunogenicity of tumor epitopes. More specifically, we highlight the outstanding feature extraction tools and multi-layer neural network architectures in typical ML models. It is noted that more integrated neoantigen-predicting pipelines are constructed with hybrid or combined ML algorithms instead of conventional machine learning models. In addition, the trends and challenges in further optimizing and integrating the existing pipelines are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Significant attempts have been made to improve the production of ion-selective membranes (ISMs) with higher efficiency and lower prices, while the traditional methods have drawbacks of limitations, high cost of experiments, and time-consuming computations. One of the best approaches to remove the experimental limitations is artificial intelligence (AI). This review discusses the role of AI in materials discovery and ISMs engineering. The AI can minimize the need for experimental tests by data analysis to accelerate computational methods based on models using the results of ISMs simulations. The coupling with computational chemistry makes it possible for the AI to consider atomic features in the output models since AI acts as a bridge between the experimental data and computational chemistry to develop models that can use experimental data and atomic properties. This hybrid method can be used in materials discovery of the membranes for ion extraction to investigate capabilities, challenges, and future perspectives of the AI-based materials discovery, which can pave the path for ISMs engineering.",

    "abstract": "High-performance fuel design is imperative to achieve cleaner burning and high-efficiency engine systems. We introduce a data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) framework to design liquid fuels exhibiting tailor-made properties for combustion engine applications to improve efficiency and lower carbon emissions. The fuel design approach is a constrained optimization task integrating two parts: (i) a deep learning (DL) model to predict the properties of pure components and mixtures and (ii) search algorithms to efficiently navigate in the chemical space. Our approach presents the mixture-hidden vector as a linear combination of each single component's vectors in each blend and incorporates it into the network architecture (the mixing operator (MO)). We demonstrate that the DL model exhibits similar accuracy as competing computational techniques in predicting the properties for pure components, while the search tool can generate multiple candidate fuel mixtures. The integrated framework was evaluated to showcase the design of high-octane and low-sooting tendency fuel that is subject to gasoline specification constraints. This AI fuel design methodology enables rapidly developing fuel formulations to optimize engine efficiency and lower emissions.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence has shown that patient drawings of pain can predict poor outcomes in headache surgery. Given that interpretation of pain drawings requires some clinical experience, the authors developed a machine learning framework capable of automatically interpreting pain drawings to predict surgical outcomes. This platform will allow surgeons with less clinical experience, neurologists, primary care practitioners, and even patients to better understand candidacy for headache surgery.\nA random forest machine learning algorithm was trained on 131 pain drawings provided prospectively by headache surgery patients before undergoing trigger-site deactivation surgery. Twenty-four features were used to describe the anatomical distribution of pain on each drawing for interpretation by the machine learning algorithm. Surgical outcome was measured by calculating percentage improvement in Migraine Headache Index at least 3 months after surgery. Artificial intelligence predictions were compared with clinician predictions of surgical outcome to determine artificial intelligence performance.\nEvaluation of the data test set demonstrated that the algorithm was consistently more accurate (94%) than trained clinical evaluators. Artificial intelligence weighted diffuse pain, facial pain, and pain at the vertex as strong predictors of poor surgical outcome.\nThis study indicates that structured algorithmic analysis is able to correlate pain patterns drawn by patients to Migraine Headache Index percentage improvement with good accuracy (94%). Further studies on larger data sets and inclusion of other significant clinical screening variables are required to improve outcome predictions in headache surgery and apply this tool to clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presented a unique opportunity for the World Health Organization (WHO) to utilise public health intelligence (PHI) for pandemic response. WHO systematically captured mainly unstructured information (e.g. media articles, listservs, community-based reporting) for public health intelligence purposes. WHO used the Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources (EIOS) system as one of the information sources for PHI. The processes and scope for PHI were adapted as the pandemic evolved and tailored to regional response needs. During the early months of the pandemic, media monitoring complemented official case and death reporting through the International Health Regulations mechanism and triggered alerts. As the pandemic evolved, PHI activities prioritised identifying epidemiological trends to supplement the information available through indicator-based surveillance reported to WHO. The PHI scope evolved over time to include vaccine introduction, emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, unusual clinical manifestations and upsurges in cases, hospitalisation and death incidences at subnational levels. Triaging the unprecedented high volume of information challenged surveillance activities but was managed by collaborative information sharing. The evolution of PHI activities using multiple sources in WHO's response to the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the future directions in which PHI methodologies could be developed and used.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of reporting of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare against Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-AI (CONSORT-AI) guidelines.\nSystematic review.\nWe searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for studies reported from January 2015 to December 2021.\nWe included RCTs reported in English that used AI as the intervention. Protocols, conference abstracts, studies on robotics and studies related to medical education were excluded.\nThe included studies were graded using the CONSORT-AI checklist, comprising 43 items, by two independent graders. The results were tabulated and descriptive statistics were reported.\nWe screened 1501 potential abstracts, of which 112 full-text articles were reviewed for eligibility. A total of 42 studies were included. The number of participants ranged from 22 to 2352. Only two items of the CONSORT-AI items were fully reported in all studies. Five items were not applicable in more than 85% of the studies. Nineteen per cent (8/42) of the studies did not report more than 50% (21/43) of the CONSORT-AI checklist items.\nThe quality of reporting of RCTs in AI is suboptimal. As reporting is variable in existing RCTs, caution should be exercised in interpreting the findings of some studies.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence and data-driven predictive modeling have become increasingly common tools integrated in clinical practice, heralding a new chapter of medicine in the digital era. While these techniques are poised to affect nearly all aspects of medicine, medical education as an institution has languished behind; this has raised concerns that the current training infrastructure is not adequately preparing future physicians for this changing clinical landscape. Our institution attempted to ameliorate this by implementing a novel artificial intelligence in radiology curriculum, \"AI-RADS,\" in two different educational formats: a 7-month lecture series and a one-day workshop intensive.\nThe curriculum was structured around foundational algorithms within artificial intelligence. As most residents have little computer science training, algorithms were initially presented as a series of simple observations around a relatable problem (e.g., fraud detection, movie recommendations, etc.). These observations were later re-framed to illustrate how a machine could apply the underlying concepts to perform clinically relevant tasks in the practice of radiology. Secondary lessons in basic computing, such as data representation/abstraction, were integrated as well. The lessons were ordered such that these algorithms were logical extensions of each other. The 7-month curriculum consisted of seven lectures paired with seven journal clubs, resulting in an AI-focused session every two weeks. The workshop consisted of six hours of content modified for the condensed format, with a final integrative activity.\nBoth formats of the AI-RADS curriculum were well received by learners, with the 7-month version and workshop garnering 9.8/10 and 4.3/5 ratings, respectively, for overall satisfaction. In both, there were increases in perceived understanding of artificial intelligence. In the 7-lecture course, 6/7 lectures achieved statistically significant (\nAs artificial intelligence becomes further enmeshed in clinical practice, it will become critical for physicians to have a basic understanding of how these tools work. Our AI-RADS curriculum demonstrates that it is successful in increasing learner perceived understanding in both an extended and condensed format.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a life-threatening disease, resulting in nearly 10 million deaths worldwide. There are various causes of cancer, and the prognostic information varies in each patient because of unique molecular signatures in the human body. However, genetic heterogeneity occurs due to different cancer types and changes in the neoplasms, which complicates the diagnosis and treatment. Targeted drug delivery is considered a pivotal contributor to precision medicine for cancer treatments as this method helps deliver medication to patients by systematically increasing the drug concentration on the targeted body parts. In such cases, nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) can help bridge the gap and enhance localized drug delivery systems capable of biomarker sensing. Diagnostic assays using nanoparticles (NPs) enable biomarker identification by accumulating in the specific cancer sites and ensuring accurate drug delivery planning. Integrating NPs for cancer targeting and AI can help devise sophisticated systems that further classify cancer types and understand complex disease patterns. Advanced AI algorithms can also help in biomarker detection, predicting different NP interactions of the targeted drug, and evaluating drug efficacy. Considering the advantages of the convergence of NPs and AI for targeted drug delivery, there has been significantly limited research focusing on the specific research theme, with most of the research being proposed on AI and drug discovery. Thus, the study's primary objective is to highlight the recent advances in drug delivery using NPs, and their impact on personalized treatment plans for cancer patients. In addition, a focal point of the study is also to highlight how integrating AI, and NPs can help address some of the existing challenges in drug delivery by conducting a collective survey.",

    "abstract": "Emotional Intelligence (EI) is first described by Salovey and Mayer as the ability to perceive and understand emotions and the ability to use them as supports for thoughts. Despite the great notoriety of EI, its definition remains not completely clear. An operative definition of EI can be achieved by studying its connection with other individual characteristics such as gender, personality traits, and fluid intelligence.\nThe sample was composed of 1,063 Italian subjects. A total of 330 participants were employed (31.0%; 57.9% men) and 702 were university students (66.0%; 38.7% men). The Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i), one of the most used questionnaires in literature, was used to measure EI. The exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) was used to assess the role of personality traits (five-factor model of personality) and fluid intelligence in EI. Statistical analyses on differences between men and women means of total and subscale EQ-i scores were estimated to evaluate whether EI, measured by EQ-i, is influenced by gender. Furthermore, a Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis was conducted to assess measurement invariance in relation to gender groups.\nEmotional Intelligence, measured by EQ-i, is prevalently connected with personality traits rather than fluid intelligence. Furthermore, men outperformed women in the Intrapersonal and Stress Management EI factors, and women outperformed men in the Interpersonal EI factor. No difference in the means of the EI total score and EI latent general factor did not differ between gender groups.\nEmotional Intelligence, measured by EQ-i, can be conceptually considered as a Trait EI. Furthermore, men are more capable to cope with negative events and to control impulses, while women are more able to distinguish, recognize, and comprehend others' emotions.",

    "abstract": "Because deep learning has various downsides, such as complexity, expense, and the need to wait longer for results, this creates a significant incentive and impetus to invent and adopt the notion of developing machine learning because it is simple. This study intended to increase the accuracy of machine-learning approaches for land use/land cover classification using Sentinel-2A, and Landsat-8 satellites. This study aimed to implement a proposed method, neural-based with object-based, to produce a model addressed by artificial neural networks (limited parameters) with random forest (hyperparameter) called ANN_RF. This study used multispectral satellite images (Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8) and a normalized digital elevation model as input datasets for the Sana'a city map of 2016. The results showed that the accuracy of the proposed model (ANN_RF) is better than the ANN classifier with the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 satellites individually, which may contribute to the development of machine learning through newer researchers and specialists; it also conventionally developed traditional artificial neural networks with seven to ten layers but with access to 1,000's and millions of simulated neurons without resorting to deep learning techniques (ANN_RF).",

The primary research institutions were Wuhan University, Tokyo University, and Tada Tomohiro Inst Gastroenterol and Proctol. Tada (n = 12) and Hirasawa (n = 90) were ranked first in the top 10 authors and co-cited authors, respectively. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (21 publications; IF 2022, 9.189; Q1) was the most published journal, while Gastric Cancer (133 citations; IF 2022, 8.171; Q1) was the most co-cited journal. Nevertheless, the cooperation between different countries and institutions should be further strengthened. The most common keywords were AI, gastric cancer, and convolutional neural network. The \"deep-learning algorithm\" started to burst in 2020 and continues till now, which indicated that this research topic has attracted continuous attention in recent years and would be the trend of research on AI application in GC.\nResearch related to AI in gastric cancer is increasing exponentially. Current research hotspots focus on the application of AI in gastric cancer, represented by convolutional neural networks and deep learning, in diagnosis and differential diagnosis and staging. Considering the great potential and clinical application prospects, the related area of AI applications in gastric cancer will remain a research hotspot in the future.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a major medical problem worldwide. Due to its high heterogeneity, the use of the same drugs or surgical methods in patients with the same tumor may have different curative effects, leading to the need for more accurate treatment methods for tumors and personalized treatments for patients. The precise treatment of tumors is essential, which renders obtaining an in-depth understanding of the changes that tumors undergo urgent, including changes in their genes, proteins and cancer cell phenotypes, in order to develop targeted treatment strategies for patients. Artificial intelligence (AI) based on big data can extract the hidden patterns, important information, and corresponding knowledge behind the enormous amount of data. For example, the ML and deep learning of subsets of AI can be used to mine the deep-level information in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, radiomics, digital pathological images, and other data, which can make clinicians synthetically and comprehensively understand tumors. In addition, AI can find new biomarkers from data to assist tumor screening, detection, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis prediction, so as to providing the best treatment for individual patients and improving their clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a kind of Lung Cancer (LCA) with high incidence rate, which is very harmful to human body. It is hidden in the human body and is not easy to be discovered, so it brings great inconvenience to the treatment of LUAD. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology provides technical support for the diagnosis and treatment of LUAD and has great application space in intelligent medicine. In this paper, 164 patients with primary LUAD who underwent surgery in Hospital A from January 2020 to December 2021 were selected as the study subjects, and the correlation between the imaging characteristics of LUAD and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene mutation was analyzed. Finally, the conclusion was drawn. In terms of the study on the correlation between EGFR mutation of LUAD and the imaging characteristics of Computed Tomography (CT), it was concluded that there were significant differences between the patient's sex, smoking history, pulmonary nodule morphology and the EGFR gene, and there was no significant difference between the patient's tumor size and EGFR gene; in the study of the relationship between EGFR gene mutation and CT signs of LUAD lesions, it was found that there were significant differences between the symptoms of cavity sign, hair prick sign and chest depression sign and EGFR gene, but there was no significant difference between the symptoms of lobulation sign and EGFR gene; in the study of pathological subtype and EGFR gene mutation status of LUAD patients, it was concluded that the pathological subtype was mainly micropapillary. The mutation rate was 44.44%, which was the highest; in terms of CT manifestations of adjacent structures of lung cancer and the study of EGFR gene mutation status, it was found that there was a statistical difference between the tumor with vascular convergence sign and EGFR gene mutation, and pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, pleural thickening and other signs in tumor imaging were not significantly associated with EGFR gene mutation; in terms of the study of CT manifestations of adjacent structures of LCA and EGFR gene mutation status, it was concluded that pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, pleural thickening and other signs in tumor images were not significantly associated with EGFR gene mutation; in terms of analysis and cure of LUAD, it was concluded that the cure rate of patients was relatively high, and only a few people died of ineffective treatment. This paper provided a reference for the field of intelligent medicine and physical health.",

    "abstract": "Rare disease diagnosis is challenging in medical image-based artificial intelligence due to a natural class imbalance in datasets, leading to biased prediction models. Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a research domain that particularly faces this issue. This study investigates the applicability of synthetic data in improving artificial intelligence-enabled diagnosis of IRDs using generative adversarial networks (GANs).\nDiagnostic study of gene-labeled fundus autofluorescence (FAF) IRD images using deep learning.\nMoorfields Eye Hospital (MEH) dataset of 15\u00a0692 FAF images obtained from 1800 patients with confirmed genetic diagnosis of 1 of 36 IRD genes.\nA StyleGAN2 model is trained on the IRD dataset to generate 512\u00a0\u00d7 512 resolution images. Convolutional neural networks are trained for classification using different synthetically augmented datasets, including real IRD images plus 1800 and 3600 synthetic images, and a fully rebalanced dataset. We also perform an experiment with only synthetic data. All models are compared against a baseline convolutional neural network trained only on real data.\nWe evaluated synthetic data quality using a Visual Turing Test conducted with 4 ophthalmologists from MEH. Synthetic and real images were compared using feature space visualization, similarity analysis to detect memorized images, and Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE) score for no-reference-based quality evaluation. Convolutional neural network diagnostic performance was determined on a held-out test set using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and Cohen's Kappa (\u03ba).\nAn average true recognition rate of 63% and fake recognition rate of 47% was obtained from the Visual Turing Test. Thus, a considerable proportion of the synthetic images were classified as real by clinical experts. Similarity analysis showed that the synthetic images were not copies of the real images, indicating that\u00a0copied real images, meaning the GAN was able to generalize. However, BRISQUE score analysis indicated that synthetic images were of significantly lower quality overall than real images (\nSynthetic generation of realistic IRD FAF images is feasible. Synthetic data augmentation does not deliver improvements in classification performance. However, synthetic data alone deliver a similar performance as real data, and hence may be useful as a proxy to real data. ",

Therefore, it is critical to accurately screen individuals for immunotherapy sensitivity and forecast its efficacy. With the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical field in recent years, an increasing number of studies have indicated that the efficacy of immunotherapy can be better anticipated with the help of AI technology to reach precision medicine. This article focuses on the current prediction models based on information from histopathological slides, imaging-omics, genomics, and proteomics, and reviews their research progress and applications. Furthermore, we also discuss the existing challenges encountered by AI in the field of immunotherapy, as well as the future directions that need to be improved, to provide a point of reference for the early implementation of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment systems in the future.",

    "abstract": "Home healthcare in the Italian health system has proven to be an essential factor in adequately responding to the health needs of an increasingly aging population. The opportunities offered by digitization and new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, are a lever for making home care services more effective and efficient on the one hand, and on the other for improving remote patient monitoring. Telemedicine devices have enormous potential for telemonitoring and telerehabilitation of patients suffering from chronic disabling diseases; in particular, AI systems can now provide very useful managerial and decision-making support in numerous clinical areas. AI combined with digitalization, could also allow for the remote monitoring of patients' health conditions. In this paper authors describe some digital and healthcare tools or system of AI, such as the Connected Care model, the Home Care Premium (HCP) project, The Resilia App and some professional service robotics. In this context, to optimize potential and concrete healthcare improvements, some limits need to be overcome: gaps in health information systems and digital tools at all levels of the Italian National Health Service, the slow dissemination of the computerized medical record, issues of digital literacy, the high cost of devices, the poor protection of data privacy. The danger of over-reliance on such systems should also be examined. Therefore the legal systems of the various countries, including Italy, should indicate clear decision-making paths for the patient.",

    "abstract": "Although numerous organ-on-a-chips have been developed, bone-on-a-chip platforms have rarely been reported because of the high complexity of the bone microenvironment. With an increase in the elderly population, a high-risk group for bone-related diseases such as osteoporosis, it is essential to develop a precise bone-mimicking model for efficient drug screening and accurate evaluation in preclinical studies. Here, we developed a high-throughput biomimetic bone-on-a-chip platform combined with an artificial intelligence (AI)-based image analysis system. To recapitulate the key aspects of natural bone microenvironment, mouse osteocytes (IDG-SW3) and osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) were cocultured within the osteoblast-derived decellularized extracellular matrix (OB-dECM) built in a well plate-based three-dimensional gel unit. This platform spatiotemporally and configurationally mimics the characteristics of the structural bone unit, known as the osteon. Combinations of native and bioactive ingredients obtained from the OB-dECM and coculture of two types of bone cells synergistically enhanced osteogenic functions such as osteocyte differentiation and osteoblast maturation. This platform provides a uniform and transparent imaging window that facilitates the observation of cell-cell interactions and features high-throughput bone units in a well plate that is compatible with a high-content screening system, enabling fast and easy drug tests. The drug efficacy of anti-SOST antibody, which is a newly developed osteoporosis drug for bone formation, was tested via \u03b2-catenin translocation analysis, and the performance of the platform was evaluated using AI-based deep learning analysis. This platform could be a cutting-edge translational tool for bone-related diseases and an efficient alternative to bone models for the development of promising drugs.",

    "abstract": "Brain tumors are a widespread and serious neurological phenomenon that can be life- threatening. The computing field has allowed for the development of artificial intelligence (AI), which can mimic the neural network of the human brain. One use of this technology has been to help researchers capture hidden, high-dimensional images of brain tumors. These images can provide new insights into the nature of brain tumors and help to improve treatment options. AI and precision medicine (PM) are converging to revolutionize healthcare. AI has the potential to improve cancer imaging interpretation in several ways, including more accurate tumor genotyping, more precise delineation of tumor volume, and better prediction of clinical outcomes. AI-assisted brain surgery can be an effective and safe option for treating brain tumors. This review discusses various AI and PM techniques that can be used in brain tumor treatment. These new techniques for the treatment of brain tumors, i.e., genomic profiling, microRNA panels, quantitative imaging, and radiomics, hold great promise for the future. However, there are challenges that must be overcome for these technologies to reach their full potential and improve healthcare.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) diagnosis system for uterine smooth muscle tumors (UMTs) by using deep learning. We analyzed the morphological features of UMTs on whole-slide images (233, 108, and 30 digital slides of leiomyosarcomas, leiomyomas, and smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential stained with hematoxylin and eosin, respectively). Aperio ImageScope software randomly selected \u226510 areas of the total field of view. Pathologists randomly selected a marked region in each section that was no smaller than the total area of 10 high-power fields in which necrotic, vascular, collagenous, and mitotic areas were labeled. We constructed an automatic identification algorithm for cytological atypia and necrosis by using ResNet and constructed an automatic detection algorithm for mitosis by using YOLOv5. A logical evaluation algorithm was then designed to obtain an automatic UMT diagnostic aid that can \"study and synthesize\" a pathologist's experience. The precision, recall, and F1 index reached more than 0.920. The detection network could accurately detect the mitoses (0.913 precision, 0.893 recall). For the prediction ability, the AI system had a precision of 0.90. An AI-assisted system for diagnosing UMTs in routine practice scenarios is feasible and can improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "The intensive care unit is a center for massive data collection, making it the best field to embrace big data and artificial intelligence.\nThis study aimed to provide a literature overview on the development of artificial intelligence in critical care medicine (CCM) and tried to give valuable information about further precision medicine.\nRelevant studies published between January 2010 and June 2021 were manually retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded database in Web of Science (Clarivate), using keywords.\nResearch related to artificial intelligence in CCM has been increasing over the years. The USA published the most articles and had the top 10 active affiliations. The top ten active journals are bioinformatics journals and are in JCR Q1. Prediction, diagnosis, and treatment strategy exploration of sepsis, pneumonia, and acute kidney injury were the most focused topics. Electronic health records (EHRs) were the most widely used data and the \"-omics\" data should be integrated further.\nArtificial intelligence in CCM has developed over the past decade. With the introduction of constantly growing data volume and novel data types, more investigation on artificial intelligence ethics and model correctness and extrapolation should be performed for generalization.",

    "abstract": "There is currently no simple, widely available screening method for Alzheimer's disease (AD), partly because the diagnosis of AD is complex and typically involves expensive and sometimes invasive tests not commonly available outside highly specialized clinical settings. Here, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered end-to-end system to detect AD and predict its severity directly from voice recordings. At the core of our system is the pre-trained data2vec model, the first high-performance self-supervised algorithm that works for speech, vision, and text. Our model was internally evaluated on the ADReSSo (Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech ",

    "abstract": "Emotion is a compelling factor in the retention and job satisfaction of professionals, and the impacts of emotional feelings and reactions have become an indispensable issue in the nursing workforce. Drawing on the cognitive theory of emotions, this study bridges the research gap to investigate the relationships among emotional blackmail, emotional intelligence, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions of nurses. A cross-sectional design was used to collect data from a sample of 374 full-time nurses in Northern Taiwan. Hypotheses were tested and analyzed by means of SPSS 22, structural equation modeling (SEM), and PROCESS v3.3. The results revealed the direct relationships between emotional blackmail, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions, and job satisfaction partially mediated the relationship between emotional blackmail and turnover intentions. However, there is no statistical support that emotional intelligence moderates the relationships between emotional blackmail and job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Healthcare organizations must take the initiative and form strategies that will help balance nurses' work stresses. These strategies should aim to reduce unnecessary demands from supervisors, patients, and co-workers, as well as in the socio-emotional domain.",

    "abstract": "The green leadership (GL) concept has significantly gained popularity over the last decade. Consequently, more research has been conducted on this emerging leadership concept, emphasizing leadership styles that promote the green environment so that sustainable goals can be achieved. In the present research, leaders' emotional intelligence (EI) is positioned as a mediating variable between GL and employees' green organizational citizenship behavior (GOCB). The data of this research comprised managerial and non-managerial staff from the manufacturing and service industries. A PLS-SEM was used to evaluate the relationship between the various factors among 422 employees. The empirical findings indicated that GL and GOCB had a favorable and robust relationship. The results of the study also suggested that a leader's EI mediates the influence of green leadership on their employees' green organizational citizenship behavior. Green leadership is essential in creating sustainable environmental behaviors among employees. It can strengthen leaders' EI, which successively helps them to garner positivity and foster an environment of mutual harmony and cooperation in the workplace to support pro-environmental policies. Overall, our study contributes to and advances previous studies and shows that green leadership plays a critical role in influencing a leader's own EI which, in turn, predicts the green OCB of their employees in the workplace.",

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most serious health problems worldwide. Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is most commonly caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Currently, endoscopic detection of early gastric cancer (EGC) and CAG remains challenging for endoscopists, and the diagnostic accuracy of H. pylori infection by endoscopy is approximately 70%. Artificial intelligence (AI) can assist endoscopic diagnosis including detection, prediction of depth of invasion, boundary delineation, and anatomical location of EGC, and has achievable diagnostic ability even comparable to experienced endoscopists. In this review we summarized various AI-assisted systems in the diagnosis of EGC, CAG, and H. pylori infection.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence can be defined as \"understanding human thinking and trying to develop computer processes that will produce a similar structure.\" Thus, it is an attempt by a programmed computer to think. According to a broader definition, artificial intelligence is a computer equipped with human intelligencespecific capacities such as acquiring information, perceiving, seeing, thinking, and making decisions. Quality demands in dental treatments have constantly been increasing in recent years. In parallel with this, using image-based methods and multimedia-supported explanation systems on the computer is becoming widespread to evaluate the available information. The use of artificial intelligence in dentistry will greatly contribute to the reduction of treatment times and the effort spent by the dentist, reduce the need for a specialist dentist, and give a new perspective to how dentistry is practiced. In this review, we aim to review the studies conducted with artificial intelligence in dentistry and to inform our dentists about the existence of this new technology.",

    "abstract": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) represents a real game changer in today's landscape of breast cancer imaging. Several innovative AI-based tools have been developed and validated in recent years that promise to accelerate the goal of real patient-tailored management. Numerous studies confirm that proper integration of AI into existing clinical workflows could bring significant benefits to women, radiologists, and healthcare systems. The AI-based approach has proved particularly useful for developing new risk prediction models that integrate multi-data streams for planning individualized screening protocols. Furthermore, AI models could help radiologists in the pre-screening and lesion detection phase, increasing diagnostic accuracy, while reducing workload and complications related to overdiagnosis. Radiomics and radiogenomics approaches could extrapolate the so-called imaging signature of the tumor to plan a targeted treatment. The main challenges to the development of AI tools are the huge amounts of high-quality data required to train and validate these models and the need for a multidisciplinary team with solid machine-learning skills. The purpose of this article is to present a summary of the most important AI applications in breast cancer imaging, analyzing possible challenges and new perspectives related to the widespread adoption of these new tools.",

    "abstract": "Artificial-intelligence (AI)-based predictive analytics provide new opportunities to leverage rich sources of continuous data to improve patient care through early warning of the risk of clinical deterioration and improved situational awareness.Part of the success of predictive analytic implementation relies on integration of the analytic within complex clinical workflows. Pharmaceutical interventions have off-target uses where a drug indication has not been formally studied for a different indication but has potential for clinical benefit. An analog has not been described in the context of AI-based predictive analytics, that is, when a predictive analytic has been trained on one outcome of interest but is used for additional applications in clinical practice.\nIn this manuscript we present three clinical vignettes describing off-target use of AI-based predictive analytics that evolved organically through real-world practice.\nOff-target uses included:real-time feedback about treatment effectiveness, indication of readiness to discharge, and indication of the acuity of a hospital unit.\nSuch practice fits well with the learning health system goals to continuously integrate data and experience to provide.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerged as an intervention for data and number-related problems. This breakthrough has led to several technological advancements in virtually all fields from engineering to architecture, education, accounting, business, health, and so on. AI has come a long way in healthcare, having played significant roles in data and information storage and management - such as patient medical histories, medicine stocks, sale records, and so on; automated machines; software and computer applications like diagnostic tools such as MRI radiation technology, CT diagnosis and many more have all been created to aid and simplify healthcare measures. Inarguably, AI has revolutionized healthcare to be more effective and efficient and the pharmacy sector is not left out. During the past few years, a considerable amount of increasing interest in the uses of AI technology has been identified for analyzing as well as interpreting some important fields of pharmacy like drug discovery, dosage form designing, polypharmacology, and hospital pharmacy. Given the growing importance of AI, we wanted to create a comprehensive report which helps every practicing pharmacist understand the biggest breakthroughs which are assisted by the deployment of this field.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the primary cause of central vision impairment in patients with diabetes and the leading cause of preventable blindness in working-age people. With the advent of optical coherence tomography and antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy, the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of DME were greatly revolutionized in the last decade. However, there is tremendous heterogeneity among DME patients, and 30%-50% of DME patients do not respond well to anti-VEGF agents. In addition, there is no evidence-based and universally accepted administration regimen. The identification of DME patients not responding to anti-VEGF agents and the determination of the optimal administration interval are the 2 major challenges of DME, which are difficult to achieve with the coarse granularity of conventional health care modality. Therefore, more and more retina specialists have pointed out the necessity of introducing precision medicine into the management of DME and have conducted related studies in recent years. One of the most frontier methods is the targeted extraction of individualized disease features from optical coherence tomography images based on artificial intelligence technology, which provides precise evaluation and risk classification of DME. This review aims to provide an overview of the progress of artificial intelligence-enabled precision medicine in automated screening, precise evaluation, prognosis prediction, and follow-up monitoring of DME. Further, the challenges ahead of real-world applications and the future development of precision medicine in DME will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "When surgical resection is indicated for a congenital lung abnormality (CLA), lobectomy is often preferred over segmentectomy, mostly because the latter is associated with more residual disease. Presumably, this occurs in children because sublobar surgery often does not adhere to anatomical borders (wedge resection instead of segmentectomy), thus increasing the risk of residual disease. This study investigated the feasibility of identifying eligible cases for anatomical segmentectomy by combining virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI).\nSemi-automated segmentation of bronchovascular structures and lesions were visualized with VR and AI technology. Two specialists independently evaluated via a questionnaire the informative value of regular computed tomography versus three-dimensional (3D) VR images.\nFive asymptomatic, non-operated cases were selected. Bronchovascular segmentation, volume calculation and image visualization in the VR environment were successful in all cases. Based on the computed tomography images, assignment of the CLA lesion to specific lung segments matched between the consulted specialists in only 1 out of the cases. Based on the three 3D VR images, however, the localization matched in 3 of the 5 cases. If the patients would have been operated, adding the 3D VR tool to the preoperative workup would have resulted in changing the surgical strategy (i.e. lobectomy versus segmentectomy) in 4 cases.\nThis study demonstrated the technical feasibility of a hybridized AI-VR visualization of segment-level lung anatomy in patients with CLA. Further exploration of the value of 3D VR in identifying eligible cases for anatomical segmentectomy is therefore warranted.",

    "results": "Five asymptomatic, non-operated cases were selected. Bronchovascular segmentation, volume calculation and image visualization in the VR environment were successful in all cases. Based on the computed tomography images, assignment of the CLA lesion to specific lung segments matched between the consulted specialists in only 1 out of the cases. Based on the three 3D VR images, however, the localization matched in 3 of the 5 cases. If the patients would have been operated, adding the 3D VR tool to the preoperative workup would have resulted in changing the surgical strategy (i.e. lobectomy versus segmentectomy) in 4 cases.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, the use of artificial intelligence has been widely explored in health care. Similarly, the amount of data generated in the most varied medical processes has practically doubled every year, requiring new methods of analysis and treatment of these data. Mainly aimed at aiding in the diagnosis and prevention of diseases, this precision medicine has shown great potential in different medical disciplines. Laboratory tests, for example, almost always present their results separately as individual values. However, physicians need to analyze a set of results to propose a supposed diagnosis, which leads us to think that sets of laboratory tests may contain more information than those presented separately for each result. In this way, the processes of medical laboratories can be strongly affected by these techniques.\nIn this sense, we sought to identify scientific research that used laboratory tests and machine learning techniques to predict hidden information and diagnose diseases.\nThe methodology adopted used the population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes principle, searching the main engineering and health sciences databases. The search terms were defined based on the list of terms used in the Medical Subject Heading database. Data from this study were presented descriptively and followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; 2020) statement flow diagram and the National Institutes of Health tool for quality assessment of articles. During the analysis, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were independently applied by 2 authors, with a third author being consulted in cases of disagreement.\nFollowing the defined requirements, 40 studies presenting good quality in the analysis process were selected and evaluated. We found that, in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of works that have used this methodology, mainly because of COVID-19. In general, the studies used machine learning classification models to predict new information, and the most used parameters were data from routine laboratory tests such as the complete blood count.\nFinally, we conclude that laboratory tests, together with machine learning techniques, can predict new tests, thus helping the search for new diagnoses. This process has proved to be advantageous and innovative for medical laboratories. It is making it possible to discover hidden information and propose additional tests, reducing the number of false negatives and helping in the early discovery of unknown diseases.",

    "abstract": "Timely referral for specialist evaluation in patients with advanced heart failure (HF) is a Class 1 recommendation. However, the transition from stage C HF to advanced or stage D HF often goes undetected in routine care, resulting in delayed referral and higher mortality rates.\nThe authors sought to develop an augmented intelligence-enabled workflow using machine learning to identify patients with stage D HF and streamline referral.\nWe extracted data on HF patients with encounters from January 1, 2007, to November 30, 2020, from a HF registry within a regional, integrated health system. We created an ensemble machine learning model to predict stage C or stage D HF and integrated the results within the electronic health record.\nIn a retrospective data set of 14,846 patients, the model had a good positive predictive value (60%) and low sensitivity (25%) for identifying stage D HF in a 100-person, physician-reviewed, holdout test set. During prospective implementation of the workflow from April 1, 2021, to February 15, 2022, 416 patients were reviewed by a clinical coordinator, with agreement between the model and the coordinator in 50.3% of stage D predictions. Twenty-four patients have been scheduled for evaluation in a HF clinic, 4 patients started an evaluation for advanced therapies, and 1 patient received a left ventricular assist device.\nAn augmented intelligence-enabled workflow was integrated into clinical operations to identify patients with advanced HF. Endeavors such as this require a multidisciplinary team with experience in design thinking, informatics, quality improvement, operations, and health information technology, as well as dedicated resources to monitor and improve performance over time.",

    "abstract": "We trained an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to identify basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and to distinguish BCC from histological mimics. A total of 1061 glass slides were collected: 616 containing BCC and 445 without BCC. BCC slides were collected prospectively, reflecting the range of specimen types and morphological variety encountered in routine pathology practice. Benign and malignant histological mimics of BCC were selected prospectively and retrospectively, including cases considered diagnostically challenging for pathologists. Glass slides were digitally scanned to create a whole slide image (WSI), which was divided into patches representing a tissue area of 65,535 \u03bcm",

    "abstract": "Fluid intelligence, the ability to solve novel, complex problems, declines steeply during healthy human aging. Using fMRI, fluid intelligence has been repeatedly associated with activation of a frontoparietal brain network, and impairment following focal damage to these regions suggests that fluid intelligence depends on their integrity. It is therefore possible that age-related functional differences in frontoparietal activity contribute to the reduction in fluid intelligence. This paper reports on analysis of the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience data, a large, population-based cohort of healthy males and females across the adult lifespan. The data support a model in which age-related differences in fluid intelligence are partially mediated by the responsiveness of frontoparietal regions to novel problem-solving. We first replicate a prior finding of such mediation using an independent sample. We then precisely localize the mediating brain regions, and show that mediation is specifically associated with voxels most activated by cognitive demand, but not with voxels suppressed by cognitive demand. We quantify the robustness of this result to potential unmodeled confounders, and estimate the causal direction of the effects. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest that neural mediation of age-related differences in fluid intelligence is moderated by the variety of regular physical activities, more reliably than by their frequency or duration. An additional moderating role of the variety of nonphysical activities emerged when controlling for head motion. A better understanding of the mechanisms that link healthy aging with lower fluid intelligence may suggest strategies for mitigating such decline.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, I have described the healthcare problem (maldistribution of doctors) in India. Later, I have introduced the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) and I have described AI technology with various examples, how it is rapidly changing the healthcare scenario across the world. I have also described the various advantages of artificial intelligence technology. At the end of the paper, I have raised some serious concerns regarding complete replacement of human based healthcare technology with artificial intelligence technology. I concluded that there is not the slightest question that AI will influence the future. People must be innovative, insightful, and context-aware for AI to work. This is because humans will continue to contribute value that cannot be reproduced by robots.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a type of immune-mediated pancreatitis subdivided into two subtypes, type 1 and type 2 AIP. Furthermore, type 1 AIP is considered to be the pancreatic manifestation of the immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease. Nowadays, AIP is increasingly researched and recognized, although its diagnosis represents a challenge for several reasons: False positive ultrasound-guided cytological samples for a neoplastic process, difficult to interpret levels of IgG4, the absence of biological markers to diagnose type 2 AIP, and the challenging clinical identification of atypical forms. Furthermore, 60% and 78% of type 1 and type 2 AIP, respectively, are retrospectively diagnosed on surgical specimens of resected pancreas for suspected cancer. As distinguishing AIP from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma can be challenging, obtaining a definitive diagnosis can therefore prove difficult, since endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration or biopsy of the pancreas are suboptimal. This paper focuses on recent innovations in the management of AIP with regard to the use of artificial intelligence, new serum markers, and new therapeutic approaches, while it also outlines the current management recommendations. A better knowledge of AIP can reduce the recourse to surgery and avoid its overuse, although such an approach requires close collaboration between gastroenterologists, surgeons and radiologists. Better knowledge on AIP and IgG4-related disease remains necessary to diagnose and manage patients.",

    "abstract": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an inexpensive and easily accessible investigation for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases including heart failure (HF). The application of artificial intelligence (AI) has contributed to clinical practice in terms of aiding diagnosis, prognosis, risk stratification and guiding clinical management. The aim of this study is to systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of published studies on the application of AI for HF detection based on the ECG.\nWe searched Embase, PubMed and Web of Science databases to identify literature using AI for HF detection based on ECG data. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) criteria. Random-effects models were used for calculating the effect estimates and hierarchical receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted. Subgroup analysis was performed. Heterogeneity and the risk of bias were also assessed.\nA total of 11 studies including 104,737 subjects were included. The area under the curve for HF diagnosis was 0.986, with a corresponding pooled sensitivity of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.86-0.98), specificity of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.95-0.99) and diagnostic odds ratio of 831.51 (95% CI: 127.85-5407.74). In the patient selection domain of QUADAS-2, eight studies were designated as high risk.\nAccording to the available evidence, the incorporation of AI can aid the diagnosis of HF. However, there is heterogeneity among machine learning algorithms and improvements are required in terms of quality and study design.",

    "abstract": "Lenvatinib has been effective not only as a first-line but also as a later-line systemic therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) in real-world clinical practice. How to predict the efficacy of lenvatinib and guide appropriate therapy selection in patients with uHCC have become important issues. This study aimed to investigate the impact of serum biomarkers on the treatment outcomes of patients with uHCC treated with lenvatinib in a real-world setting using an artificial intelligence algorithm. We measured serum biomarkers, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, and circulating angiogenic factors (CAFs [i.e., vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin-2, fibroblast growth factor-19 [FGF19], and FGF21]) and analyzed treatment outcomes, including objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with uHCC treated with lenvatinib. The results of this study demonstrated that an AFP reduction \u2265 40% from baseline within 8 weeks after lenvatinib induction was associated with a higher ORR. With baseline biomarkers using a decision tree-based model, we identified patients with high, intermediate, and low ORRs (84.6%, 21.7% and 0%, respectively; odds ratio, 53.04, P < 0.001, high versus intermediate/low groups). Based on the decision tree-based survival predictive model, baseline AFP was the most important factor for OS, followed by ALBI grade and FGF21.",

    "abstract": "To examine the current landscape of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved artificial intelligence (AI) medical imaging devices and identify trends in clinical validation strategy.\nA retrospective study was conducted that analysed data extracted from the American College of Radiology (ACR) Data Science Institute AI Central database as of November 2021 to identify trends in FDA clearance of AI products related to medical imaging. Product and clinical validation information of each device was gathered from their respective public 510(k) summary or de novo request submission, depending on their type of authorisation.\nOverall, the database included a total of 151 AI algorithms that were cleared by the FDA between 2008 and November 2021. Out of the 151 FDA summaries reviewed, 97 (64.2%) reported the use of clinical data to validate their device, with six (4%) revealing study participant demographics, and eight (5.3%) reporting the specifications of the machines used. A total of 51 (33.8%) AI devices characterised their clinical data as multicentre, three (2%) as single-centre, and the remaining 97 (64.2%) did not specify. The ground truth used for clinical validation was specified in 78 (51.6%) FDA summaries.\nA wide breadth of AI algorithms has been developed for medical imaging. Most of the FDA summaries of the devices mention their use of clinical data and patient cases for device validation; however, few devices revealed the patient demographics or machine specifications used in their clinical studies, which may lead some consumers to question their external validation.",

These debates have had the corollary of undermining, if not altogether neglecting, the materiality and corporeality of cognition-treating material, living processes as \"hardware\" problems that can be abstracted out and, in principle, implemented in a variety of materials-in particular on digital computers and in the form of state-of-the-art neural networks.

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) led to a dramatic increase in the number of cases of patients with pneumonia worldwide. In this study, we aimed to develop an AI-assisted multistrategy image enhancement technique for chest X-ray (CXR) images to improve the accuracy of COVID-19 classification.\nOur new classification strategy consisted of 3 parts. First, the improved U-Net model with a variational encoder segmented the lung region in the CXR images processed by histogram equalization. Second, the residual net (ResNet) model with multidilated-rate convolution layers was used to suppress the bone signals in the 217 lung-only CXR images. A total of 80% of the available data were allocated for training and validation. The other 20% of the remaining data were used for testing. The enhanced CXR images containing only soft tissue information were obtained. Third, the neural network model with a residual cascade was used for the super-resolution reconstruction of low-resolution bone-suppressed CXR images. The training and testing data consisted of 1,200 and 100 CXR images, respectively. To evaluate the new strategy, improved visual geometry group (VGG)-16 and ResNet-18 models were used for the COVID-19 classification task of 2,767 CXR images. The accuracy of the multistrategy enhanced CXR images was verified through comparative experiments with various enhancement images. In terms of quantitative verification, 8-fold cross-validation was performed on the bone suppression model. In terms of evaluating the COVID-19 classification, the CXR images obtained by the improved method were used to train 2 classification models.\nCompared with other methods, the CXR images obtained based on the proposed model had better performance in the metrics of peak signal-to-noise ratio and root mean square error. The super-resolution CXR images of bone suppression obtained based on the neural network model were also anatomically close to the real CXR images. Compared with the initial CXR images, the classification accuracy rates of the internal and external testing data on the VGG-16 model increased by 5.09% and 12.81%, respectively, while the values increased by 3.51% and 18.20%, respectively, for the ResNet-18 model. The numerical results were better than those of the single-enhancement, double-enhancement, and no-enhancement CXR images.\nThe multistrategy enhanced CXR images can help to classify COVID-19 more accurately than the other existing methods.",

    "results": "Compared with other methods, the CXR images obtained based on the proposed model had better performance in the metrics of peak signal-to-noise ratio and root mean square error. The super-resolution CXR images of bone suppression obtained based on the neural network model were also anatomically close to the real CXR images. Compared with the initial CXR images, the classification accuracy rates of the internal and external testing data on the VGG-16 model increased by 5.09% and 12.81%, respectively, while the values increased by 3.51% and 18.20%, respectively, for the ResNet-18 model. The numerical results were better than those of the single-enhancement, double-enhancement, and no-enhancement CXR images.",

    "abstract": "G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of membrane proteins with pluridimensional signaling profiles. They undergo ligand-specific conformational changes, which in turn lead to the differential activation of intracellular signaling proteins and the consequent triggering of a variety of biological responses. This conformational plasticity directly impacts our understanding of GPCR signaling and therapeutic implications, as do ligand-specific kinetic differences in GPCR-induced transducer activation/coupling or GPCR-transducer complex stability. High-resolution experimental structures of ligand-bound GPCRs in the presence or absence of interacting transducers provide important, yet limited, insights into the highly dynamic process of ligand-induced activation or inhibition of these receptors. We and others have complemented these studies with computational strategies aimed at characterizing increasingly accurate metastable conformations of GPCRs using a combination of metadynamics simulations, state-of-the-art algorithms for statistical analyses of simulation data, and artificial intelligence-based tools. This minireview provides an overview of these approaches as well as lessons learned from them towards the identification of conformational states that may be difficult or even impossible to characterize experimentally and yet important to discover new GPCR ligands.",

Invitees were identified through various email listings and social media. We conducted a descriptive analysis and explored whether survey responses varied according to respondents' previous training in AI and level of clinical experience (i.e., residents vs. experienced doctors).\nIn total, 165 French pediatricians participated in the study (median age 27 years, women 78%, residents 64%). While 90% of participants declared they understood the term \"artificial intelligence\", only 40% understood the term \"deep learning\". Most participants expected AI would lead to improvements in healthcare (e.g., better access to healthcare, 80%; diagnostic assistance, 71%), and 86% declared they would favor implementing AI tools in pediatrics. Fifty-nine percent of respondents declared seeing AI as a threat to medical data security and 35% as a threat to the ethical and human dimensions of medicine. Thirty-nine percent of respondents feared losing clinical skills because of AI, and 6% feared losing their job because of AI. Only 5% of respondents had received specific training in AI, while 87% considered implementing such programs would be necessary. Respondents who received training in AI had significantly better knowledge and a higher probability of having encountered AI tools in their medical practice (\nIn this survey, most young French pediatricians had favorable views toward AI, but a large proportion expressed concerns regarding the ethical, societal, and professional issues linked with the implementation of AI.",

    "abstract": "Globally, gastric cancer is the third leading cause of death from tumors. Prevention and individualized treatment are considered to be the best options for reducing the mortality rate of gastric cancer. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been widely used in the field of gastric cancer, including diagnosis, prognosis, and image analysis. Eligible papers were identified from PubMed and IEEE up to April 13, 2022. Through the comparison of these articles, the application status of AI technology in the diagnosis of gastric cancer was summarized, including application types, application scenarios, advantages and limitations. This review presents the current state and role of AI in the diagnosis of gastric cancer based on four aspects: 1) accurate sampling from early diagnosis (endoscopy), 2) digital pathological diagnosis, 3) molecules and genes, and 4) clinical big data analysis and prognosis prediction. AI plays a very important role in facilitating the diagnosis of gastric cancer; however, it also has shortcomings such as interpretability. The purpose of this review is to provide assistance to researchers working in this domain.",

    "abstract": "Teaching for creativity (TfC) has received increasing attention as an important way to cultivate students' creative thinking and behaviors. The purpose of this study is to examine the mediating role of teachers' work engagement (WE) on the relationship between their emotional intelligence (EI) and teaching for creativity. The study is a cross-sectional design. The sample of the study is 3,307 secondary school English teachers working in Jilin Province, China. The findings show that the teachers' perceptions of emotional intelligence, work engagement and teaching for creativity are relatively high. The findings confirm the hypotheses. The results of structural equation modeling and bootstrapping show that teachers' emotional intelligence is positively correlated with work engagement and teaching for creativity, and teachers' work engagement mediates the relationship between emotional intelligence and teaching for creativity.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. There is no treatment and AD models have focused on a small subset of genes identified in familial AD. Microarray studies have identified thousands of dysregulated genes in the brains of patients with AD yet identifying the best gene candidates to both model and treat AD remains a challenge. We performed a meta-analysis of microarray data from the frontal cortex (n\u00a0=\u00a0697) and cerebellum (n\u00a0=\u00a0230) of AD patients and healthy controls. A two-stage artificial intelligence approach, with both unsupervised and supervised machine learning, combined with a functional network analysis was used to identify functionally connected and biologically relevant novel gene candidates in AD. We found that in the frontal cortex, genes involved in mitochondrial energy, ATP, and oxidative phosphorylation, were the most significant dysregulated genes. In the cerebellum, dysregulated genes were involved in mitochondrial cellular biosynthesis (mitochondrial ribosomes). Although there was little overlap between dysregulated genes between the frontal cortex and cerebellum, machine learning models comprised of this overlap. A further functional network analysis of these genes identified that two downregulated genes, ATP5L and ATP5H, which both encode subunits of ATP synthase (mitochondrial complex V) may play a role in AD. Combined, our results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly a deficit in energy homeostasis, may play an important role in AD.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, using machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and neural networks (NNs). AI enables machines to learn from experience and perform human-like tasks. The field of AI research has been developing fast over the past five to ten years, due to the rise of 'big data' and increasing computing power. In the medical area, AI can be used to improve diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, surgery, drug discovery, or for other applications. Therefore, both academia and industry are investing a lot in AI. This review investigates the biomedical literature (in the PubMed and Embase databases) by looking at bibliographical data, observing trends over time and occurrences of keywords. Some observations are made: AI has been growing exponentially over the past few years; it is used mostly for diagnosis; COVID-19 is already in the top-3 of diseases studied using AI; China, the United States, South Korea, the United Kingdom and Canada are publishing the most articles in AI research; Stanford University is the world's leading university in AI research; and convolutional NNs are by far the most popular DL algorithms at this moment. These trends could be studied in more detail, by studying more literature databases or by including patent databases. More advanced analyses could be used to predict in which direction AI will develop over the coming years. The expectation is that AI will keep on growing, in spite of stricter privacy laws, more need for standardization, bias in the data, and the need for building trust.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence-based imaging is a low-cost, radiation-free solution for the breast imaging process that uses infrared radiation emitted by the body. This is a novel procedure that, when feasible, could be a better solution, particularly in underprivileged communities having low access to breast health care.\nTo assess the acceptance and explore challenges for an artificial intelligence-based screening solution for breast health among the urban slum population.\nA mixed-method study was conducted in urban slums of central Karnataka, India.\nThe study was carried out for a period of two years in 2019-21 among women in the reproductive age group in urban slums of central Karnataka to understand the acceptance of an artificial intelligence-based imaging solution for screening breast health. In-depth interviews were conducted to identify the strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and challenges (SWOC) screening for breast health.\nQuantitative data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v16.0, and for qualitative data, manual descriptive content analysis was carried out, and the sub-themes were generated.\nA total of 768 women accessed the thermalytix \u00ae breast imaging services, the majority of them in the age group 31-40 years (35%), belonging to the Muslim religion (68.5%) with a mean monthly family income of Rs. 11,950.67/- SWOC analysis identified reduced cost for the screening services and involvement of female self-help groups (SHGs) as strengths. Weaknesses included poor breast health awareness among women and the stigma associated with breast cancer.\nArtificial intelligence-based screening is a feasible solution for breast health in low-income, low health access areas like urban slums. Engagement of the local community and active involvement of the health system is of paramount importance for the sustainability of any novel strategy.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that COVID-19 is no longer a global pandemic due to development and integration of different technologies for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, technological advancement in the field of molecular biology, electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, nanotechnology, etc. has led to the development of molecular approaches and computer aided diagnosis for the detection of COVID-19. This study provides a holistic approach on COVID-19 detection based on (1) molecular diagnosis which includes RT-PCR, antigen-antibody, and CRISPR-based biosensors and (2) computer aided detection based on AI-driven models which include deep learning and transfer learning approach. The review also provide comparison between these two emerging technologies and open research issues for the development of smart-IoMT-enabled platforms for the detection of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "In this work, a new hydroelectric basin modelling approach is described and applied to the Pontecosi basin, Italy. Several types of data sources were used to learn the model: a number of weather stations, satellite observations, the reanalysis dataset, and basin data. With the goal of predicting the water level of the basin, the model was composed by three cascade modules. Firstly, different spatial interpolation methods, such as Kriging, Radial Basis Function, and Natural Neighbours, were compared and applied to interpolate the weather stations data nearby the basin area to infer the main environmental variables (air temperature, air humidity, precipitation, and wind speed) in the basin area. Then, using these variables as inputs, a neural network was trained to predict the mean soil moisture concentration over the area, also to improve the low availability due to satellite orbits. Finally, a non-linear auto regressive exogenous input (NARX) model was trained to simulate the basin level with different prediction horizons, using the data from the previous modules and past basin data (water level, discharge flow rate, and turbine flow rate). Accurate predictions of the basin water level were achieved within 1 to 6 h ahead, with mean absolute errors (MAE) between 2 cm and 10 cm, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Edge-based distributed intelligence techniques, such as federated learning (FL), have recently been used in many research fields thanks, in part, to their decentralized model training process and privacy-preserving features. However, because of the absence of effective deployment models for the radio access network (RAN), only a tiny number of FL apps have been created for the latest generation of public mobile networks (e.g., 5G and 6G). There is an attempt, in new RAN paradigms, to move toward disaggregation, hierarchical, and distributed network function processing designs. Open RAN (O-RAN), as a cutting-edge RAN technology, claims to meet 5G services with high quality. It includes integrated, intelligent controllers to provide RAN with the power to make smart decisions. This paper proposes a methodology for deploying and optimizing FL tasks in O-RAN to deliver distributed intelligence for 5G applications. To accomplish model training in each round, we first present reinforcement learning (RL) for client selection for each FL task and resource allocation using RAN intelligence controllers (RIC). Then, a slice is allotted for training depending on the clients chosen for the task. Our simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-art FL methods, such as the federated averaging algorithm (FedAvg), in terms of convergence and number of communication rounds.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of death among infectious diseases worldwide. Early screening and diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is crucial in TB control, and tend to benefit from artificial intelligence. Here, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of a variety of artificial intelligence methods in medical imaging for PTB. We searched MEDLINE and Embase with the OVID platform to identify trials published update to November 2022 that evaluated the effectiveness of artificial-intelligence-based software in medical imaging of patients with PTB. After data extraction, the quality of studies was assessed using quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2). Pooled sensitivity and specificity were estimated using a bivariate random-effects model. In total, 3987 references were initially identified and 61 studies were finally included, covering a wide range of 124,959 individuals. The pooled sensitivity and the specificity were 91% (95% confidence interval (CI), 89-93%) and 65% (54-75%), respectively, in clinical trials, and 94% (89-96%) and 95% (91-97%), respectively, in model-development studies. These findings have demonstrated that artificial-intelligence-based software could serve as an accurate tool to diagnose PTB in medical imaging. However, standardized reporting guidance regarding AI-specific trials and multicenter clinical trials is urgently needed to truly transform this cutting-edge technology into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The clinical course of acute pancreatitis (AP) can be variable depending on the severity of the disease, and it is crucial to predict the probability of organ failure to initiate early adequate treatment and management. Therefore, possible high-risk patients should be admitted to a high-dependence unit. For risk assessment, we have three options: (1) There are univariate biochemical markers for predicting severe AP. One of their main characteristics is that the absence or excess of these factors affects the outcome of AP in a dose-dependent manner. Unfortunately, all of these parameters have low accuracy; therefore, they cannot be used in clinical settings. (2) Score systems have been developed to prognosticate severity by using 4-25 factors. They usually require multiple parameters that are not measured on a daily basis, and they often require more than 24 h for completion, resulting in the loss of valuable time. However, these scores can foresee specific organ failure or severity, but they only use dichotomous parameters, resulting in information loss. Therefore, their use in clinical settings is limited. (3) Artificial intelligence can detect the complex nonlinear relationships between multiple biochemical parameters and disease outcomes. We have recently developed the very first easy-to-use tool, EASY-APP, which uses multiple continuous variables that are available at the time of admission. The web-based application does not require all of the parameters for prediction, allowing early and easy use on admission. In the future, prognostic scores should be developed with the help of artificial intelligence to avoid information loss and to provide a more individualized risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "Logistic regression (LR) and artificial intelligence algorithms were used to analyze the risk factors for the early rupture of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). Data from electronic medical records of 200 patients diagnosed with ATAAD from the Department of Emergency of Guangdong Provincial People\u2019s Hospital from April 2012 to March 2017 were collected. Logistic regression and artificial intelligence algorithms were used to establish prediction models, and the prediction effects of four models were analyzed. According to the LR models, we elucidated independent risk factors for ATAAD rupture, which included age > 63 years (odds ratio (OR) = 1.69), female sex (OR = 1.77), ventilator assisted ventilation (OR = 3.05), AST > 80 U/L (OR = 1.59), no distortion of the inner membrane (OR = 1.57), the diameter of the aortic sinus > 41 mm (OR = 0.92), maximum aortic diameter > 48 mm (OR = 1.32), the ratio of false lumen area to true lumen area > 2.12 (OR = 1.94), lactates > 1.9 mmol/L (OR = 2.28), and white blood cell > 14.2 \u00d7 109 /L (OR = 1.23). The highest sensitivity and accuracy were found with the convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Its sensitivity was 0.93, specificity was 0.90, and accuracy was 0.90. In this present study, we found that age, sex, select biomarkers, and select morphological parameters of the aorta are independent predictors for the rupture of ATAAD. In terms of predicting the risk of ATAAD, the performance of random forests and CNN is significantly better than LR, but the performance of the support vector machine (SVM) is worse than LR.",

    "abstract": "(1) Background: Increased stress and study overload during adolescence could be related to academic burnout. Anxiety sensitivity of students seems to affect burnout levels, while emotional intelligence enables emotion management under stressful conditions. The objective of this study is to analyze the roles of anxiety sensitivity and emotional intelligence in academic burnout. (2) Methods: In this quantitative cross-sectional study conducted in Spain, the sample comprised 1287 high school students aged 14 to 18 who filled out the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey, the Spanish version adapted for high school students of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3, and Brief Emotional Intelligence Inventory. (3) Results: Anxiety sensitivity was significantly higher in cynicism and emotional exhaustion. Furthermore, the mediation analysis showed that high anxiety sensitivity directly affected student exhaustion, cynicism, and efficacy levels. These effects were mediated mainly through stress management but also through the effect of stress management on mood, both emotional intelligence factors. (4) Conclusions: The academic changes that occur during high school hinder engagement and performance. Promoting the development of emotional skills would enable young people to manage their emotions when they become overwhelming and diminish their lack of interest and exhaustion in the classroom.",

    "abstract": "It is necessary to motivate university students to reduce the dropout rate in Spain, and to look for strategies that help university students acquire professional competencies; this is where gamification can be useful. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the influence of a learning methodology based on gamification and cooperative work in peers, and in mixed and interdisciplinary teams on the emotional intelligence, learning strategies, and life goals that motivate university students to learn. The sample consisted of 102 students who took a subject with a gamification-based methodology, through the Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics model, in a cooperative way. The Self-Perception Scale of Personal Academic Motivation and the Trait Meta Mood Scale 24 were used. The results of the study showed an increase in learning strategies and life goals that motivated university students to study, as well as increases in emotional clarity and significantly in emotional repair. It was concluded that gamification is a positive tool for its ability to increase emotional intelligence, life goals, and learning strategies in university students' motivation to learn.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence and its subcategories of machine learning and deep learning are gaining increasing importance and attention in the context of sports research. This has also meant that the number of corresponding publications has become complex and unmanageably large in human terms. In the current state of the research field, there is a lack of bibliometric analysis, which would prove useful for obtaining insights into the large amounts of available literature. Therefore, the present work aims to identify important research issues, elucidate the conceptual structure of the research field, and unpack the evolutionary trends and the direction of hot topics regarding key themes in the research field of artificial intelligence in sports. Using the Scopus database, 1215 documents (reviews and articles) were selected. Bibliometric analysis was performed using VOSviewer and bibliometrix R package. The main findings are as follows: (a) the literature and research interest concerning AI and its subcategories is growing exponentially; (b) the top 20 most cited works comprise 32.52% of the total citations; (c) the top 10 journals are responsible for 28.64% of all published documents; (d) strong collaborative relationships are present, along with small, isolated collaboration networks of individual institutions; (e) the three most productive countries are China, the USA, and Germany; (f) different research themes can be characterized using author keywords with current trend topics, e.g., in the fields of biomechanics, injury prevention or prediction, new algorithms, and learning approaches. AI research activities in the fields of sports pedagogy, sports sociology, and sports economics seem to have played a subordinate role thus far. Overall, the findings of this study expand knowledge on the research situation as well as the development of research topics regarding the use of artificial intelligence in sports, and may guide researchers to identify currently relevant topics and gaps in the research.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of breast cancer metastasis has decreased over the years. However, 20-30% of patients with early breast cancer still die from metastases. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model to predict the risk of distant metastasis using 3T-MRI DCE sequences (Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced).\nA total of 157 breast cancer patients who underwent staging 3T-MRI examinations from January 2011 to July 2022 were retrospectively examined. Patient data, tumor histological and MRI characteristics, and clinical and imaging follow-up examinations of up to 7 years were collected. Of the 157 MRI examinations, 39/157 patients (40 lesions) had distant metastases, while 118/157 patients (120 lesions) were negative for distant metastases (control group). We analyzed the role of the Deep Learning technique using a single variable size bounding box (SVB) option and employed a Voxel Based (VB) NET CNN model. The CNN performance was evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC).\nThe VB-NET model obtained a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC of 52.50%, 80.51%, 73.42%, and 68.56%, respectively. A significant correlation was found between the risk of distant metastasis and tumor size, and the expression of PgR and HER2.\nWe demonstrated a currently insufficient ability of the Deep Learning approach in predicting a distant metastasis status in patients with BC using CNNs.",

    "abstract": "Brain-derived extracellular vesicles (BDEVs) are released from the central nervous system. Brain-related research and diagnostic techniques involving BDEVs have rapidly emerged as a means of diagnosing brain disorders because they are minimally invasive and enable repeatable measurements based on body fluids. However, EVs from various cells and organs are mixed in the blood, acting as potential obstacles for brain diagnostic systems using BDEVs. Therefore, it is important to screen appropriate brain EV markers to isolate BDEVs in blood. Here, we established a strategy for screening potential BDEV biomarkers. To collect various molecular data from the BDEVs, we propose that the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic system could be enhanced using machine learning and AI analysis. This BDEV-based diagnostic strategy could be used to diagnose various brain diseases and will help prevent disease through early diagnosis and early treatment.",

    "abstract": "As the advanced form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) will significantly increase the risks of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC. However, there is no non-invasive method to distinguish NASH from NAFLD so far. Additionally, liver biopsy remains the gold standard to diagnose NASH, which is not appropriate for routine screening. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) is under rapid development in many aspects of medicine. Additionally, the application of AI in clinical information may have the potential to diagnose NASH non-invasively. This review summarizes the latest research using AI, specifically machine learning, to facilitate the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of NAFLD. Additionally, according to our prior results, this work proposes future development in this area.",

    "abstract": "Oral cancer is considered one of the most common cancer types in several counties. Earlier-stage identification is essential for better prognosis, treatment, and survival. To enhance precision medicine, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and deep learning (DL) models can be developed for automated oral cancer classification to improve detection rate and decrease cancer-specific mortality. This article focuses on the design of an optimal Inception-Deep Convolution Neural Network for Oral Potentially Malignant Disorder Detection (OIDCNN-OPMDD) technique in the IoMT environment. The presented OIDCNN-OPMDD technique mainly concentrates on identifying and classifying oral cancer by using an IoMT device-based data collection process. In this study, the feature extraction and classification process are performed using the IDCNN model, which integrates the Inception module with DCNN. To enhance the classification performance of the IDCNN model, the moth flame optimization (MFO) technique can be employed. The experimental results of the OIDCNN-OPMDD technique are investigated, and the results are inspected under specific measures. The experimental outcome pointed out the enhanced performance of the OIDCNN-OPMDD model over other DL models.",

    "abstract": "Background: The concept of addiction in relation to cellphone and smartphone use is not new, with several researchers already having explored this phenomenon. Artificial intelligence has become important in the rapid development of the technology field in recent years. It has a very positive impact on our day-to-day life. Aim: To investigate the relationship between nursing students\u2019 addiction to smart devices and their perceptions of artificial intelligence. Methods: A cross-sectional design was applied. The data were collected from 697 nursing students over three months at the College of Nursing, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University. Results: The correlation test shows a significant correlation between smart device addiction and the artificial intelligence of the respondents (p-value < 0.05). In addition, the majority of the students, 72.7% (507), are moderately addicted to smartphones, 21.8% (152) are highly addicted, and only 5.5% (38) have a low addiction. Meanwhile, 83.6% (583) of them have high levels of perception of artificial intelligence and the rest, 16.4% (114), have a moderate level. Conclusions: The nursing students\u2019 perception of artificial intelligence varies significantly according to their level of addiction to smart device utilization.",

    "abstract": "In epidemiology, a risk factor is a variable associated with increased disease risk. Understanding the role of risk factors is significant for developing a strategy to improve global health. There is strong evidence that risk factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, previous cataract surgery, age, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, BMI, female gender, and focal hyper-pigmentation are independently associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Currently, in the literature, statistical techniques like logistic regression, multivariable logistic regression, etc., are being used to identify AMD risk factors by employing numerical/categorical data. However, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have not been used so far in the literature for identifying risk factors for AMD. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) based tools can anticipate when a person is at risk of developing chronic diseases like cancer, dementia, asthma, etc., in providing personalized care. AI-based techniques can employ numerical/categorical and/or image data thus resulting in multimodal data analysis, which provides the need for AI-based tools to be used for risk factor analysis in ophthalmology. This review summarizes the statistical techniques used to identify various risk factors and the higher benefits that AI techniques provide for AMD-related disease prediction. Additional studies are required to review different techniques for risk factor identification for other ophthalmic diseases like glaucoma, diabetic macular edema, retinopathy of prematurity, cataract, and diabetic retinopathy.",

    "abstract": "We compared diagnostic performances between radiologists with reference to clinical information and standalone artificial intelligence (AI) detection of breast cancer on digital mammography. This study included 392 women (average age: 57.3 \u00b1 12.1 years, range: 30\u221294 years) diagnosed with malignancy between January 2010 and June 2021 who underwent digital mammography prior to biopsy. Two radiologists assessed mammographic findings based on clinical symptoms and prior mammography. All mammographies were analyzed via AI. Breast cancer detection performance was compared between radiologists and AI based on how the lesion location was concordant between each analysis method (radiologists or AI) and pathological results. Kappa coefficient was used to measure the concordance between radiologists or AI analysis and pathology results. Binominal logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors influencing the concordance between radiologists\u2019 analysis and pathology results. Overall, the concordance was higher in radiologists\u2019 diagnosis than on AI analysis (kappa coefficient: 0.819 vs. 0.698). Impact of prior mammography (odds ratio (OR): 8.55, p < 0.001), clinical symptom (OR: 5.49, p < 0.001), and fatty breast density (OR: 5.18, p = 0.008) were important factors contributing to the concordance of lesion location between radiologists\u2019 diagnosis and pathology results.",

    "abstract": "Having several applications in medicine, and in ophthalmology in particular, artificial intelligence (AI) tools have been used to detect visual function deficits, thus playing a key role in diagnosing eye diseases and in predicting the evolution of these common and disabling diseases. AI tools, i.e., artificial neural networks (ANNs), are progressively involved in detecting and customized control of ophthalmic diseases. The studies that refer to the efficiency of AI in medicine and especially in ophthalmology were analyzed in this review.\nWe conducted a comprehensive review in order to collect all accounts published between 2015 and 2022 that refer to these applications of AI in medicine and especially in ophthalmology. Neural networks have a major role in establishing the demand to initiate preliminary anti-glaucoma therapy to stop the advance of the disease.\nDifferent surveys in the literature review show the remarkable benefit of these AI tools in ophthalmology in evaluating the visual field, optic nerve, and retinal nerve fiber layer, thus ensuring a higher precision in detecting advances in glaucoma and retinal shifts in diabetes. We thus identified 1762 applications of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology: review articles and research articles (301 pub med, 144 scopus, 445 web of science, 872 science direct). Of these, we analyzed 70 articles and review papers (diabetic retinopathy (N = 24), glaucoma (N = 24), DMLV (N = 15), other pathologies (N = 7)) after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nIn medicine, AI tools are used in surgery, radiology, gynecology, oncology, etc., in making a diagnosis, predicting the evolution of a disease, and assessing the prognosis in patients with oncological pathologies. In ophthalmology, AI potentially increases the patient's access to screening/clinical diagnosis and decreases healthcare costs, mainly when there is a high risk of disease or communities face financial shortages. AI/DL (deep learning) algorithms using both OCT and FO images will change image analysis techniques and methodologies. Optimizing these (combined) technologies will accelerate progress in this area.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) is a fundamental diagnostic tool in breast imaging. However, US remains an operator-dependent examination. Research into and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in breast US are increasing. The aim of this rapid review was to assess the current development of US-based artificial intelligence in the field of breast cancer.\nTwo investigators with experience in medical research performed literature searching and data extraction on PubMed. The studies included in this rapid review evaluated the role of artificial intelligence concerning BC diagnosis, prognosis, molecular subtypes of breast cancer, axillary lymph node status, and the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The mean values of sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were calculated for the main study categories with a meta-analytical approach.\nA total of 58 main studies, all published after 2017, were included. Only 9/58 studies were prospective (15.5%); 13/58 studies (22.4%) used an ML approach. The vast majority (77.6%) used DL systems. Most studies were conducted for the diagnosis or classification of BC (55.1%). At present, all the included studies showed that AI has excellent performance in breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment strategy.\nUS-based AI has great potential and research value in the field of breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. More prospective and multicenter studies are needed to assess the potential impact of AI in breast ultrasound.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have demonstrated the value of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in breast cancer diagnosis. The systematic review of AI applications in breast cancer diagnosis includes several studies that compare breast cancer diagnosis and AI. However, they lack systematization, and each study appears to be conducted uniquely. The purpose and contributions of this study are to offer elaborative knowledge on the applications of AI in the diagnosis of breast cancer through citation analysis in order to categorize the main area of specialization that attracts the attention of the academic community, as well as thematic issue analysis to identify the species being researched in each category. In this study, a total number of 17,900 studies addressing breast cancer and AI published between 2012 and 2022 were obtained from these databases: IEEE, Embase: Excerpta Medica Database Guide-Ovid, PubMed, Springer, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to the search; 36 studies were identified. The vast majority of AI applications used classification models for the prediction of breast cancer. Howbeit, accuracy (99%) has the highest number of performance metrics, followed by specificity (98%) and area under the curve (0.95). Additionally, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was the best model of choice in several studies. This study shows that the quantity and caliber of studies that use AI applications in breast cancer diagnosis will continue to rise annually. As a result, AI-based applications are viewed as a supplement to doctors' clinical reasoning, with the ultimate goal of providing quality healthcare that is both affordable and accessible to everyone worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) appears to be making important advances in the prediction and diagnosis of mental disorders. Researchers have used visual, acoustic, verbal, and physiological features to train models to predict or aid in the diagnosis, with some success. However, such systems are rarely applied in clinical practice, mainly because of the many challenges that currently exist. First, mental disorders such as depression are highly subjective, with complex symptoms, individual differences, and strong socio-cultural ties, meaning that their diagnosis requires comprehensive consideration. Second, there are many problems with the current samples, such as artificiality, poor ecological validity, small sample size, and mandatory category simplification. In addition, annotations may be too subjective to meet the requirements of professional clinicians. Moreover, multimodal information does not solve the current challenges, and within-group variations are greater than between-group characteristics, also posing significant challenges for recognition. In conclusion, current AI is still far from effectively recognizing mental disorders and cannot replace clinicians' diagnoses in the near future. The real challenge for AI-based mental disorder diagnosis is not a technical one, nor is it wholly about data, but rather our overall understanding of mental disorders in general.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the success of artificial intelligence for early prediction of severe course, survival, and intensive care unit(ICU) requirement in patients with acute pancreatitis(AP).\nRetrospectively, 1334 patients were included the study. Severity is determined according to the Revised Atlanta Classification(RAC). The success of machine learning(ML) method was evaluated by 13 simple demographic, clinical, etiologic, and laboratory features obtained on ER admission. Additionally, it was evaluated whether Balthazar-computerized tomography severity index(CTSI) at 48-h contributed to success. The dataset was split into two parts, 90% for ML(of which 70% for learning and 30% for testing) and 10% for validation and 5-fold stratified sampling has been utilized. Variable Importance was used in the selection of features during training phase of machine. The Gradient Boost Algorithm trained the machine by KNIME analytics platform. SMOTE has been applied to increase the minority classes for training. The combined effects of the measured features were examined by multivariate logistic regression analysis and reciever operating curve curves of the prediction and confidence of the target variables were obtained.\nAccuracy values for the early estimation of Atlanta severity score, ICU requirement, and survival were found as 88.20%, 98.25%, and 92.77% respectively. When Balthazar-CTSI score is used, results were found as 91.02%, 92.25%, and 98% respectively.\nThe ML method we used successfully predicted the severe course, ICU requirement and survival, with promising accuracy values of over 88%. If 48-h Balthazar-CTSI is included in the calculation, the severity score and survival rates increase even more.",

    "abstract": "An intelligence information system (IIS) is a particular kind of information systems (IS) devoted to the analysis of intelligence relevant to national security. Professional and military intelligence analysts play a key role in this, but their judgments can be inconsistent, mainly due to noise and bias. The team-oriented aspects of the intelligence analysis process complicates the situation further. To enable analysts to achieve better judgments, the authors designed, implemented, and validated an innovative IIS for analyzing UK Military Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) data. The developed tool, the Team Information Decision Engine (TIDE), relies on an innovative preference learning method along with an aggregation procedure that permits combining scores by individual analysts into aggregated scores. This paper reports on a series of validation trials in which the performance of individual and team-oriented analysts was accessed with respect to their effectiveness and efficiency. Results show that the use of the developed tool enhanced the effectiveness and efficiency of intelligence analysis process at both individual and team levels.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence-driven decision support systems (AI-DSS) have the potential to help physicians analyze data and facilitate the search for a correct diagnosis or suitable intervention. The potential of such systems is often emphasized. However, implementation in clinical practice deserves continuous attention. This article aims to shed light on the needs and challenges arising from the use of AI-DSS from physicians' perspectives.\nThe basis for this study is a qualitative content analysis of expert interviews with experienced nephrologists after testing an AI-DSS in a straightforward usage scenario.\nThe results provide insights on the basics of clinical decision-making, expected challenges when using AI-DSS as well as a reflection on the test run.\nWhile we can confirm the somewhat expectable demand for better explainability and control, other insights highlight the need to uphold classical strengths of the medical profession when using AI-DSS as well as the importance of broadening the view of AI-related challenges to the clinical environment, especially during treatment. Our results stress the necessity for adjusting AI-DSS to shared decision-making. We conclude that explainability must be context-specific while fostering meaningful interaction with the systems available.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid development of computer technology, continual optimization of various learning algorithms and architectures, and establishment of numerous large databases, artificial intelligence (AI) has been unprecedentedly developed and applied in the field of ophthalmology. In the past, ophthalmological AI research mainly focused on posterior segment diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusion, and glaucoma optic neuropathy. Meanwhile, an increasing number of studies have employed AI to diagnose ocular surface diseases. In this review, we summarize the research progress of AI in the diagnosis of several ocular surface diseases, namely keratitis, keratoconus, dry eye, and pterygium. We discuss the limitations and challenges of AI in the diagnosis of ocular surface diseases, as well as prospects for the future.",

    "abstract": "A pterygium is a common ocular surface disease, which not only affects facial appearance but can also grow into the tissue layer, causing astigmatism and vision loss. In this study, an artificial intelligence model was developed for detecting the pterygium that requires surgical treatment. The model was designed using ensemble deep learning (DL).\nA total of 172 anterior segment images of pterygia were obtained from the Jiangxi Provincial People's Hospital (China) between 2017 and 2022. They were divided by a senior ophthalmologist into the non-surgery group and the surgery group. An artificial intelligence model was then developed based on ensemble DL, which was integrated with four benchmark models: the Resnet18, Alexnet, Googlenet, and Vgg11 model, for detecting the pterygium that requires surgical treatment, and Grad-CAM was used to visualize the DL process. Finally, the performance of the ensemble DL model was compared with the classical Resnet18 model, Alexnet model, Googlenet model, and Vgg11 model.\nThe accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) of the ensemble DL model was higher than all of the other models. In the training set, the accuracy and AUC of the ensemble model was 94.20% and 0.978, respectively. In the testing set, the accuracy and AUC of the ensemble model was 94.12% and 0.980, respectively.\nThis study indicates that this ensemble DL model, coupled with the anterior segment images in our study, might be an automated and cost-saving alternative for detection of the pterygia that require surgery.",

    "abstract": "Theorists have constructed emotional intelligence differently, based on which the literature reveals different diversified scales to measure emotional intelligence. These scales are quite lengthy to respond and have been criticized for producing varying results. The current paper projects the findings of 3 consecutive studies carried out to summarize and simplify the existing models of emotional intelligence and to produce a brief measure in this regard.\nBased on the review of the earlier models of emotional intelligence, emotional intelligence was comprehended as an \"ability to express and regulate emotions for intrinsic and extrinsic emotional satisfaction\". \"Emotional Intelligence Scale (EIS)\", comprising 12 items in English, was developed and validated through principal component analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis through a series of 3 consecutive studies which involved 1894 participants from Pakistan. The validity of EIS was tested step by step for its face, content, factorial, convergent, and discriminant validity. The reliability was measured through internal consistency and item-total and item-scale correlations.\nEIS was revealed to be a valid and reliable scale to measure emotional intelligence through 4 core factors, ie, emotional expression, emotional regulation, intrinsic emotional satisfaction, and extrinsic emotional satisfaction. The additional findings revealed significantly higher levels of emotional intelligence among men as compared to women; significantly positive correlation of emotional intelligence with social intelligence, positive emotional effects, age, and education; and a significantly inverse correlation between emotional intelligence and the negative emotional effects.\nThe current paper reported the development and validation of a new scale on emotional intelligence by comprehending and summarizing the earlier models of emotional intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being used to augment histopathological diagnostics in pathology. This systematic review aims to evaluate the evolution of these AI-based diagnostic techniques for diagnosing head and neck neoplasms.\nArticles regarding the use of AI for head and neck pathology published from 1982 until March 2022 were evaluated based on a search strategy determined by a multidisciplinary team of pathologists and otolaryngologists. Data from eligible articles were summarized according to author, year of publication, country, study population, tumor details, study results, and limitations.\nThirteen articles were included according to inclusion criteria. The selected studies were published between 2012 and March 1, 2022. Most of these studies concern the diagnosis of oral cancer; in particular, 6 are related to the oral cavity, 2 to the larynx, 1 to the salivary glands, and 4 to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS). As for the type of diagnostics considered, 12 concerned histopathology and 1 cytology.\nStarting from the pathological examination, artificial intelligence tools are an excellent solution for implementing diagnosis capability. Nevertheless, today the unavailability of large training datasets is a main issue that needs to be overcome to realize the true potential.",

    "abstract": "Couple relationship satisfaction is an important predictor of physical and mental health. Despite this, currently offered interventions for distressed couples are not always effective. The present cross-sectional online survey design examined how yoga practice, mindfulness, and emotional intelligence interrelate when predicting relationship satisfaction. The study consisted of 128 heterosexual married or cohabiting Australian adults (mean age 29.7 \u00b1 9.3) who practice yoga. Supporting the hypothesis, a serial mediation analysis revealed that time spent practicing yoga had a positive influence on relationship satisfaction through mindfulness, and then through emotional intelligence (b = 0.005, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.009). The findings also showed a direct effect of time spent practicing yoga on relationship satisfaction; however, there was no support for the individual mediating effects of mindfulness and emotional intelligence on the association between time spent practicing yoga and relationship satisfaction. The current findings suggest that yoga may be an effective and easily implemented approach to improving mindfulness and enhancing emotional intelligence, as well as heterosexual couples' relationship satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) are currently being funneled through legacy regulatory processes that are not adapted to the unique particularities of this new technology class. In the absence of adequate regulation of DHTs, the briefing of a patient by their healthcare provider (HCP) as a component of informed consent can present the last line of defense before potentially harmful technologies are employed on a patient.\nThis exploratory study utilizes a case vignette of a machine learning-based technology for the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease that is presented to a group of medical students, physicians, and bioethicists. What constitutes the necessary standard and content of the HCP-patient briefings is explored using a survey (\nWe find that participants deem artificial intelligence use in medical context should be declared to patients and argue that the explanation should currently follow the standard required of other experimental procedures. Further, since our study provides indications that implementation of HCP-patient briefings lacks behind the identified standard, opportunities for incorporation of training on the use of DHTs into medical curricula and continuous training schedules should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer screening (LCS) using low-dose CT has been demonstrated to reduce lung cancer-related mortality in large randomised controlled trials. Moving from trials to practice requires answering practical questions about the level of expertise of CT readers, the need for double reading as in trials and the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI). In addition, most LCS studies have predominantly included male participants with women being under-represented, even though the benefit of screening is greater for them. Thus, this study aims to compare the performance of a single CT reading by general radiologists trained in LCS using AI as a second reader to that of a double reading by expert thoracic radiologists, in a campaign for low-dose CT screening in high-risk women.\nThis observational cohort study will recruit 2400 asymptomatic women aged between 50 and 74 years, current or former smokers with at least a 20 pack-year smoking history, in 4 different French district areas. Assistance with smoking cessation will be offered to current smokers. An initial low-dose CT scan will be performed, with subsequent follow-ups at 1\u2009year and 2 years. The primary objective is to compare CT scan readings by a single LCS-trained, AI-assisted radiologist to that of an expert double reading. The secondary objectives are: to evaluate the performance of AI as a stand-alone reader; the adherence to screening of female participants; the influence on smoking cessation; the psychological consequences of screening; the detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease and osteoporosis on low-dose CT scans and the costs incurred by screening.\nEthics approval was obtained from the Comit\u00e9 de Protection des Personnes Sud-Est 1 (ethics approval number: 2021-A02265-36 with an amendment on 15 July 2022). Trial results will be disseminated at conferences, through relevant patient groups and published in peer-reviewed journals.\nNCT05195385.",

    "abstract": "Given the increasingly significant role of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the global economy and the ever more competitive markets in which these companies operate, SMEs' ability to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is of utmost importance. Due to constantly evolving social, environmental, and technological scenarios, the managers of these firms must increasingly focus on incorporating new tools such as AI into SME operations in order to enjoy their benefits. However, the subjectivity and complexity of this adaptation process makes integrated analyses of key factors challenging. The present study sought to develop a multi-criteria decision-support system that applies cognitive mapping and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory technique in a neutrosophic context. The main objective is to overcome the limitations of previous studies and models by structuring the decision problem and identifying and understanding which factors should be central to adaptation initiative analyses. A panel of experts in AI were recruited to facilitate the construction of an analysis system that takes into account indeterminacy in decision-making processes. The results were validated by both the panel members and project managers at COTEC Portugal-a leading think-and-action network that seeks to advance technology diffusion and business innovation cooperation. The proposed system's practical implications and benefits are also analyzed.",

    "abstract": "With biotechnological advancements, innovative omics technologies are constantly emerging that have enabled researchers to access multi-layer information from the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and more. A wealth of omics technologies, including bulk and single-cell omics approaches, have empowered to characterize different molecular layers at unprecedented scale and resolution, providing a holistic view of tumor behavior. Multi-omics analysis allows systematic interrogation of various molecular information at each biological layer while posing tricky challenges regarding how to extract valuable insights from the exponentially increasing amount of multi-omics data. Therefore, efficient algorithms are needed to reduce the dimensionality of the data while simultaneously dissecting the mysteries behind the complex biological processes of cancer. Artificial intelligence has demonstrated the ability to analyze complementary multi-modal data streams within the oncology realm. The coincident development of multi-omics technologies and artificial intelligence algorithms has fuelled the development of cancer precision medicine. Here, we present state-of-the-art omics technologies and outline a roadmap of multi-omics integration analysis using an artificial intelligence strategy. The advances made using artificial intelligence-based multi-omics approaches are described, especially concerning early cancer screening, diagnosis, response assessment, and prognosis prediction. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced in multi-omics analysis, along with tentative future trends in this field. With the increasing application of artificial intelligence in multi-omics analysis, we anticipate a shifting paradigm in precision medicine becoming driven by artificial intelligence-based multi-omics technologies.",

    "abstract": "Spine trauma, vertebral metastases, and osteoporosis (SVO) can result in serious health problems. If the diagnosis of SVO is delayed, the prognosis may be deteriorated. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is an essential method for minimizing the diagnostic errors associated with SVO. research achievements (RAs) of SVO on AI are required as a result of the greatest number of studies on AI solutions reported. The study aimed to: classify article themes using visualizations, illustrate the characteristics of SVO on AI recently, compare RAs of SVO on AI between entities (e.g., countries, institutes, departments, and authors), and determine whether the mean citations of keywords can be used to predict article citations.\nA total of 31 articles from SVO on AI (denoted by T31SVOAI) have been found in Web of Science since 2018. The dominant entities were analyzed using the CJAL score and the Y-index. Five visualizations were applied to report: the themes of T31SVOAI and their RAs in comparison for article entities and verification of the hypothesis that the mean citations of keywords can predict article citations, including: network diagrams, chord diagrams, dot plots, a Kano diagram, and radar plots.\nThere were five themes classified (osteoporosis, personalized medicine, fracture, deformity, and cervical spine) by a chord diagram. The dominant entities with the highest CJAL scores were the United States (22.05), the University of Pennsylvania (5.72), Radiology (6.12), and Nithin Kolanu (Australia) (9.88). The majority of articles were published in Bone, J. Bone Miner. Res., and Arch. Osteoporos., with an equal count (=3). There was a significant correlation between the number of article citations and the number of weighted keywords (F\u2005=\u2005392.05; P\u2005<\u2005.0001).\nA breakthrough was achieved by displaying the characteristics of T31SVOAI using the CJAL score, the Y-index, and the chord diagram. Weighted keywords can be used to predict article citations. The five visualizations employed in this study may be used in future bibliographical studies.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an integral role in enhancing the quality of surgical simulation, which is increasingly becoming a popular tool for enriching the training experience of a surgeon. This spans the spectrum from facilitating preoperative planning, to intraoperative visualisation and guidance, ultimately with the aim of improving patient safety. Although arguably still in its early stages of widespread clinical application, AI technology enables personal evaluation and provides personalised feedback in surgical training simulations. Several forms of surgical visualisation technologies currently in use for anatomical education and presurgical assessment rely on different AI algorithms. However, while it is promising to see clinical examples and technological reports attesting to the efficacy of AI-supported surgical simulators, barriers to wide-spread commercialisation of such devices and software remain complex and multifactorial. High implementation and production costs, scarcity of reports evidencing the superiority of such technology, and intrinsic technological limitations remain at the forefront. As AI technology is key to driving the future of surgical simulation, this paper will review the literature delineating its current state, challenges, and prospects. In addition, a consolidated list of FDA/CE approved AI-powered medical devices for surgical simulation is presented, in order to shed light on the existing gap between academic achievements and the universal commercialisation of AI-enabled simulators. We call for further clinical assessment of AI-supported surgical simulators to support novel regulatory body approved devices and usher surgery into a new era of surgical education.",

    "abstract": "The practice of medicine is rapidly transforming as a result of technological breakthroughs. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are becoming more and more relevant in medicine and orthopaedic surgery as a result of the nearly exponential growth in computer processing power, cloud based computing, and development, and refining of medical-task specific software algorithms. Because of the extensive role of technologies such as medical imaging that bring high sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative prognostic value to management of orthopaedic disorders, the field is particularly ripe for the application of machine-based integration of imaging studies, among other applications. Through this review, we seek to promote awareness in the orthopaedics community of the current accomplishments and projected uses of AI and ML as described in the literature. We summarize the current state of the art in the use of ML and AI in five key orthopaedic disciplines: joint reconstruction, spine, orthopaedic oncology, trauma, and sports medicine.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is here to stay and will change health care as we know it. The availability of big data and the increasing numbers of AI algorithms approved by the US Food and Drug Administration together will help in improving the quality of care for patients and in overcoming human fatigue barriers. In oncology practice, patients and providers rely on the interpretation of radiologists when making clinical decisions; however, there is considerable variability among readers, and in particular for prostate imaging. AI represents an emerging solution to this problem, for which it can provide a much-needed form of standardization. The diagnostic performance of AI alone in comparison to a combination of an AI framework and radiologist assessment for evaluation of prostate imaging has yet to be explored. Here, we compare the performance of radiologists alone versus a combination of radiologists aided by a modern computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) AI system. We show that the radiologist-CAD combination demonstrates superior sensitivity and specificity in comparison to both radiologists alone and AI alone. Our findings demonstrate that a radiologist\u00a0+\u00a0AI combination could perform best for detection of prostate cancer lesions. A hybrid technology-human system could leverage the benefits of AI in improving radiologist performance while also reducing physician workload, minimizing burnout, and enhancing the quality of patient care.\nOur report demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) for improving the interpretation of prostate scans. A combination of AI and evaluation by a radiologist has the best performance in determining the severity of prostate cancer. A hybrid system that uses both AI and radiologists could maximize the quality of care for patients while reducing physician workload and burnout.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an automated and noninvasive technique to discriminate COVID-19 patients from pneumonia patients using chest X-ray images and artificial intelligence. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is commonly administered to detect COVID-19. However, the RT-PCR test necessitates person-to-person contact to administer, requires variable time to produce results, and is expensive. Moreover, this test is still unreachable to the significant global population. The chest X-ray images can play an important role here as the X-ray machines are commonly available at any healthcare facility. However, the chest X-ray images of COVID-19 and viral pneumonia patients are very similar and often lead to misdiagnosis subjectively. This investigation has employed two algorithms to solve this problem objectively. One algorithm uses lower-dimension encoded features extracted from the X-ray images and applies them to the machine learning algorithms for final classification. The other algorithm relies on the inbuilt feature extractor network to extract features from the X-ray images and classifies them with a pretrained deep neural network VGG16. The simulation results show that the proposed two algorithms can extricate COVID-19 patients from pneumonia with the best accuracy of 100% and 98.1%, employing VGG16 and the machine learning algorithm, respectively. The performances of these two algorithms have also been collated with those of other existing state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is common in people living with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). However, there is little published data on intelligence quotient (IQ) in NMOSD patients. Therefore, we performed the present study to compare IQ scores across NMOSD, MS, and control groups.\nIn this cross-sectional study, 49 NMOSD (30 with positive aquaporin4 antibody), 41 MS, and 20 control individuals were recruited. The IQ score for each person was measured using Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R). Participants were reported on eleven scores of subsets, verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ), and full score IQ (FSIQ).\nThe scores of FSIQ, VIQ, PIQ, vocabulary, similarities, and digit-symbol in NMOSD and MS individuals were lower than the control group. Relative to control, NMOSD patients reported a lower score of information. We found no difference between NMOSD and MS groups, except in vocabulary and similarities. No significant difference between seropositive and seronegative NMOSD groups was observed except for the information and block design. In NMOSD group, a greater EDSS score was associated with decreased scores of FSIQ, VIQ, and PIQ. Being employed and being married were associated with greater scores of VIQ and PIQ, respectively. In both NMOSD and MS groups, advanced education was associated with increased scores of FSIQ and VIQ.\nOur study showed decreased IQ scores in NMOSD and MS. Further studies are required to examine intellectual quotient in people with NMOSD and MS.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to develop a prediction model for intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients using artificial neural networks (ANN). We assessed 25 laboratory parameters at first from 248 consecutive adult COVID-19 patients for database creation, training, and development of ANN models. We developed a new alpha-index to assess association of each parameter with outcome. We used 166 records for training of computational simulations (training), 41 for documentation of computational simulations (validation), and 41 for reliability check of computational simulations (testing). The first five laboratory indices ranked by importance were Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, Lactate Dehydrogenase, Fibrinogen, Albumin, and D-Dimers. The best ANN based on these indices achieved accuracy 95.97%, precision 90.63%, sensitivity 93.55%. and F1-score 92.06%, verified in the validation cohort. Our preliminary findings reveal for the first time an ANN to predict ICU hospitalization accurately and early, using only 5 easily accessible laboratory indices.",

    "abstract": "Considering the 2030 United Nations intent of world connection, Cyber Intelligence becomes the main area of the human dimension able of inflicting changes in geopolitical dynamics. In cyberspace, the new battlefield is the mind of people including new weapons like abuse of social media with information manipulation, deception by activists and misinformation. In this paper, a Sentiment Analysis system with Anomaly Detection (SAAD) capability is proposed. The system, scalable and modular, uses an OSINT-Deep Learning approach to investigate on social media sentiment in order to predict suspicious anomaly trend in Twitter posts. Anomaly detection is investigated with a new semi-supervised process that is able to detect potentially dangerous situations in critical areas. The main contributions of the paper are the system suitability for working in different areas and domains, the anomaly detection procedure in sentiment context and a time-dependent confusion matrix to address model evaluation with unbalanced dataset. Real experiments and tests were performed on Sahel Region. The detected anomalies in negative sentiment have been checked by experts of Sahel area, proving true links between the models results and real situations observable from the tweets.",

    "abstract": "Reduced audit quality behavior is widespread in the auditor's practice and is an important factor threatening audit quality. Some prior studies have investigated the relationship between auditors' psychological contract violation and reduced audit quality behavior. However, the research of relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and auditors' behavior is still in its infancy despite the fact that the auditing profession would benefit greatly from improving audit team's EI. This study examines whether and why the audit team's EI restrains the audit quality reduction behavior in audit firms. In the study, our hypotheses are tested using a data set collected from 326 respondents in Chinese audit firms. The results are as follows: firstly, audit team's EI is directly negatively related to reduced audit quality behavior. Secondly, EI is indirectly related to reduced audit quality behavior, through team trust. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) indicate a mediation model where team trust is negatively related to reduced audit quality behavior. Thirdly, knowledge sharing is a significant mechanism that moderates the effects of different types of EI on audit quality reduction behavior. In the audit team with high knowledge sharing, the audit team's EI can refrain the audit quality reduction behavior; In the audit team with low knowledge sharing, the audit team's EI has no significant effect on audit quality reduction behavior. This study expands the factors affecting audit quality to the psychological level of audit teams, enriches the literature on audit team's behavior characteristics, and provides direct evidence for the relationship between audit team's psychological characteristics and audit quality.",

    "abstract": "Researchers are studying how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to better detect, prognosticate and subgroup diseases. The idea that AI might advance medicine's understanding of biological categories of psychiatric disorders, as well as provide better treatments, is appealing given the historical challenges with prediction, diagnosis and treatment in psychiatry. Given the power of AI to analyse vast amounts of information, some clinicians may feel obligated to align their clinical judgements with the outputs of the AI system. However, a potential epistemic privileging of AI in clinical judgements may lead to unintended consequences that could negatively affect patient treatment, well-being and rights. The implications are also relevant to precision medicine, digital twin technologies and predictive analytics generally. We propose that a commitment to epistemic humility can help promote judicious clinical decision-making at the interface of big data and AI in psychiatry.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of endovascular procedures has revolutionized the management of complex aortic aneurysms. Although repair has traditionally required longer operative times and increased radiation exposure compared with simple endovascular aneurysm repair, the recent introduction of three-dimensional technology has become an invaluable operative adjunct. Surgical augmented intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving tool initiated at our institution in June 2019. In our study, we sought to determine whether this technology improved patient and operator safety.\nA retrospective review of patients who had undergone endovascular repair of complex aortic aneurysms (pararenal, juxtarenal, or thoracoabdominal), type B dissection, or infrarenal (endoleak, coil placement, or renal angiography with or without intervention) at a tertiary care center from August 2015 to November 2021 was performed. Patients were stratified according to the findings from intelligent maps, which are patient-specific AI tools used in the operating room in conjunction with real-time fluoroscopic images. The primary outcomes included operative time, radiation exposure, fluoroscopy time, and contrast use. The secondary outcomes included 30-day postoperative complications and long-term follow-up. Linear regression models were used to evaluate the association between AI use and the main outcomes.\nDuring the 6-year period, 116 patients were included in the present study, with no significant differences in the baseline characteristics. Of the 116 patients, 76 (65.5%) had undergone procedures using AI and 40 (34.5%) had undergone procedures without AI software. The intraoperative outcomes revealed a significant decrease in radiation exposure (AI group, 1955\u00a0mGy; vs non-AI group, 3755\u00a0mGy; P\u00a0= .004), a significant decrease in the fluoroscopy time (AI group, 55.6\u00a0minutes; vs non-AI group, 86.9\u00a0minutes; P\u00a0= .007), a decrease in the operative time (AI group, 255\u00a0minutes; vs non-AI group, 284\u00a0minutes; P\u00a0= .294), and a significant decrease in contrast use (AI group, 123\u00a0mL; vs non-AI group, 199\u00a0mL; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). No differences were found in the 30-day and long-term outcomes.\nThe results from the present study have demonstrated that the use of AI technology combined with intraoperative imaging can significantly facilitate complex endovascular aneurysm repair by decreasing the operative time, radiation exposure, fluoroscopy time, and contrast use. Overall, evolving technology such as AI has improved radiation safety for both the patient and the entire operating room team.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing worldwide. If detected early, melanoma is highly treatable, so early detection is vital.Skin cancer early detection has improved significantly in recent decades, for example by the introduction of screening in 2008 and dermoscopy. Nevertheless, in particular visual detection of early melanomas remains challenging because they show many morphological overlaps with nevi. Hence, there continues to be a high medical need to further develop methods for early skin cancer detection in order to be able to reliably diagnosemelanomas at a very early stage.Routine diagnostics for melanoma detection include visual whole body inspection, often supplemented by dermoscopy, which can significantly increase the diagnostic accuracy of experienced dermatologists. A procedure that is additionally offered in some practices and clinics is wholebody photography combined with digital dermoscopy for the early detection of malignant melanoma, especially for monitoring high-risk patients.In recent decades, numerous noninvasive adjunctive diagnostic techniques were developed for the examination of suspicious pigmented moles, that may have the potential to allow improved and, in some cases, automated evaluation of these lesions. First, confocal laser microscopy should be mentioned here, as well as electrical impedance spectroscopy, multiphoton laser tomography, multispectral analysis, Raman spectroscopy or optical coherence tomography. These diagnostic techniques usually focus on high sensitivity to avoid malignant melanoma being overlooked. However, this usually implies lower specificity, which may lead to unnecessary excision of benign lesions in screening. Also, some of the procedures are time-consuming and costly, which also limits their applicability in skin cancer screening. In the near future, the use of artificial intelligence might change skin cancer diagnostics in many ways. The most promising approach may be the analysis of routine macroscopic and dermoscopic images by artificial intelligence.For the classification of pigmented skin lesions based on macroscopic and dermoscopic images, artificial intelligence, especially in form of neural networks, has achieved comparable diagnostic accuracies to dermatologists under experimental conditions in numerous studies. In particular, it achieved high accuracies in the binary melanoma/nevus classification task, but it also performed comparably well to dermatologists in multiclass differentiation of various skin diseases. However, proof of the basic applicability and utility of such systems in clinical practice is still pending. Prerequisites that remain to be established to enable translation of such diagnostic systems into dermatological routine are means that allow users to comprehend the system's decisions as well as a uniformly high performance of the algorithms on image data from other hospitals and practices.At present, hints are accumulating that computer-aided diagnosis systems could provide their greatest benefit as assistance systems, since studies indicate that a combination of human and machine achieves the best results. Diagnostic systems based on artificial intelligence are capable of detecting morphological characteristics quickly, quantitatively, objectively and reproducibly, and could thus provide a more objective analytical basis - in addition to medical experience.\nWeltweit steigt die Inzidenz des malignen Melanoms an. Bei fr\u00fchzeitiger Erkennung ist das Melanom gut behandelbar, eine Fr\u00fcherkennung ist also lebenswichtig.Die Hautkrebs-Fr\u00fcherkennung hat sich in den letzten Jahrzehnten bspw. durch die Einf\u00fchrung des Screenings im Jahr 2008 und die Dermatoskopie deutlich verbessert. Dennoch bleibt die visuelle Erkennung insbesondere von fr\u00fchen Melanomen eine Herausforderung, weil diese viele morphologische \u00dcberlappungen mit N\u00e4vi zeigen. Daher ist der medizinische Bedarf weiterhin hoch, die Methoden zur Hautkrebsfr\u00fcherkennung gezielt weiterzuentwickeln, um Melanome bereits in einem sehr fr\u00fchen Stadium sicher diagnostizieren zu k\u00f6nnen.Die Routinediagnostik zur Hautkrebs-Fr\u00fcherkennung umfasst die visuelle Ganzk\u00f6rperinspektion, oft erg\u00e4nzt durch die Dermatoskopie, durch die sich die diagnostische Treffsicherheit erfahrener Haut\u00e4rzte deutlich erh\u00f6hen l\u00e4sst. Ein Verfahren, was in einigen Praxen und Kliniken zus\u00e4tzlich angeboten wird, ist die kombinierte Ganzk\u00f6rperfotografie mit der digitalen Dermatoskopie f\u00fcr die Fr\u00fcherkennung maligner Melanome, insbesondere f\u00fcr das Monitoring von Hochrisiko-Patienten.In den letzten Jahrzenten wurden zahlreiche nicht invasive zusatzdiagnostische Verfahren zur Beurteilung verd\u00e4chtiger Pigmentmale entwickelt, die das Potenzial haben k\u00f6nnten, eine verbesserte und z. T. automatisierte Bewertung dieser L\u00e4sionen zu erm\u00f6glichen. In erster Linie ist hier die konfokale Lasermikroskopie zu nennen, ebenso die elektrische Impedanzspektroskopie, die Multiphotonen-Lasertomografie, die Multispektralanalyse, die Raman-Spektroskopie oder die optische Koh\u00e4renztomografie. Diese diagnostischen Verfahren fokussieren i. d. R. auf hohe Sensitivit\u00e4t, um zu vermeiden, ein malignes Melanom zu \u00fcbersehen. Dies bedingt allerdings \u00fcblicherweise eine geringere Spezifit\u00e4t, was im Screening zu unn\u00f6tigen Exzisionen vieler gutartiger L\u00e4sionen f\u00fchren kann. Auch sind einige der Verfahren zeitaufwendig und kostenintensiv,was die Anwendbarkeit im Screening ebenfalls einschr\u00e4nkt.In naher Zukunft wird insbesondere die Nutzung von k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz die Diagnosefindung in vielf\u00e4ltiger Weise ver\u00e4ndern. Vielversprechend ist v. a. die Analyse der makroskopischen und dermatoskopischen Routine-Bilder durch k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz. F\u00fcr die Klassifizierung von pigmentierten Hautl\u00e4sionen anhand makroskopischer und dermatoskopischer Bilder erzielte die k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz v. a. in Form neuronaler Netze unter experimentellen Bedingungen in zahlreichen Studien bereits eine vergleichbare diagnostische Genauigkeit wie Dermatologen. Insbesondere bei der bin\u00e4ren Klassifikationsaufgabe Melanom/N\u00e4vus erreichte sie hohe Genauigkeiten, doch auch in der Multiklassen-Differenzierung von verschiedenen Hauterkrankungen zeigt sie sich vergleichbar gut wie Dermatologen. Der Nachweis der grunds\u00e4tzlichen Anwendbarkeit und des Nutzens solcher Systeme in der klinischen Praxis steht jedoch noch aus. Noch zu schaffende Grundvoraussetzungen f\u00fcr die Translation solcher Diagnosesysteme in die dermatologischen Routine sind M\u00f6glichkeiten f\u00fcr die Nutzer, die Entscheidungen des Systems nachzuvollziehen, sowie eine gleichbleibend gute Leistung der Algorithmen auf Bilddaten aus fremden Kliniken und Praxen.Derzeit zeichnet sich ab, dass computergest\u00fctzte Diagnosesysteme als Assistenzsysteme den gr\u00f6\u00dften Nutzen bringen k\u00f6nnten, denn Studien deuten darauf hin, dass eine Kombination von Mensch und Maschine die besten Ergebnisse erzielt. Diagnosesysteme basierend auf k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz sind in der Lage, Merkmale schnell, quantitativ, objektiv und reproduzierbar zu erfassen, und k\u00f6nnten somit die Medizin auf eine mathematische Grundlage stellen \u2013 zus\u00e4tzlich zur \u00e4rztlichen Erfahrung.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between spiritual well-being and spiritual intelligence with mental health in students.\nThis descriptive-analytical study was conducted among 277 students (110 boys and 167 girls) through convenience sampling. The data collection instruments in this study included a spiritual well-being questionnaire, King's spiritual intelligence questionnaire, and Goldberg's general health questionnaire. After being entered into SPSS statistical software, the data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical.\nThe results of multivariate regression analysis using the step-by-step method showed that spiritual well-being predicts 14% of the variance of students' mental health. Also, on the scale of spiritual well-being, the two dimensions of communication with oneself and communication with others were predictors for the social functioning dimension of mental health. Also, among the subscales of spiritual well-being, the subscale of connection with God had an inverse and significant relationship with anxiety and physical health (p<0.05), and an inverse and significant relationship were observed between the subscale of connection with self with anxiety and depression (p<0.05).\nThe results of the present study confirm that spiritual well-being and spiritual intelligence affect mental health and its dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Fluid intelligence is seen as a beneficial attribute, protecting against stress and ill-health. Whether intelligence provides resilience to the cognitive effects of insufficient sleep was tested in the current pre-registered experimental study. Participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0182) completed the Raven's test (measuring fluid intelligence) and a normal night of sleep or a night of total sleep deprivation. Sleepiness and four cognitive tests were completed at 22:30\u2009hours (baseline), and the following day after sleep manipulation. At baseline, higher fluid intelligence was associated with faster and more accurate arithmetic calculations, and better episodic memory, but not with spatial working memory, simple attention or sleepiness. Those with higher fluid intelligence were more, not less, impacted by sleep deprivation, evident for arithmetic ability, episodic memory\u00a0and spatial working memory. We need to establish a more nuanced picture of the benefits of intelligence, where intelligence is not related to cognitive advantages in all situations.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted the world since 2019, causing significant morbidity and mortality in developed and developing countries alike. Although substantial resources have been diverted to developing diagnostic, preventative, and treatment measures, disparities in the availability and efficacy of these tools vary across countries. We seek to assess the ability of commercial artificial intelligence (AI) technology to diagnose COVID-19 by analyzing chest radiographs.\nChest radiographs taken from symptomatic patients within two days of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were assessed for COVID-19 infection by board-certified radiologists and commercially available AI software. Sixty\u00a0patients with negative and 60 with positive COVID reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were chosen. Results were compared against results of the PCR test for accuracy and statistically analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves along with area under the curve (AUC) values.\nA total of 120 chest radiographs (60 positive and 60 negative RT-PCR tests) radiographs were analyzed. The AI software performed significantly better than chance (p = 0.001) and did not differ significantly from the radiologist ROC curve (p = 0.78).\nCommercially available AI software was not inferior compared with trained radiologists in accurately identifying COVID-19 cases by analyzing radiographs.

    "abstract": "While the organizational factors that account for firefighters' burnout have been extensively explored, the individual factors related to how they regulate interpersonal conflicts and emotions remain to be investigated. Previous research has demonstrated the association between emotional intelligence and conflict management styles and burnout, but no study has looked at the interrelationships among these factors in high-risk sectors. The present exploratory study aimed to fill this research gap by investigating the relationships between conflict management style, emotional intelligence and burnout in a sample of firefighters.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted with 240 French firefighters. Measures comprised validated scales of conflict management styles, emotional intelligence and burnout.\nResults showed that the integrating conflict style reduced burnout. They also revealed the effects of emotion regulation on burnout, whereby the awareness and management of one's own emotions reduced burnout. Moreover, awareness of one's own emotions moderated the relationship between integrating conflict resolution style and burnout, whereby the effect of integrating style on reduced burnout was higher when awareness of one's own emotions was high.\nThese results reveal that strategies used by firefighters to regulate their emotions in order to meet the emotional demands specific to their job are important for reducing the emotional exhaustion component of burnout. Training programs for conflict and emotion management are needed to preserve the mental health of firefighters and ensure the safety of interventions.",

    "abstract": "Foot ulcers are common complications of diabetes mellitus and substantially increase the morbidity and mortality due to this disease. Wound care by regular monitoring of the progress of healing with clinical review of the ulcers, dressing changes, appropriate antibiotic therapy for infection and proper offloading of the ulcer are the cornerstones of the management of foot ulcers. Assessing the progress of foot ulcers can be a challenge for the clinician and patient due to logistic issues such as regular attendance in the clinic. Foot clinics are often busy and because of manpower issues, ulcer reviews can be delayed with detrimental effects on the healing as a result of a lack of appropriate and timely changes in management. Wound photographs have been historically useful to assess the progress of diabetic foot ulcers over the past few decades. Mobile phones with digital cameras have recently revolutionized the capture of foot ulcer images. Patients can send ulcer photographs to diabetes care professionals electronically for remote monitoring, largely avoiding the logistics of patient transport to clinics with a reduction on clinic pressures. Artificial intelligence-based technologies have been developed in recent years to improve this remote monitoring of diabetic foot ulcers with the use of mobile apps. This is expected to make a huge impact on diabetic foot ulcer care with further research and development of more accurate and scientific technologies in future. This clinical update review aims to compile evidence on this hot topic to empower clinicians with the latest developments in the field.",

    "abstract": "In the field of computer science, known as artificial intelligence, algorithms imitate reasoning tasks that are typically performed by humans. The techniques that allow machines to learn and get better at tasks such as recognition and prediction, which form the basis of clinical practice, are referred to as machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. The number of artificial intelligence-and machine learnings-related publications in clinical journals has grown exponentially, driven by recent developments in computation and the accessibility of simple tools. However, clinicians are often not included in data science teams, which may limit the clinical relevance, explanability, workflow compatibility, and quality improvement of artificial intelligence solutions. Thus, this results in the language barrier between clinicians and artificial intelligence developers. Healthcare practitioners sometimes lack a basic understanding of artificial intelligence research because the approach is difficult for non-specialists to understand. Furthermore, many editors and reviewers of medical publications might not be familiar with the fundamental ideas behind these technologies, which may prevent journals from publishing high-quality artificial intelligence studies or, worse still, could allow for the publication of low-quality works. In this review, we aim to improve readers\u2019 artificial intelligence literacy and critical thinking. As a result, we concentrated on what we consider the 10 most important qualities of artificial intelligence research: valid scientific purpose, high-quality data set, robust reference standard, robust input, no information leakage, optimal bias-variance tradeoff, proper model evaluation, proven clinical utility, transparent reporting, and open science. Before designing a study, one should have defined a sound scientific purpose. Then, it should be backed by a high-quality data set, robust input, and a solid reference standard. The artificial intelligence development pipeline should prevent information leakage. For the models, optimal bias-variance tradeoff should be achieved, and generalizability assessment must be adequately performed. The clinical value of the final models must also be established. After the study, thought should be given to transparency in publishing the process and results as well as open science for sharing data, code, and models. We hope this work may improve the artificial intelligence literacy and mindset of the readers.",

    "abstract": "Industrial artificial intelligence (IAI) and other analysis tools with obfuscated internal processes are growing in capability and ubiquity within industrial settings. Decision-makers share their concern regarding the objective evaluation of such tools and their impacts at the system level, facility level, and beyond. One application where this style of tool is making a significant impact is in Condition Monitoring Systems (CMSs). This paper addresses the need to evaluate CMSs, a collection of software and devices that alert users to changing conditions within assets or systems of a facility. The presented evaluation procedure uses CMSs as a case study for a broader philosophy evaluating the impacts of IAI tools. CMSs can provide value to a system by forewarning faults, defects, or other unwanted events. However, evaluating CMS value through scenarios that did not occur is rarely easy or intuitive. Further complicating this evaluation are the ongoing investment costs and risks posed by the CMS from imperfect monitoring. To overcome this, an industrial facility needs to regularly and objectively review CMS impacts to justify investments and maintain competitive advantage. This paper's procedure assesses the suitability of a CMS for a system in terms of risk and investment analysis. This risk-based approach uses the changes in the likelihood of good and bad events to quantify CMS value without making any one-time point-wise estimates. Fictional case studies presented in this paper illustrate the procedure and demonstrate its usefulness and validity.",

However, it is still a question worth exploring about how emotional intelligence affects expatriate performance in international construction projects. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the relationship between expatriates' emotional intelligence and expatriate performance and explore the mediating role of self-efficacy and psychological resilience.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted in June 2021. A non-probability sampling method was used to obtain data. A total of 315 Chinese construction expatriates in 67 countries and regions around the world were evaluated using four scales: the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the Connor-Davidson Resilience scale, and the Kraimer's expatriate's performance scale. The hypothesis model was tested using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM).\nThe results of the data analysis indicated that self-efficacy (\u03b2\nThis study attempted to investigate the mechanism of emotional intelligence's influence on expatriate performance from the perspective of individual psychological resources.

    "abstract": "There is growing concern that artificial intelligence conversational agents (e.g., Siri, Alexa) reinforce voice-based social stereotypes. Because little is known about social perceptions of conversational agents' voices, we investigated (1) the dimensions that underpin perceptions of these synthetic voices and (2) the role that acoustic parameters play in these perceptions. Study 1 (N\u2009=\u2009504) found that perceptions of synthetic voices are underpinned by Valence and Dominance components similar to those previously reported for natural human stimuli and that the Dominance component was strongly and negatively related to voice pitch. Study 2 (N\u2009=\u2009160) found that experimentally manipulating pitch in synthetic voices directly influenced dominance-related, but not valence-related, perceptions. Collectively, these results suggest that greater consideration of the role that voice pitch plays in dominance-related perceptions when designing conversational agents may be an effective method for controlling stereotypic perceptions of their voices and the downstream consequences of those perceptions.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing survival of premature infants, there is an increased demand to provide adequate retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) services. Wide field retinal imaging (WFDRI) and artificial intelligence (AI) have shown promise in the field of ROP and have the potential to improve the diagnostic performance and reduce the workload for screening ophthalmologists. The aim of this review is to systematically review and provide a summary of the diagnostic characteristics of existing deep learning algorithms.\nTwo authors independently searched the literature, and studies using a deep learning system from retinal imaging were included. Data were extracted, assessed and reported using PRISMA guidelines.\nTwenty-seven studies were included in this review. Nineteen studies used AI systems to diagnose ROP, classify the staging of ROP, diagnose the presence of pre-plus or plus disease, or assess the quality of retinal images. The included studies reported a sensitivity of 71%-100%, specificity of 74-99% and area under the curve of 91-99% for the primary outcome of the study. AI techniques were comparable to the assessment of ophthalmologists in terms of overall accuracy and sensitivity. Eight studies evaluated vascular severity scores and were able to accurately differentiate severity using an automated classification score.\nArtificial intelligence for ROP diagnosis is a growing field, and many potential utilities have already been identified, including the presence of plus disease, staging of disease and a new automated severity score. AI has a role as an adjunct to clinical assessment; however, there is insufficient evidence to support its use as a sole diagnostic tool currently.",

    "abstract": "Classic design of experiment relies on a time-intensive workflow that requires planning, data interpretation, and hypothesis building by experienced researchers. Here, we describe an integrated, machine-intelligent experimental system which enables simultaneous dynamic tests of electrical, optical, gravimetric, and viscoelastic properties of materials under a programmable dynamic environment. Specially designed software controls the experiment and performs on-the-fly extensive data analysis and dynamic modeling, real-time iterative feedback for dynamic control of experimental conditions, and rapid visualization of experimental results. The system operates with minimal human intervention and enables time-efficient characterization of complex dynamic multifunctional environmental responses of materials with simultaneous data processing and analytics. The system provides a viable platform for artificial intelligence (AI)-centered material characterization, which, when coupled with an AI-controlled synthesis system, could lead to accelerated discovery of multifunctional materials.",

    "abstract": "Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is underdiagnosed and current screening is costly. We aimed: (a) to develop an expert system (ES) based on machine learning that calculates the risk of OD from the electronic health records (EHR) of all hospitalized older patients during admission, and (b) to implement the ES in a general hospital. In an observational, retrospective study, EHR and swallowing assessment using the volume-viscosity swallow test for OD were captured over 24\u00a0months in patients\u2009>\u200970\u00a0yr admitted to Matar\u00f3 Hospital. We studied the predictive power for OD of 25,000 variables. ES was obtained using feature selection, the final prediction model was built with non-linear methods (Random Forest). The database included 2809 older patients (mean age 82.47\u2009\u00b1\u20099.33\u00a0yr), severely dependent (Barthel Index 47.68\u2009\u00b1\u200931.90), with multiple readmissions (4.06\u2009\u00b1\u20097.52); 75.76% had OD. The psychometrics of the ES built with a non-linear model were: Area under the ROC Curve of 0.840; sensitivity 0.940; specificity, 0.416; Positive Predictive Value 0.834; Negative Predictive Value 0.690; positive likelihood ratio (LH), 1.61 and negative LH, 0.146. The ES screens in 6\u00a0s all patients admitted to a 419-bed hospital, identifies patients at greater risk of OD, and shows the risk for OD in the clinician's workstation. It is currently in use at our institution. Our ES provides accurate, systematic and universal screening for OD in real time during hospital admission of older patients, allowing the most appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to be selected for each patient.",

    "abstract": "The applicability and accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted bone age assessment and adult height prediction methods in girls with early puberty are unknown.\nTo analyze the performance of AI-assisted bone age assessment methods by comparing the corresponding methods for predicted adult height with actual adult height.\nThis retrospective review included 726 girls with early puberty, 87 of whom had reached adult height at last follow-up. Bone age was evaluated using the Greulich-Pyle (GP), Tanner-Whitehouse (TW3-RUS) and China 05 RUS-CHN (RUS-CHN) methods. Predicted adult height was calculated using the China 05 (CH05), TW3 and Bayley-Pinneau (BP) methods.\nWe analyzed 1,663 left-hand radiographs, including 155 from girls who had reached adult height. In the 6-8- and 9-11-years age groups, bone age differences were smaller than those in the 12-14-years group; however, the differences between predicted adult height and actual adult height were larger than those in the 12-14-years group. TW3 overestimated adult height by 0.4\u00b12.8\u00a0cm, while CH05 and BP significantly underestimated adult height by 2.9\u00b13.6\u00a0cm and 1.3\u00b13.8\u00a0cm, respectively. TW3 yielded the highest proportion of predicted adult height within \u00b15\u00a0cm of actual adult height (92.9%), with the highest correlation between predicted and actual adult heights.\nThe differences in measured bone ages increased with increasing bone age. However, the corresponding method for predicting adult height was more accurate when the bone age was older. TW3 might be more suitable than CH05 and BP for predicting adult height in girls with early puberty. Methods for predicting adult height should be optimized for populations of the same ethnicity and disease.",

    "abstract": "As miniaturized solutions, mid-infrared (MIR) waveguide sensors are promising for label-free compositional detection of mixtures leveraging plentiful absorption fingerprints. However, the quantitative analysis of liquid mixtures is still challenging using MIR waveguide sensors, as the absorption spectrum overlaps for multiple organic components accompanied by strong water absorption background. Here, we present an artificial-intelligence-enhanced metamaterial waveguide sensing platform (AIMWSP) for aqueous mixture analysis in the MIR. With the sensitivity-improved metamaterial waveguide and assistance of machine learning, the MIR absorption spectra of a ternary mixture in water can be successfully distinguished and decomposed to single-component spectra for predicting concentration. A classification accuracy of 98.88% for 64 mixing ratios and 92.86% for four concentrations below the limit of detection (972 ppm, based on 3\u03c3) with steps of 300 ppm are realized. Besides, the mixture concentration prediction with root-mean-squared error varying from 0.107 vol % to 1.436 vol % is also achieved. Our work indicates the potential of further extending this sensing platform to MIR spectrometer-on-chip aiming for the data analytics of multiple organic components in aqueous environments.",

    "abstract": "To develop an emotional intelligence (EI) test and evaluate its psychometrics for social and healthcare student selection.\nA cross-sectional methodological design.\nThe test was developed based on a systematic review and focus group interviews. Content validity was evaluated with expert panels, and preliminary psychometrics with two pilot studies. Descriptive statistics, correlations and item response theory were used.\nSearch was conducted in six databases 2018. Focus group interviews were conducted with educators and professionals in 2019. Expert panels with doctoral students, researchers and educators were conducted in 2020. Pilot tests with students were conducted 2020-2021. The developed test was administered to 4808 applicants 2021.\nThe test included four subscales. Correlations support the test's theoretical structure. The items were mainly easy.\nThe test assesses EI objectively and comprehensively. The item-level distractor analysis can be used for further test development.\nSocial care and healthcare students engage in clinical practice early in their studies, and these environments can be emotionally challenging. Assessing EI in student selection with adequate test can help the institutions of higher education to select the students with required abilities to succeed in the studies. The assessment of EI during student selection also provides information higher education institutions could use to develop and provide support interventions. The results may also encourage practice placements to include EI elements as learning objective. The results of this study and especially the use of IRT and detailed distractor analysis to evaluate the psychometric properties of EMI-T can benefit researchers and educators that develop or evaluate objective assessment tools with multiple choice questions.\nEmotional intelligence is important for students to enable professional interaction.",

    "abstract": "Investment theories have claimed reciprocal relations between intelligence and investment traits (i.e., personality traits related to seeking out, and dealing with, cognitive challenges). However, previous research has primarily addressed the effects of investment traits on intellectual development (environmental enrichment hypothesis) and often focused on either childhood or later adulthood. The present study investigated the effects of intelligence on investment traits (environmental success hypothesis) from mid to late adolescence.\nIn a 3-year longitudinal survey (2008-2011) covering four measurement occasions, the predictive effects of both fluid and crystallized intelligence on intraindividual change in both the achievement motive (i.e., hope for success and fear of failure) and need for cognition were examined. Overall, 476 adolescents (t\nSecond-order latent growth models indicated that fluid intelligence predicted a steeper growth in hope for success (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.40), but was unrelated to change in the other investment traits. Crystallized intelligence had no effects on the investment traits under study.\nThe results contribute to the research on the bidirectionality of intelligence and investment traits and add to our understanding of personality development from mid to late adolescence. Specifically, they underline the importance of nurturing hope for success especially in individuals with lower intelligence, but also show that support for the environmental success hypothesis seems to be limited to certain investment traits.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke (IS) with subsequent cerebrocardiac syndrome (CCS) has a poor prognosis. We aimed to investigate electrocardiogram (ECG) changes after IS with artificial intelligence (AI).\nWe collected ECGs from a healthy population and patients with IS, and then analyzed participant demographics and ECG parameters to identify abnormal features in post-IS ECGs. Next, we trained the convolutional neural network (CNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models to automatically detect the changes in the ECGs; Additionally, We compared the CNN scores of good prognosis (mRS \u2264 2) and poor prognosis (mRS > 2) to assess the prognostic value of CNN model. Finally, we used gradient class activation map (Grad-CAM) to localize the key abnormalities.\nAmong the 3506 ECGs of the IS patients, 2764 ECGs (78.84%) led to an abnormal diagnosis. Then we divided ECGs in the primary cohort into three groups, normal ECGs (N-Ns), abnormal ECGs after the first ischemic stroke (A-ISs), and normal ECGs after the first ischemic stroke (N-ISs). Basic demographic and ECG parameter analyses showed that heart rate, QT interval, and P-R interval were significantly different between 673 N-ISs and 3546 N-Ns (p < 0.05). The CNN has the best performance among the three models in distinguishing A-ISs and N-Ns (AUC: 0.88, 95%CI = 0.86-0.90). The prediction scores of the A-ISs and N-ISs obtained from the all three models are statistically different from the N-Ns (p < 0.001). Futhermore, the CNN scores of the two groups (mRS > 2 and mRS \u2264 2) were significantly different (p < 0.05). Finally, Grad-CAM revealed that the V4 lead may harbor the highest probability of abnormality.\nOur study showed that a high proportion of post-IS ECGs harbored abnormal changes. Our CNN model can systematically assess anomalies in and prognosticate post-IS ECGs.",

    "results": "Among the 3506 ECGs of the IS patients, 2764 ECGs (78.84%) led to an abnormal diagnosis. Then we divided ECGs in the primary cohort into three groups, normal ECGs (N-Ns), abnormal ECGs after the first ischemic stroke (A-ISs), and normal ECGs after the first ischemic stroke (N-ISs). Basic demographic and ECG parameter analyses showed that heart rate, QT interval, and P-R interval were significantly different between 673 N-ISs and 3546 N-Ns (p < 0.05). The CNN has the best performance among the three models in distinguishing A-ISs and N-Ns (AUC: 0.88, 95%CI = 0.86-0.90). The prediction scores of the A-ISs and N-ISs obtained from the all three models are statistically different from the N-Ns (p < 0.001). Futhermore, the CNN scores of the two groups (mRS > 2 and mRS \u2264 2) were significantly different (p < 0.05). Finally, Grad-CAM revealed that the V4 lead may harbor the highest probability of abnormality.",

Although process improvements have been put in place to streamline workflows, complex pathways, disparate imaging locations, and fragmented communications all highlight the need for continued improvement.\nThis Quality Improvement Initiative (VISIION) was implemented to assess our transition to the Viz.ai platform for immediate image review and centralized communication and their effect on key performance indicators in our comprehensive stroke center. We compared periods before and following deployment. Sequential patients having undergone stroke thrombectomy were included. Both direct arriving large-vessel occlusion and Brain Emergency Management Initiative telemedicine transfer large-vessel occlusion cases were assessed as were subgroups of OnHours and OffHours. Text messaging thread counts were compared between time periods to assess communications. Mann-Whitney \nEighty-two neurointerventional cases were analyzed pre vs. post time periods: (DALVO-OnHours 7 versus 7, DALVO-OffHours 10 versus 5, BEMI-OnHours 13 versus 6, BEMI-OffHours 17 versus 17). DALVO-OffHours had a 39% door-to-groin reduction (157 versus 95 minutes, \nThere was an immediate improvement following Viz.ai implementation for both direct arriving and telemedicine transfer thrombectomy cases. In the greatest opportunity subset (direct arriving large-vessel occlusion-OffHours: direct arriving cases requiring team mobilization off-hours), we noted a 39% improvement. With Viz.ai, we noted that immediate access to images and streamlined communications improved door-to-groin time metrics for thrombectomy. These results have implications for future care processes and can be a model for centers striving to optimize workflow and improve thrombectomy timeliness.",

    "abstract": "Anterior closing wedge osteotomies (ACWO) are performed in revision anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery to correct an excessive posterior tibial slope (PTS).\nWith the help of automated planning software, this study investigates the assumption that 1mm of wedge height gives 1\u00b0 of slope correction (1:1).\nFifty patients underwent ACWO, with the wedge height calculated using the 1:1 formula. Pre- and postosteotomy PTS were measured manually, and the achieved post-operative PTS was compared with the target PTS of 5.3\u00b0 \u00b1 1.9. The X-ray analysis was repeated virtually with the automated software, which also recommended a resection height. These parameters were then compared with the manually obtained parameters.\nUsing a 1:1 formula, wedge heights of 8.5mm \u00b1 2.3 was resected to achieve a PTS of 4.2\u00b0 \u00b1 0.32. This showed an overcorrection of 1.6\u00b0 \u00b1 0.8 from the target slope. This was consistent with the data from the automated software, which recommended a lower wedge height of 7.7mm \u00b1 2.9.\nIn trans-tubercle ACW, using a wedge height (mm) to slope correction (\u00b0) ratio of 1:1 can lead to slight over-correction.

    "abstract": "Clinical evaluation of the shoulder range of motion (RoM) may vary significantly depending on the surgeon. We aim to validate an automatic shoulder RoM measurement system associating image acquisition by an RGB-D (red/green/blue-depth) video camera to an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm.\nThirty healthy volunteers were included. A 3D RGB-D sensor that simultaneously generated a colour image and a depth map was used. Then, an open-access convolutional neural network algorithm that was programmed for shoulder recognition provided a 3D motion measure. Each volunteer adopted a randomized position successively. For each position, two observers made a visual (EyeREF) and goniometric measurement (GonioREF), blind to the automated software which was implemented by an orthopaedic surgeon. We evaluated the inter-tester intra-class correlation (ICC) between observers and the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) between the three methods.\nFor manual evaluations EyeREF and GonioREF, ICC remained constantly excellent for the widest motions in the vertical plane (i.e., abduction and flexion). It was very good for ER1 and IR2 and fairly good for adduction, extension, and ER2. Differences between the measurements' means of EyeREF and shoulder RoM was significant for all motions. Compared to GonioREF, shoulder RoM provided similar results for abduction, adduction, and flexion and EyeREF provided similar results for adduction, ER1, and ER2. The three methods showed an overall good to excellent CCC. The mean bias between the three methods remained under 10\u00b0 and clinically acceptable.\nRGB-D/AI combination is reliable in measuring shoulder RoM in consultation, compared to classic goniometry and visual observation.",

    "abstract": "In 2018, the \"Ateliers de Giens\" (Giens Workshops) devoted a workshop to artificial intelligence (AI) and led its experts to confirm the potential contribution and theoretical benefit of AI in clinical research, pharmacovigilance, and in improving the efficiency of care. The 2022 workshop is a continuation of this reflection on AI and intelligent automation (IA) by focusing on its contribution to pharmacovigilance and the applications and tasks could be optimized to preserve and strengthen medical and pharmacological expertise in pharmacovigilance. The evolution of pharmacovigilance work is characterized by many tasks with low added value, a growing volume of pharmacovigilance reporting of suspected side effects, and a scarcity of medical staff with expertise in clinical pharmacology and pharmacovigilance and human resources to support this growing need. Together, these parameters contribute to an embolization of the pharmacovigilance system at risk of missing its primary mission: to identify and characterize a risk or even a health alert on a drug. The participants of the workshop (representatives of the Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres (CRPV), the French National Agency for Safety of Medicinal Products (ANSM), patients, the pharmaceutical industry, or start-ups working in the development of AI in the field of medicine) shared their experiences, their pilot projects and their expectations on the expected potential, theoretical or proven, AI and IA. This work has made it possible to identify the needs and challenges that AI or IA represent, in the current or future modes of organization of pharmacovigilance activities. This approach led to the development of a SWOT matrix (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats), a basis for reflection to identify critical points and consider four main recommendations: (1) preserve and develop business expertise in pharmacovigilance (including research and development in methods) with the integration of new technologies; (2) improve the quality of pharmacovigilance reports; (3) adapt technical and regulatory means; (4) implement a development strategy for AI and IA tools at the service of expertise.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have enabled precise three-dimensional analysis of individual muscles on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance images via automatic segmentation. This study aimed to perform three-dimensional assessments of pelvic and thigh muscle atrophy and fatty degeneration in patients with unilateral hip osteoarthritis using CT and to evaluate the correlation with health-related quality of life (HRQoL).\nThe study included one man and 43 women. Six muscle groups were segmented, and the muscle atrophy ratio was calculated volumetrically. The degree of fatty degeneration was defined as the difference between the mean CT values (Hounsfield units [HU]) of the healthy and affected sides. HRQoL was evaluated using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association Hip Disease Evaluation Questionnaire (JHEQ).\nThe mean muscle atrophy rate was 16.3%, and the mean degree of muscle fatty degeneration was 7.9 HU. Multivariate correlation analysis revealed that the WOMAC stiffness subscale was significantly related to fatty degeneration of the hamstrings, the WOMAC physical function subscale was significantly related to fatty degeneration of the iliopsoas muscle, and the JHEQ movement subscale was significantly related to fatty degeneration of the hip adductors.\nWe found that fatty degeneration of the hamstrings, iliopsoas, and hip adductor muscles was significantly related to HRQoL in patients with hip osteoarthritis. These findings suggest that these muscles should be targeted during conservative rehabilitation for HOA and perioperative rehabilitation for THA.",

    "abstract": "The development of a multitarget ultrasensitive immunoassay is significant to fields such as medical research, clinical diagnosis, and food safety inspection. In this study, an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted programmable-particle-decoding technique (APT)-based digital immunoassay system was developed to perform multitarget ultrasensitive detection. Multitarget was encoded by programmable polystyrene (PS) microspheres with different characteristics (particle size and number), and subsequent visible signals were recorded under an optical microscope after the immune reaction. The resultant images were further analyzed using a customized, AI-based computer vision technique to decode the intrinsic properties of polystyrene microspheres and to reveal the types and concentrations of targets. Our strategy has successfully detected multiple inflammatory markers in clinical serum and antibiotics with a broad detection range from pg/mL to \u03bcg/mL without extra signal amplification and conversion. An AI-based digital immunoassay system exhibits great potential to be used for the next generation of multitarget detection in disease screening for candidate patients.",

    "abstract": "Lynch syndrome (LS), an autosomal dominant disorder caused by pathogenic germline variants in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, represents the most common hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndrome. Lynch syndrome patients are at high risk of CRC despite regular endoscopic surveillance.\nOur aim was to investigate the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted colonoscopy in comparison to High-Definition white-light endoscopy (HD-WLE) for the first time.\nPatients \u226518\u00a0years with LS, with a pathogenic germline variant (MLH1, MHS2, MSH6), and at least one previous colonoscopy (interval 10-36\u00a0months) were eligible. Patients were stratified by previous CRC and affected MMR gene with a 1:1 allocation ratio (AI-assisted vs. HD white-light endoscopy) in this exploratory pilot trial.\nBetween Dec-2021 and Dec-2022, 101 LS patients were randomised and 96 patients were finally analyzed after exclusion of 5 patients due to insufficient bowel preparation. In the HD-WLE arm, adenomas were detected in 12/46 patients compared to 18/50 in the AI arm (26.1% [95% CI 14.3-41.1] vs. 36.0% [22.9-50.8]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.379). The use of AI-assisted colonoscopy especially increased detection of flat adenomas (Paris classification 0-IIb) (examinations with detected flat adenomas: 3/46 [6.5%] vs. 10/50 [20%]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.07; numbers of detected flat adenomas: 4/20 vs. 17/30, p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). The median withdrawal time did not differ significantly between HD-WLE and AI (14 vs. 15\u00a0min; p\u00a0=\u00a00.170).\nWe here present first data suggesting that real-time AI-assisted colonoscopy is a promising approach to optimize endoscopic surveillance in LS patients, in particular to improve the detection of flat adenomas.",

    "abstract": "The normalization of epidemic prevention and control has exacerbated nurses' physical and mental stresses. The important role of physical activity in relieving nurses' physical and mental stresses has received extensive attention from researchers in recent years. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of physical activity on the regulatory emotional self-efficacy, resilience, and emotional intelligence of nurses and explain their interactions. The present study adopted the cluster sampling method. From April to May 2022, a total of 500 nurses in six municipal hospitals in Changsha City were selected. Finally, 402 valid data samples were obtained. Afterward, AMOS 23.0 (by maximum likelihood estimation) was used to process the collected data and analyze the proposed hypotheses by using 5,000 bootstrap samples to test the mediating effects of the structural equation model. The results demonstrated that there are positive correlations between physical activity and resilience (standardized coefficients\u2009=\u20090.232, ",

    "abstract": "Fueled by the development of neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI), recent advances in the brain-inspired AI have manifested a tipping-point in the collaboration of the two fields. AI began with the inspiration of neuroscience, but has evolved to achieve a remarkable performance with little dependence upon neuroscience. However, in a recent collaboration, research into neurobiological explainability of AI models found that these highly accurate models may resemble the neurobiological representation of the same computational processes in the brain, although these models have been developed in the absence of such neuroscientific references. In this perspective, we review the cooperation and separation between neuroscience and AI, and emphasize on the current advance, that is, a new cooperation, the neurobiological explainability of AI. Under the intertwined development of the two fields, we propose a practical framework to evaluate the brain-likeness of AI models, paving the way for their further improvements.",

    "abstract": "Current methodologies to model connectivity in complex networks either rely on network scientists' intelligence to discover reliable physical rules or use artificial intelligence (AI) that stacks hundreds of inaccurate human-made rules to make a new one that optimally summarizes them together. Here, we provide an accurate and reproducible scientific analysis showing that, contrary to the current belief, stacking more good link prediction rules does not necessarily improve the link prediction performance to nearly optimal as suggested by recent studies. Finally, under the light of our novel results, we discuss the pros and cons of each current state-of-the-art link prediction strategy, concluding that none of the current solutions are what the future might hold for us. Future solutions might require the design and development of next generation \"creative\" AI that are able to generate and understand complex physical rules for us.",

    "abstract": "Looking at the rapidity the social media has gained ascendancy in the society, coupled with considerable shortage of addressing the health of the social media users, there is a pressing need for employing mechanized systems to help identify individuals at risk. In this study, we investigated potential of people's social media language in order to predict their vulnerability towards the future episode of mental distress. This work aims to (a) explore the most frequent affective expressions used by online users which reflect their mental health condition and (b) develop predictive models to detect users with risk of psychological distress. In this paper, dominant sentiment extraction techniques were employed to quantify the affective expressions and classify and predict the incident of psychological distress. We trained a set of seven supervised machine learning classifiers on logs crowd-sourced from 2500 Indian Social Networking Sites (SNS) users and validated with 3149 tweets collected from Indian Twitter. We test the model on these two different SNS datasets with different scales and ground truth labeling method and discuss the relationship between key factors and mental health. Performance of classifiers is evaluated at all classification thresholds; accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score. and experimental results show a better traction of accuracies ranging from\u2009~\u200982 to\u2009~\u200999% as compared to the models of relevant existing studies. Thus, this paper presents a mechanized decision support system to detect users' susceptibility towards mental distress and provides several evidences that it can be utilized as an efficient tool to preserve the psychological health of the social media users.",

    "abstract": "Plasma cells as an important component of immune microenvironment plays a crucial role in immune escape and are closely related to immune therapy response. However, its role for prostate cancer is rarely understood. In this study, we intend to investigate the value of a new plasma cell molecular subtype for predicting the biochemical recurrence, immune escape and immunotherapy response in prostate cancer.\nGene expression and clinicopathological data were collected from 481 prostate cancer patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas. Then, the immune characteristics of the patients were analyzed based on plasma cell infiltration fractions. The unsupervised clustering based machine learning algorithm was used to identify the molecular subtypes of the plasma cell. And the characteristic genes of plasma cell subtypes were screened out by three types of machine learning models to establish an artificial neural network for predicting plasma cell subtypes. Finally, the prediction artificial neural network of plasma cell infiltration subtypes was validated in an independent cohort of 449 prostate cancer patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus.\nThe plasma cell fraction in prostate cancer was significantly decreased in tumors with high T stage, high Gleason score and lymph node metastasis. In addition, low plasma cell fraction patients had a higher risk of biochemical recurrence. Based on the differential genes of plasma cells, plasma cell infiltration status of PCa patients were divided into two independent molecular subtypes(subtype 1 and subtype 2). Subtype 1 tends to be immunosuppressive plasma cells infiltrating to the PCa region, with a higher likelihood of biochemical recurrence, more active immune microenvironment, and stronger immune escape potential, leading to a poor response to immunotherapy. Subsequently, 10 characteristic genes of plasma cell subtype were screened out by three machine learning algorithms. Finally, an artificial neural network was constructed by those 10 genes to predict the plasma cell subtype of new patients. This artificial neural network was validated in an independent validation set, and the similar results were gained.\nPlasma cell infiltration subtypes could provide a potent prognostic predictor for prostate cancer and be an option for potential responders to prostate cancer immunotherapy.",

    "results": "The plasma cell fraction in prostate cancer was significantly decreased in tumors with high T stage, high Gleason score and lymph node metastasis. In addition, low plasma cell fraction patients had a higher risk of biochemical recurrence. Based on the differential genes of plasma cells, plasma cell infiltration status of PCa patients were divided into two independent molecular subtypes(subtype 1 and subtype 2). Subtype 1 tends to be immunosuppressive plasma cells infiltrating to the PCa region, with a higher likelihood of biochemical recurrence, more active immune microenvironment, and stronger immune escape potential, leading to a poor response to immunotherapy. Subsequently, 10 characteristic genes of plasma cell subtype were screened out by three machine learning algorithms. Finally, an artificial neural network was constructed by those 10 genes to predict the plasma cell subtype of new patients. This artificial neural network was validated in an independent validation set, and the similar results were gained.",

    "abstract": "The expectations of professionals working on the development of healthcare Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and the patients who will be affected by them have received limited attention. This paper reports on a Foresight Workshop with professionals involved with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and a Focus Group with members of a PH patient group, to discuss expectations of AI development and implementation. We show that while professionals and patients had similar expectations of AI, with respect to the priority of early diagnosis; data risks of privacy and reuse; and responsibility, other expectations differed. One important point of difference was in the attitude toward using AI to point up other potential health problems (in addition to PH). A second difference was in the expectations regarding how much clinical professionals should know about the role of AI in diagnosis. These findings allow us to better prepare for the future by providing a frank appraisal of the complexities of AI development with foresight, and the anxieties of key stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Dementia is an umbrella term indicating a group of diseases that affect the cognitive sphere. Dementia is not a mere individual health issue, since its interference with the ability to carry out daily activities entails a series of collateral problems, comprising exclusion of patients from civil rights and welfare, unpaid caregiving work, mostly performed by women, and an additional burden on the public healthcare systems. Thus, gender and wealth inequalities (both among individuals and among countries) tend to amplify the social impact of such a disease. Since at present there is no cure for dementia but only drug treatments to slow down its progress and mitigate the symptoms, it is essential to work on prevention and early diagnosis, identifying the risk factors that increase the probability of its onset. The complex and multifactorial etiology of dementia, resulting from an interplay between genetics and environmental factors, can benefit from a multidisciplinary approach that follows the \"One Health\" guidelines of the World Health Organization.\nIn this work, we apply methods of Artificial Intelligence and complex systems physics to investigate the possibility to predict dementia prevalence throughout world countries from a set of variables concerning individual health, food consumption, substance use and abuse, healthcare system efficiency. The analysis uses publicly available indicator values at a country level, referred to a time window of 26 years.\nEmploying methods based on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and complex networks, we identify a group of lifestyle factors, mostly concerning nutrition, that contribute the most to dementia incidence prediction.\nThe proposed approach provides a methodological basis to develop quantitative tools for action patterns against such a disease, which involves issues deeply related with sustainable, such as good health and resposible food consumption.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning based artificial intelligence technology for big data processing has shown great potential in predicting patients' conditions and aiding clinical decisions, and has been widely used in the development of clinical decision support systems in recent years. Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by host response disorder caused by infection, and its early recognition and treatment can significantly improve the prognosis of patients. At present, there are many deficiencies in the clinical application of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), bedside quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA), national early warning score (NEWS), inflammatory indicators, and novel biomarkers for evaluating sepsis. Artificial intelligence has promoted the development of critical care medicine because of its ability to rapidly process and analyze massive data of severe patients. This paper reviews the recent application of artificial intelligence in the early diagnosis and prediction of sepsis, in order to emphasize the importance and limitations of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and prediction of sepsis.",

    "abstract": "In many countries, workers who developed asbestosis due to their occupation are eligible for government support. Based on the results of clinical examination, a team of pulmonologists determine the eligibility of patients to these programs. In this Dutch cohort study, we aim to demonstrate the potential role of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system for automated, standardized, and cost-effective evaluation of applications for asbestosis patients.\nA dataset of n = 523 suspected asbestosis cases/applications from across the Netherlands was retrospectively collected. Each case/application was reviewed, and based on the criteria, a panel of three pulmonologists would determine eligibility for government support. An AI system is proposed, which uses thoracic CT images as input, and predicts the assessment of the clinical panel. Alongside imaging, we evaluated the added value of lung function parameters.\nThe proposed AI algorithm reached an AUC of 0.87 (p < 0.001) in the prediction of accepted versus rejected applications. Diffusion capacity (DLCO) also showed comparable predictive value (AUC = 0.85, p < 0.001), with little correlation between the two parameters (r-squared = 0.22, p < 0.001). The combination of the imaging AI score and DLCO achieved superior performance (AUC = 0.95, p < 0.001). Interobserver variability between pulmonologists on the panel was estimated at alpha = 0.65 (Krippendorff's alpha).\nWe developed an AI system to support the clinical decision-making process for the application to the government support for asbestosis. A multicenter prospective validation study is currently ongoing to examine the added value and reliability of this system alongside the clinic panel.\n\u2022 Artificial intelligence can detect imaging patterns of asbestosis in CT scans in a cohort of patients applying for state aid. \u2022 Combining the AI prediction with the diffusing lung function parameter reaches the highest diagnostic performance. \u2022 Specific cases with fibrosis but no asbestosis were correctly classified, suggesting robustness of the AI system, which is currently under prospective validation.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to augment clinicians' diagnostic and decision-making capabilities. It is well suited to identify patterns and correlations within data sets and may be applied to identify elements of importance in complex and data-laden areas such as patient selection, diagnostics, treatment, and outcome prediction. The development of modern neurosurgery has been dependent on major technological advances. In line with this, a growing interest is seen in the use of AI to assist in neurosurgical research and enhance neurosurgical practices.\nA bibliometric analysis of the 50 most-cited articles alluding to the use of AI in neurosurgery, from inception until July of 2022, was undertaken using the Web of Science database. Statistical analyses were performed on R.\nThe citation count ranged from 29 to 159 (mean: 51.9, standard deviation: 24.8), and the top-cited article was a 2018 systematic review published in World Neurosurgery. Most articles were published after 2015 (85%). The United States was the largest contributing country on the list with 22 articles. Four first and last authors, each, had 2 or more publications. Female first and last authorship was attributed to 18% and 0% of the articles, respectively.\nThis review highlights the most-impactful articles pertaining to AI in the field of neurosurgery. Although female authors were significantly underrepresented on the list, their work was at least as impactful as their male peers. Finally, the striking dominance of articles originating from the developed world raises concerns as to the future of AI in attending to the global health crisis.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the principal cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection of lung cancer with screening is indispensable to reduce the high morbidity and mortality rates. Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely utilised in healthcare, including in the assessment of medical images. A growing number of reviews studied the application of AI in lung cancer screening, but no overarching meta-analysis has examined the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of AI-based imaging for lung cancer screening.\nTo systematically review the DTA of AI-based imaging for lung cancer screening.\nPubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses were searched from inception to date. Studies that were published in English and that evaluated the performance of AI-based imaging for lung cancer screening were included. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts and used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool to appraise the quality of selected studies. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation to diagnostic tests was used to assess the certainty of evidence.\nTwenty-six studies with 150,721 imaging data were included. Hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic model used for meta-analysis demonstrated that the pooled sensitivity for AI-based imaging for lung cancer screening was 94.6\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 91.4\u00a0% to 96.7\u00a0%) and specificity was 93.6\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 88.5\u00a0% to 96.6\u00a0%). Subgroup analyses revealed that similar results were found among different types of AI, region, data source, and year of publication, but the overall quality of evidence was very low.\nAI-based imaging could effectively detect lung cancer and be incorporated into lung cancer screening programs. Further high-quality DTA studies on large lung cancer screening populations are required to validate AI's role in early lung cancer detection.",

    "abstract": "There is a significant overlap in symptomology between individuals with deficits in attention and learning, which is explained by the co-dependent dynamic between the two cognitive constructs. Within this dynamic, attentional resources are allocated to salient stimuli while learning mechanisms distinguish relevant from irrelevant information. Moreover, individuals with deficits in higher-order cognition (i.e., intelligence) can demonstrate difficulties in attention and learning. The Multiple Object-Tracking (MOT) task is a sensitive and versatile measure of attention that has characterized individual differences in attention as a function of higher-order cognition. Exploiting the traditional MOT task's ability to characterize the allocation of attentional resources to task demands, the current study compared learning exhibited on an attention-based task across neurodevelopmental conditions defined by deficits in attention (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; ADHD), learning (specific learning disorder; SLD), and intelligence (intellectual developmental disorder; IDD). Children and adolescents (N\u00a0=\u00a0101) completed 15 sessions on a Multiple Object-Tracking (MOT) task where performance trajectories were analyzed using latent growth curve modeling and conditioned by the presence of ADHD, SLD, or IDD while controlling for performance on a separate measure of attention, age, and sex. The sample, characterized by below-average IQ and problematic levels of attention, exhibited an effect of learning on MOT. However, individuals with an IDD diagnosis demonstrated decreased baseline MOT capability while ADHD and SLD profiles exhibited decreased slopes, relative to other neurodevelopmental conditions. Taken together, the results demonstrate distinct linear performance trajectories between neurodevelopmental conditions defined by deficits in attention, learning, and intelligence. The current study provides additional evidence to repurpose the traditional MOT task as a descriptor of attention and discusses alternative uses for the paradigm. Overall, these results suggest an eclectic approach that considers attention, learning, and higher-order cognition when diagnosing ADHD, SLD, or IDD.",

    "abstract": "Anthropomorphic phantoms are used in surgical planning and intervention. Ideal accuracy and high efficiency are prerequisites for its clinical application. We aimed to develop a fully automated artificial intelligence-based three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction system (AI system) to assist thoracic surgery and to determine its accuracy, efficiency, and safety for clinical use.\nThis AI system was developed based on a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and optimized by gradient descent after training with 500 cases, achieving a Dice coefficient of 89.2%. Accuracy was verified by comparing virtual structures predicted by the AI system with anatomical structures of patients in retrospective (n\u00a0=\u00a0113) and prospective cohorts (n\u00a0=\u00a0139) who underwent lobectomy or segmentectomy at the Peking University Cancer Hospital. Operation time and blood loss were compared between the retrospective cohort (without AI assistance) and prospective cohort (with AI assistance) for safety evaluation. The time consumption for reconstruction and the quality score were compared between the AI system and manual reconstruction software (Mimics\u00ae) for efficiency validation. This study was registered at https://www.chictr.org.cn as ChiCTR2100050985.\nThe AI system reconstructed 13,608 pulmonary segmental branches from retrospective and prospective cohorts, and 1573 branches of interest corresponding to phantoms were detectable during the operation for verification, achieving 100% and 97% accuracy for segmental bronchi, 97.2% and 99.1% for segmental arteries, and 93.2% and 98.8% for segmental veins, respectively. With the assistance of the AI system, the operation time was shortened by 24.5\u00a0min for lobectomy (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and 20\u00a0min for segmentectomy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Compared to Mimics\u00ae, the AI system reduced the model reconstruction time by 14.2\u00a0min (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and it also outperformed Mimics\u00ae in model quality scores (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nThe AI system can accurately predict thoracic anatomical structures with higher efficiency than manual reconstruction software. Constant optimization and larger population validation are required.\nThis study was funded by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No. L222020) and other sources.",

    "abstract": "Fluid assessment is challenging, and fluid overload poses a significant problem among dialysis patients, with pulmonary oedema being the most serious consequence. Our study aims to develop a simple objective fluid assessment strategy using lung ultrasound (LUS) and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess the fluid status of dialysis patients.\nThis was a single-centre study of 76 hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients carried out between July 2020 to May 2022. The fluid status of dialysis patients was assessed via a simplified 8-point LUS method using a portable handheld ultrasound device (HHUSD), clinical examination and bioimpedance analysis (BIA). The primary outcome was the performance of 8-point LUS using a portable HHUSD in diagnosing fluid overload compared to physical examination and BIA. The secondary outcome was to develop and validate a novel AI software program to quantify B-line count and assess the fluid status of dialysis patients.\nOur study showed a moderate correlation between LUS B-line count and fluid overload assessed by clinical examination (r\u2009=\u20090.475, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and BIA (r\u2009=\u20090.356. p\u2009<\u20090.001). The use of AI to detect B-lines on LUS in our study for dialysis patients was shown to have good agreement with LUS B lines observed by physicians; (r\u2009=\u20090.825, p\u2009<\u20090.001) for the training dataset and (r\u2009=\u20090.844, p\u2009<\u20090.001) for the validation dataset.\nOur study confirms that 8-point LUS using HHUSD, with AI-based detection of B lines, can provide clinically useful information on the assessment of hydration status and diagnosis of fluid overload for dialysis patients in a user-friendly and time-efficient way.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is producing shifts in the distribution and abundance of marine species. Such is the case of kelp forests, important marine ecosystem-structuring species whose distributional range limits have been shifting worldwide. Synthesizing long-term time series of kelp forest observations is therefore vital for understanding the drivers shaping ecosystem dynamics and for predicting responses to ongoing and future climate changes. Traditional methods of mapping kelp from satellite imagery are time-consuming and expensive, as they require high amount of human effort for image processing and algorithm optimization. Here we propose the use of mask region-based convolutional neural networks (Mask R-CNN) to automatically assimilate data from open-source satellite imagery (Landsat Thematic Mapper) and detect kelp forest canopy cover. The analyses focused on the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera along the shorelines of southern California and Baja California in the northeastern Pacific. Model hyper-parameterization was tuned through cross-validation procedures testing the effect of data augmentation, and different learning rates and anchor sizes. The optimal model detected kelp forests with high performance and low levels of overprediction (Jaccard's index: 0.87\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07; Dice index: 0.93\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04; over prediction: 0.06) and allowed reconstructing a time series of 32\u00a0years in Baja California (Mexico), a region known for its high variability in kelp owing to El Ni\u00f1o events. The proposed framework based on Mask R-CNN now joins the list of cost-efficient tools for long-term marine ecological monitoring, facilitating well-informed biodiversity conservation, management and decision making.",

    "abstract": "Rapid chemical functionalization of additives and efficient determination of their optimum concentrations are important for designing high-performance lubricants, especially under multi-additive conditions. Herein, chemically functionalized graphene (FGR) and carbon nanotubes (FCNTs) were rapidly prepared by microwave-assisted ball milling and subsequently introduced into grease as additives. The tribological properties of the additives in grease at different concentrations and ratios were measured using a four-ball test. A reliable artificial neural network (ANN) model was established according to a few test results. Subsequently, the optimal concentration of multiple additives in the grease was predicted using a genetic algorithm and experimentally validated. The results indicated that the introduction of FGR (0.14 wt %) and FCNT (0.16 wt %) improved the antifriction and anti-wear performance of the base grease by 25.66 and 29.34%, respectively. The results of the ANN model analysis and friction interface characterization indicate that such performance is principally attributed to the synergistic lubrication of the FGR and FCNT.",

    "abstract": "The healthcare burden of cardiovascular diseases remains a major issue worldwide. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and improving identification of people with a higher risk profile of systemic vascular disease through noninvasive examinations is crucial. In ophthalmology, retinal vascular network imaging is simple and noninvasive and can provide in vivo information of the microstructure and vascular health. For more than 10\u00a0years, different research teams have been working on developing software to enable automatic analysis of the retinal vascular network from different imaging techniques (retinal fundus photographs, OCT angiography, adaptive optics, etc.) and to provide a description of the geometric characteristics of its arterial and venous components. Thus, the structure of retinal vessels could be considered a witness of the systemic vascular status. A new approach called \"oculomics\" using retinal image datasets and artificial intelligence algorithms recently increased the interest in retinal microvascular biomarkers. Despite the large volume of associated research, the role of retinal biomarkers in the screening, monitoring, or prediction of systemic vascular disease remains uncertain. A PubMed search was conducted until August 2022 and yielded relevant peer-reviewed articles based on a set of inclusion criteria. This literature review is intended to summarize the state of the art in oculomics and cardiovascular disease research.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence education will be an important part of information technology education in the future. It will enter the classroom and the learning life of students in various forms. The modern teaching media used in artificial intelligence courses at universities include some conventional teaching courseware, multimedia videos, and tool software. Some teaching media are unique to artificial intelligence, such as smart software, smart devices, and smart websites. The existing cross-cultural competence dimensions and evaluation scales were theoretically explained with factor analysis by comparing and selecting comprehensive evaluation methods in the work. Its main advantages were as follows: simple mathematical models and easy operation. The construction of a comprehensive evaluation model for college students' cross-cultural competence included the principles and ideas of model construction, the methods and steps of model construction, and model calculations. The survey results showed that the four-level scores of all samples had a significant positive correlation with foreign cultural knowledge, attitudes, and cross-cultural communication skills at 0.01 level (bilateral) and 0.05 (bilateral), respectively.",

    "abstract": "Online impulse buying behavior is an unplanned urge to buy a product or service in an online setting and it has several negative consequences for customers, such as guilt and financial distress, and e-commerce firms, such as higher returns and customer complaints. Evidently, it is important to examine the various psychological processes which may assist in a better understanding, therefore addressing the high prevalence of online impulse buying. This study builds upon self-regulation theory to explore how mindfulness influences online impulse buying, and examines problematic internet use as a mediator in the relationship between mindfulness and online impulse buying. Further, this study investigates how emotional intelligence as a moderator plays the role of a suppressant on the adverse impact of problematic Internet use which fuels online impulse buying.\nA total of 598 individuals working with various servicebased industries responded to the questionnaire. Multiple regression and moderated mediation analysis was used using SPSS and AMOS for analyzing the data.\nProblematic internet use mediates the relationship between mindfulness and online impulse buying behavior. Emotional intelligence negatively moderates the relationship between problematic internet use and online impulse buying behavior.\nThis study findings outlined the inverse relationship of mindfulness & online impulse buying, along with the mediating effect of problematic internet use between mindfulness and online impulse buying. Further, this study showed how emotional intelligence played an important role as a moderator by suppressing the adverse impact of problematic Internet use and preventing online impulse buying. The study offers implications to online marketers in regulating the unplanned purchase process-while minimizing uninhibited buying behavior that leads to regret, and the subsequent intention to return products. Further, social and theoretical implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Forensic odontology may require a visual or clinical method during identification. Sometimes it may require forensic experts to refer to the existing technique to identify individuals, for example, by using the atlas to estimate the dental age. However, the existing technology can be a complicated procedure for a large-scale incident requiring a more significant number of forensic identifications, particularly during mass disasters. This has driven many experts to perform automation in their current practice to improve efficiency.\nThis article aims to evaluate current artificial intelligence applications and discuss their performance concerning the algorithm architecture used in forensic odontology.\nThis study summarizes the findings of 28 research papers published between 2010 and June 2022 using the Arksey and O'Malley framework, updated by the Joanna Briggs Institute Framework for Scoping Reviews methodology, highlighting the research trend of artificial intelligence technology in forensic odontology. In addition, a literature search was conducted on Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, Google Scholar, and PubMed, and the results were evaluated based on their content and significance.\nThe potential application of artificial intelligence technology in forensic odontology can be categorized into four: (1) human bite marks, (2) sex determination, (3) age estimation, and (4) dental comparison. This powerful tool can solve humanity's problems by giving an adequate number of datasets, the appropriate implementation of algorithm architecture, and the proper assignment of hyperparameters that enable the model to perform the prediction at a very high level of performance.\nThe reviewed articles demonstrate that machine learning techniques are reliable for studies involving continuous features such as morphometric parameters. However, machine learning models do not strictly require large training datasets to produce promising results. In contrast, deep learning enables the processing of unstructured data, such as medical images, which require large volumes of data. Occasionally, transfer learning was used to overcome the limitation of data. In the meantime, this method's capacity to automatically learn task-specific feature representations has made it a significant success in forensic odontology.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging evidence has shown the relationship of intelligence with several structural brain properties in normal individuals. However, this relationship with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) needs to be investigated.\nWe estimated grey matter (GM) density of the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan on 56 ADHD individuals, including 30 combined individuals (Mean\u00b1SD age: 10.44\u00b12.41, intelligence quotient: [IQ]=112.13\u00b113.15, male, 24 right hands) and 26 inattentive individuals (mean age =11.39\u00b12.1, IQ=107.44\u00b113.98, male, 28 right hands) as well as 30 IQ matched healthy control group (mean age=11.08\u00b12.15, IQ=115\u00b113.56, male, 23 right hands).\nIn this study, two statistical approaches were used. In the first approach, region-based as well as the whole association patterns between full-scale IQ and GM were computed and compared between groups. The second approach was to examine the differential pattern of GM density without considering IQ in three groups.\nResults showed significant differences between the ADHD group and the control. This finding could indicate that intelligence is not purely based on the density of GM in certain brain regions; it is a dynamic phenomenon and drastically changes neurodevelopmental disorders.\nIn ADHDs as compared to healthy controls the relation between GM and IQ was decreased at right hemisphere;In ADHDs as compared to healthy controls the relation between GM and IQ was increased at left hemisphere;Differenceses of the observed relation between control group and IQ matched ADHDs suggest a compensatory mechanism in ADHDs to maintaine an adequate cognitive performance;GM is not the only determiner of intelligence. IQ score may be affected by neural dynamic of the brain; therefore, the structural covariate could be a better alternative for GM density.\nIn this study, we estimated the relation between GM density and IQ score in 2 subtypes of ADHD (combined and inattentive) and IQ matched healthy control group. We compared the association between groups and found that the pattern of association in ADHDs were different from controls. In the other words, the decreased association at right hemisphere, were compensated by increased association at left hemisphere in ADHDs to maintaine adequate performance. We conclude that, the brain structure is not the single determiner of intelligence, rather intelligence may underpine by neural dynamics of the brain. Therefore, the structural covariate may be a better alternative for GM density.",

    "abstract": "Speech disorder is a significant problem for people affected with Parkinson's disease (PD) leading to a substantial disability to communicate with others. PD affects the voice, including changes in pitch, intensity, articulation, and syllable rate.We aimed to study the current status of artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning algorithms (MLAs) in the assessment of speech abnormalities in PD along with the generation of intelligible synthetic speech for voice rehabilitation. We searched the literature for studies focusing on speech/voice disorder in PD and rehabilitation techniques till June 18, 2022. We searched PubMed and Engineering Village (Compendex and Inspec combined) databases. After careful screening of the title and evaluation of abstracts, we used select articles describing the use of AI or its various forms in the management of speech abnormalities in PD to synthesize this review. MLAs classify PD and non-PD patients with an accuracy of more than 90% using only voice features. Non-acoustic sensors can rehabilitate PD patient by converting dysarthric speech to highly intelligible speech using MLAs. MLAs can automatically assess several speech features and quantify the progression of speech abnormalities in PD. PD speech rehabilitation using MLAs may prove superior to other available therapies.",

    "abstract": "Radar is widely employed in many applications, especially in autonomous driving. At present, radars are only designed as simple data collectors, and they are unable to meet new requirements for real-time and intelligent information processing as environmental complexity increases. It is inevitable that smart radar systems will need to be developed to deal with these challenges and digital twins in cyber-physical systems (CPS) have proven to be effective tools in many aspects. However, human involvement is closely related to radar technology and plays an important role in the operation and management of radars; thus, digital twins' radars in CPS are insufficient to realize smart radar systems due to the inadequate consideration of human factors. ACP-based parallel intelligence in cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS) is used to construct a novel framework for smart radars, called Parallel Radars. A Parallel Radar consists of three main parts: a Descriptive Radar for constructing artificial radar systems in cyberspace, a Predictive Radar for conducting computational experiments with artificial systems, and a Prescriptive Radar for providing prescriptive control to both physical and artificial radars to complete parallel execution. To connect silos of data and protect data privacy, federated radars are proposed. Additionally, taking mines as an example, the application of Parallel Radars in autonomous driving is discussed in detail, and various experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of Parallel Radars.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art healthcare technologies are incorporating advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, allowing for rapid and easy disease diagnosis. However, most AI models are considered \"black boxes,\" because there is no explanation for the decisions made by these models. Users may find it challenging to comprehend and interpret the results. Explainable AI (XAI) can explain the machine learning (ML) outputs and contribution of features in disease prediction models. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a potential predictive tool for understanding cortical impairment caused by an ischemic stroke and can be utilized for acute stroke prediction, neurologic prognosis, and post-stroke treatment. This study aims to utilize ML models to classify the ischemic stroke group and the healthy control group for acute stroke prediction in active states. Moreover, XAI tools (Eli5 and LIME) were utilized to explain the behavior of the model and determine the significant features that contribute to stroke prediction models. In this work, we studied 48 patients admitted to a hospital with acute ischemic stroke and 75 healthy adults who had no history of identified other neurological illnesses. EEG was obtained within three months following the onset of ischemic stroke symptoms using frontal, central, temporal, and occipital cortical electrodes (Fz, C1, T7, Oz). EEG data were collected in an active state (walking, working, and reading tasks). In the results of the ML approach, the Adaptive Gradient Boosting models showed around 80% accuracy for the classification of the control group and the stroke group. Eli5 and LIME were utilized to explain the behavior of the stroke prediction model and interpret the model locally around the prediction. The Eli5 and LIME interpretable models emphasized the spectral delta and theta features as local contributors to stroke prediction. From the findings of this explainable AI research, it is expected that the stroke-prediction XAI model will help with post-stroke treatment and recovery, as well as help healthcare professionals, make their diagnostic decisions more explainable.",

    "abstract": "Edge artificial intelligence (EDGE-AI) refers to the execution of artificial intelligence algorithms on hardware devices while processing sensor data/signals in order to extract information and identify patterns, without utilizing the cloud. In the field of predictive maintenance for industrial applications, EDGE-AI systems can provide operational state recognition for machines and production chains, almost in real time. This work presents two methodological approaches for the detection of the operational states of a DC motor, based on sound data. Initially, features were extracted using an audio dataset. Two different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were trained for the particular classification problem. These two models are subject to post-training quantization and an appropriate conversion/compression in order to be deployed to microcontroller units (MCUs) through utilizing appropriate software tools. A real-time validation experiment was conducted, including the simulation of a custom stress test environment, to check the deployed models' performance on the recognition of the engine's operational states and the response time for the transition between the engine's states. Finally, the two implementations were compared in terms of classification accuracy, latency, and resource utilization, leading to promising results.",

    "abstract": "Drug discovery is usually a rule-based process that is carefully carried out by pharmacists. However, a new trend is emerging in research and practice where artificial intelligence is being used for drug discovery to increase efficiency or to develop new drugs for previously untreatable diseases. Nevertheless, so far, no study takes a holistic view of AI-based drug discovery research. Given the importance and potential of AI for drug discovery, this lack of research is surprising. This study aimed to close this research gap by conducting a bibliometric analysis to identify all relevant studies and to analyze interrelationships among algorithms, institutions, countries, and funding sponsors. For this purpose, a sample of 3884 articles was examined bibliometrically, including studies from 1991 to 2022. We utilized various qualitative and quantitative methods, such as performance analysis, science mapping, and thematic analysis. Based on these findings, we furthermore developed a research agenda that aims to serve as a foundation for future researchers.",

    "abstract": "Liver transplantation outcomes have improved in recent years. However, with the emergence of expanded donor criteria, tools to better assist donor-recipient matching have become necessary. Most of the currently proposed scores based on conventional biostatistics are not good classifiers of a problem that is considered \"unbalanced.\" In recent years, the implementation of artificial intelligence in medicine has experienced exponential growth. Deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, may be the answer to this classification problem. The ability to handle a large number of variables with speed, objectivity, and multi-objective analysis is one of its advantages. Artificial neural networks and random forests have been the most widely used deep classifiers in this field. This review aims to give a brief overview of D-R matching and its evolution in recent years and how artificial intelligence may be able to provide a solution.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO), in their 2022 report, identified cancer as one of the leading causes of death, accounting for about 16% of deaths worldwide. The Cancer-Moonshot community aims to reduce the cancer death rate by half in the next 25 years and wants to improve the lives of cancer-affected people. Cancer mortality can be reduced if detected early and treated appropriately. Cancers like breast cancer and cervical cancer have high cure probabilities when treated early in accordance with best practices. Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into cancer research is currently addressing many of the challenges where medical experts fail to bring cancer to control and cure, and the outcomes are quite encouraging. AI offers many tools and platforms to facilitate more understanding and tackling of this life-threatening disease. AI-based systems can help pathologists in diagnosing cancer more accurately and consistently, reducing the case error rates. Predictive-AI models can estimate the likelihood for a person to get cancer by identifying the risk factors. Big data, together with AI, can enable medical experts to develop customized treatments for cancer patients. The side effects from this kind of customized therapy will be less severe in comparison with the generalized therapies. However, many of these AI tools will remain ineffective in fighting against cancer and saving the lives of millions of patients unless they are accessible and understandable to biologists, oncologists, and other medical cancer researchers. This paper presents the trends, challenges, and future directions of AI in cancer research. We hope that this paper will be of help to both medical experts and technical experts in getting a better understanding of the challenges and research opportunities in cancer diagnosis and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In the United States (US), the overall 5-year relative survival rate for pancreatic cancer during the 2012-2018 period was 11.5%. However, the cancer stage at diagnosis strongly influences relative survival in these patients. Per the National Cancer Institute (NCI) statistics for 2012-2018, the 5-year relative survival rate for patients with localized disease was 43.9%, while it was 3.1% for patients with distant metastasis. The poor survival rates are primarily due to the late development of clinical signs and symptoms. Hence, early diagnosis is critical in improving treatment outcomes. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained immense popularity in gastroenterology. AI-assisted endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) models have been touted as a breakthrough in the early detection of pancreatic cancer. These models may also accurately differentiate pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis and autoimmune pancreatitis, which mimics pancreatic cancer on radiological imaging. In this review, we detail the application of AI-assisted EUS models for pancreatic cancer detection. We also highlight the utility of AI-assisted EUS models in differentiating pancreatic cancer from radiological mimickers. Furthermore, we discuss the current limitations and future applications of AI technology in EUS for pancreatic cancers.",

    "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer in women. It has the poorest prognosis along with limited therapeutic options. Smart nano-based carriers are emerging as promising approaches in treating TNBC due to their favourable characteristics such as specifically delivering different cargos to cancer cells. However, nanoparticles' tumour cell uptake, and subsequent drug release, are essential factors considered during the drug development process. Contemporary qualitative analyses based on imaging are cumbersome and prone to human biases. Deep learning-based algorithms have been well-established in various healthcare settings with promising scope in drug discovery and development. In this study, the performance of five different convolutional neural network models was evaluated. In this research, we investigated two sequential models from scratch and three pre-trained models, VGG16, ResNet50, and Inception V3. These models were trained using confocal images of nanoparticle-treated cells loaded with a fluorescent anticancer agent. Comparative and cross-validation analyses were further conducted across all models to obtain more meaningful results. Our models showed high accuracy in predicting either high or low drug uptake and release into TNBC cells, indicating great translational potential into practice to aid in determining cellular uptake at the early stages of drug development in any area of research.",

    "abstract": "Education for sustainable development (ESD) is a holistic and transformative form of education that seeks action-oriented pedagogy using self-directed learning, participation, and collaboration, among other aspects, and is suitable for developing active methodologies. Since affective-emotional aspects can contribute in the teaching-learning process, this work studies, through a case study, the comparison of the influence of two active methodologies: Cooperative Learning (CL) and Project-Based Learning (PBL) in student emotions and learning processes, as well as their awareness of ESD. For that purpose, a survey was conducted at the fourth secondary level in the science laboratory, subjected to the innovation project e-WORLD, which developed the content of the 7 and 13 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from the 2030 Agenda. Results of ANOVA and Tukey's tests carried out showed that both methodologies improved skills and knowledge related to climate change and energy, and triggered major positive emotions in students. Furthermore, CL allowed students to acquire more individual and group responsibility than communication skills developed with PBL. It is necessary to continue working on the involvement of students in these methodologies in order to improve their social skills and to reveal life changes towards more socio-sustainable ones.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development and widespread popularity of the Internet, employee social media use at work has become an increasingly common phenomenon in organizations. This paper analyzes 105 related papers from the Social Science Citation Index in Web of Science through Scoping Review to clarify the definition and characteristics of employee social media use and the types of social media and summarizes the current research methods. Then, the reasons for employees' willingness and refusal to use social media and the positive and negative effects of employee social media use on employees' work attitudes, behaviors, and performance are discussed. Then, the mediating variables, moderating variables, and theoretical frameworks used in the relevant studies are described, and a comprehensive model of employee social media use is constructed. Finally, this paper indicates future research directions based on the latest research results in 2020-2022, i.e., improving research methods, increasing antecedent studies, expanding consequence research, and expanding mediating variables, moderating variables, and theoretical perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Technological innovation is a key component of orthopedic surgery. Artificial intelligence (AI), which describes the ability of computers to process massive data and \"learn\" from it to produce outputs that mirror human cognition and problem solving, may become an important tool for orthopedic surgeons in the future. AI may be able to improve decision making, both clinically and surgically, via integrating additional data-driven problem solving into practice. The aim of this article will be to review the current applications of AI in the management of rotator cuff tears. The article will discuss various stages of the clinical course: predictive models and prognosis, diagnosis, intraoperative applications, and postoperative care and rehabilitation. Throughout the article, which is a review in terms of study design, we will introduce the concept of AI in rotator cuff tears and provide examples of how these tools can impact clinical practice and patient care. Though many advancements in AI have been made regarding evaluating rotator cuff tears-particularly in the realm of diagnostic imaging-further advancements are required before they become a regular facet of daily clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined if Emotional Intelligence (EI), resilience, and self-esteem predicted life satisfaction in university students. We computed correlations between the study variables, then, we compared the differences between men and women. Finally, a simultaneous multiple regression was performed. The sample was composed of 2574 university students (715 were men and 1859 were women), whose age ranged from 18 to 30 years with a mean (M) of 20.83 and a standard deviation (SD) of 2.45. The instruments used were the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS), the Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale (ER-25), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), and the Diener Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). The results indicated that EI, self-esteem, and resilience correlated significantly and directly with satisfaction with life. Regarding sex differences, it was found that men had greater resilience, appraisal and recognition of emotion in others, and self-regulation of emotion. Women had greater appraisal and expression of emotion in self and self-esteem. The results showed that self-esteem, self-regulation of emotion, the use of emotion to facilitate performance, and acceptance of self and life as resilience factors predicted satisfaction with life. accounting for 48% of the variance. The variable that best predicted satisfaction with life was self-esteem.",

    "abstract": "Medical students face daily challenges such as large workload, time commitment and clinical environment pressure leading to a higher risk of psychological distress. The aim of our study was to assess the relationship between personality traits and depression, anxiety, and stress among Lebanese medical students and to evaluate the mediating role of emotional intelligence (EI) in this association. This cross-sectional study was conducted between June and December of 2019. Participants were from seven medical schools in Lebanon. Higher extraversion (B = -0.11), higher neuroticism (B = -0.28) and higher emotional intelligence (B = -0.03) were significantly associated with lower depression. Higher neuroticism (B = -0.29) and higher emotional intelligence (B = -0.03) were significantly associated with lower anxiety. Higher openness to experience (B = 0.07) and higher agreeableness (B = 0.08) were significantly associated with higher stress, whereas higher neuroticism (B = -0.05) was associated with lower stress. EI mediated the association between extraversion and depression and openness to experience and depression. EI mediated the association between extraversion and anxiety and openness to experience and anxiety. The results of this study were different from those previously cited in the literature. This could be secondary to the mediating role of emotional intelligence. This study consequently opens up the possibility of new studies highlighting the role of emotional intelligence in the possible preservation of medical students' mental health.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, epidemic and pandemic illnesses have grown prevalent and are a regular source of concern throughout the world. The extent to which the globe has been affected by the COVID-19 epidemic is well documented. Smart technology is now widely used in medical applications, with the automated detection of status and feelings becoming a significant study area. As a result, a variety of studies have begun to focus on the automated detection of symptoms in individuals infected with a pandemic or epidemic disease by studying their body language. The recognition and interpretation of arm and leg motions, facial recognition, and body postures is still a developing field, and there is a dearth of comprehensive studies that might aid in illness diagnosis utilizing artificial intelligence techniques and technologies. This literature review is a meta review of past papers that utilized AI for body language classification through full-body tracking or facial expressions detection for various tasks such as fall detection and COVID-19 detection, it looks at different methods proposed by each paper, their significance and their results.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the existing literature on how artificial intelligence is being used to support the identification of cephalometric landmarks. The systematic analysis of literature was carried out by performing an extensive search in PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane, Scopus, and Science Direct databases. Articles published in the last ten years were selected after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 17 full-text articles were systematically appraised. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (CHSRI) and Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS) were adopted for quality analysis of the included studies. The artificial intelligence systems were mainly based on deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the included studies. The majority of the studies proposed that AI-based automatic cephalometric analyses provide clinically acceptable diagnostic performance. They have worked remarkably well, with accuracy and precision similar to the trained orthodontist. Moreover, they can simplify cephalometric analysis and provide a quick outcome in practice. Therefore, they are of great benefit to orthodontists, as with these systems they can perform tasks more efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Critically ill neonates are at greater risk for adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The differentiation of ADRs from reactions associated with organ dysfunction/immaturity or genetic variability is difficult.\nIn this prospective cohort study, each ADR was assessed using newborn-specific severity and probability scales by the clinical pharmacist. Subsequently, a machine learning-based risk score was designed to predict ADR presence in neonates.\nIn 98/412 (23.8%) of (56.3%; male) neonates included, 187 ADRs (0.42 ADR/patient) were determined related to 49 different drugs (37.12%). Drugs identified as high risk were enoxaparin, dexmedetomidine, vinblastine, dornase alfa, etoposide/carboplatin and prednisolone. The independent variables included in the risk score to predict ADR presence, according to the random forest importance criterion, were: systemic hormones (2 points), cardiovascular drugs (3 points), diseases of the circulatory system (1 point), nervous system drugs (1 point), and parenteral nutrition treatment (1 point), (cut-off value: 3 points). This risk score correctly classified 91.1% of the observations in the test set (c-index: 0.914).\nUsing the high-performing risk score specific to neonates, it is expected that high-risk neonatal ADRs can be determined and prevented before they occur. Moreover, the awareness of clinicians of these drugs can be improved with this web-tool, and mitigation strategies (change of drug, dose, treatment duration, etc.) can be considered, based on a benefit-harm relationship for suspected drugs with a newborn-centered approach.",

    "abstract": "Emergency Radiology is a unique branch of imaging, as rapidity in the diagnosis and management of different pathologies is essential to saving patients' lives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many potential applications in emergency radiology: firstly, image acquisition can be facilitated by reducing acquisition times through automatic positioning and minimizing artifacts with AI-based reconstruction systems to optimize image quality, even in critical patients; secondly, it enables an efficient workflow (AI algorithms integrated with RIS-PACS workflow), by analyzing the characteristics and images of patients, detecting high-priority examinations and patients with emergent critical findings. Different machine and deep learning algorithms have been trained for the automated detection of different types of emergency disorders (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage, bone fractures, pneumonia), to help radiologists to detect relevant findings. AI-based smart reporting, summarizing patients' clinical data, and analyzing the grading of the imaging abnormalities, can provide an objective indicator of the disease's severity, resulting in quick and optimized treatment planning. In this review, we provide an overview of the different AI tools available in emergency radiology, to keep radiologists up to date on the current technological evolution in this field.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop a deep learning model to automatically detect and segment unobturated mesial buccal 2 (MB2) canals on endodontically obturated maxillary molars depicted in CBCT studies. Fifty-seven deidentified CBCT studies of maxillary molars with clinically confirmed unobturated MB2 canals were retrieved from a dental institution radiology database. One-hundred and two maxillary molar roots with and without unobturated MB2 canals were segmented using ITK-SNAP. The data were split into training and testing samples designated to train and evaluate the performance, respectively, of a convolutional neural network (CNN), U-Net. The detection performance revealed a sensitivity of 0.8, a specificity of 1, a high PPV of 1, and a NPV of 0.83 for the testing set, along with an accuracy of 0.9. The segmentation performance of unobturated MB2 canals, assessed using the custom metric, rendered a mean value of 0.3018 for the testing set. The current AI algorithm has the potential to identify obturated and unobturated canals in endodontically treated teeth. However, the AI algorithm is still somewhat affected by metallic artifacts, variations in canal calcifications, and the applied configuration. Thus, further development is needed to improve the algorithm and validate the accuracy using external validation data sets.",

    "abstract": "Dry eye disease (DED) is one of the most common diseases worldwide that can lead to a significant impairment of quality of life. The diagnosis and treatment of the disease are often challenging because of the lack of correlation between the signs and symptoms, limited reliability of diagnostic tests, and absence of established consensus on the diagnostic criteria. The advancement of machine learning, particularly deep learning technology, has enabled the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in various anterior segment disorders, including DED. Currently, many studies have reported promising results of AI-based algorithms for the accurate diagnosis of DED and precise and reliable assessment of data obtained by imaging devices for DED. Thus, the integration of AI into clinical approaches for DED can enhance diagnostic and therapeutic performance. In this review, in addition to a brief summary of the application of AI in anterior segment diseases, we will provide an overview of studies regarding the application of AI in DED and discuss the recent advances in the integration of AI into the clinical approach for DED.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually being utilized in various fields as its performance has been improving with the development of deep learning methods, availability of big data, and the progression of computer processing units. In the field of medicine, AI is mainly implemented in image recognition, such as in radiographic and pathologic diagnoses. In the realm of gastrointestinal endoscopy, although AI-based computer-assisted detection/diagnosis (CAD) systems have been applied in some areas, such as colorectal polyp detection and diagnosis, so far, their implementation in real-world clinical settings is limited. The accurate detection or diagnosis of gastric cancer (GC) is one of the challenges in which performance varies greatly depending on the endoscopist's skill. The diagnosis of early GC is especially challenging, partly because early GC mimics atrophic gastritis in the background mucosa. Therefore, several CAD systems for GC are being actively developed. The development of a CAD system for GC is considered challenging because it requires a large number of GC images. In particular, early stage GC images are rarely available, partly because it is difficult to diagnose gastric cancer during the early stages. Additionally, the training image data should be of a sufficiently high quality to conduct proper CAD training. Recently, several AI systems for GC that exhibit a robust performance, owing to being trained on a large number of high-quality images, have been reported. This review outlines the current status and prospects of AI use in esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS), focusing on the diagnosis of GC.",

    "abstract": "Markers used in everyday clinical practice cannot distinguish between the permanent impairment of renal function. Sodium and potassium values and their interdependence are key parameters in addition to volemia for the assessment of cardiorenal balance. The aim of this study was to investigate volemia and electrolyte status from a clinical cardiorenal viewpoint under consideration of renal function utilizing artificial intelligence. In this paper, an analysis of five variables: B-type natriuretic peptide, sodium, potassium, ejection fraction, EPI creatinine-cystatin C, was performed using an algorithm based on the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system. B-type natriuretic peptide had the greatest influence on the ejection fraction. It has been shown that values of both Na+ and K+ lead to deterioration of the condition and vital endangerment of patients. To identify the risk of occurrence, the model identifies a prognostic biomarker by random regression from the total data set. The predictions obtained from this model can help optimize preventative strategies and intensive monitoring for patients identified as at risk for electrolyte disturbance and hypervolemia. This approach may be superior to the traditional diagnostic approach due to its contribution to more accurate and rapid diagnostic interpretation and better planning of further patient treatment.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), a rousing advancement disrupting a wide spectrum of applications with remarkable betterment, has continued to gain momentum over the past decades. Within breast imaging, AI, especially machine learning and deep learning, honed with unlimited cross-data/case referencing, has found great utility encompassing four facets: screening and detection, diagnosis, disease monitoring, and data management as a whole. Over the years, breast cancer has been the apex of the cancer cumulative risk ranking for women across the six continents, existing in variegated forms and offering a complicated context in medical decisions. Realizing the ever-increasing demand for quality healthcare, contemporary AI has been envisioned to make great strides in clinical data management and perception, with the capability to detect indeterminate significance, predict prognostication, and correlate available data into a meaningful clinical endpoint. Here, the authors captured the review works over the past decades, focusing on AI in breast imaging, and systematized the included works into one usable document, which is termed an umbrella review. The present study aims to provide a panoramic view of how AI is poised to enhance breast imaging procedures. Evidence-based scientometric analysis was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, resulting in 71 included review works. This study aims to synthesize, collate, and correlate the included review works, thereby identifying the patterns, trends, quality, and types of the included works, captured by the structured search strategy. The present study is intended to serve as a \"one-stop center\" synthesis and provide a holistic bird's eye view to readers, ranging from newcomers to existing researchers and relevant stakeholders, on the topic of interest.",

    "abstract": "Physical ergonomics has established itself as a valid strategy for monitoring potential disorders related, for example, to working activities. Recently, in the field of physical ergonomics, several studies have also shown potential for improvement in experimental methods of ergonomic analysis, through the combined use of artificial intelligence, and wearable sensors. In this regard, this review intends to provide a first account of the investigations carried out using these combined methods, considering the period up to 2021. The method that combines the information obtained on the worker through physical sensors (IMU, accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.) or biopotential sensors (EMG, EEG, EKG/ECG), with the analysis through artificial intelligence systems (machine learning or deep learning), offers interesting perspectives from both diagnostic, prognostic, and preventive points of view. In particular, the signals, obtained from wearable sensors for the recognition and categorization of the postural and biomechanical load of the worker, can be processed to formulate interesting algorithms for applications in the preventive field (especially with respect to musculoskeletal disorders), and with high statistical power. For Ergonomics, but also for Occupational Medicine, these applications improve the knowledge of the limits of the human organism, helping in the definition of sustainability thresholds, and in the ergonomic design of environments, tools, and work organization. The growth prospects for this research area are the refinement of the procedures for the detection and processing of signals; the expansion of the study to assisted working methods (assistive robots, exoskeletons), and to categories of workers suffering from pathologies or disabilities; as well as the development of risk assessment systems that exceed those currently used in ergonomics in precision and agility.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials are the most effective tools to evaluate the advantages of various diagnostic and treatment modalities. AI used in medical issues, including screening, diagnosis, and treatment decisions, improves health outcomes and patient experiences. This study's objective was to investigate the traits of registered trials on artificial intelligence for lung disease. Clinical studies on AI for lung disease that were present in the ClinicalTrials.gov database were searched, and fifty-three registered trials were included. Forty-six (72.1%) were observational trials, compared to seven (27.9%) that were interventional trials. Only eight trials (15.4%) were completed. Thirty (56.6%) trials were accepting applicants. Clinical studies often included a large number of cases; for example, 24 (32.0%) trials included samples of 100-1000 cases, while 14 (17.5%) trials included samples of 1000-2000 cases. Of the interventional trials, twenty (15.7%) were retrospective studies and twenty (65.7%) were prospective studies.",

    "abstract": "Infertility is a global health issue affecting women and men of reproductive age with increasing incidence worldwide, in part due to greater awareness and better diagnosis. Assisted reproduction technologies (ART) are considered the ultimate step in the treatment of infertility. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been progressively used in the many fields of medicine, integrating knowledge and computer science through machine learning algorithms. AI has the potential to improve infertility diagnosis and ART outcomes estimated as pregnancy and/or live birth rate, especially with recurrent ART failure. A broad-ranging review has been conducted, focusing on clinical AI applications up until September 2022, which could be estimated in terms of possible applications, such as ultrasound monitoring of folliculogenesis, endometrial receptivity, embryo selection based on quality and viability, and prediction of post implantation embryo development, in order to eliminate potential contributing risk factors. Oocyte morphology assessment is highly relevant in terms of successful fertilization rate, as well as during oocyte freezing for fertility preservation, and substantially valuable in oocyte donation cycles. AI has great implications in the assessment of male infertility, with computerised semen analysis systems already in use and a broad spectrum of possible AI-based applications in environmental and lifestyle evaluation to predict semen quality. In addition, considerable progress has been made in terms of harnessing AI in cases of idiopathic infertility, to improve the stratification of infertile/fertile couples based on their biological and clinical signatures. With AI as a very powerful tool of the future, our review is meant to summarise current AI applications and investigations in contemporary reproduction medicine, mainly focusing on the nonsurgical aspects of it; in addition, the authors have briefly explored the frames of reference and guiding principles for the definition and implementation of legal, regulatory, and ethical standards for AI in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Substantial milestones have been attained in the field of heart failure (HF) diagnostics and therapeutics in the past several years that have translated into decreased mortality but a paradoxical increase in HF-related hospitalizations. With increasing data digitalization and access, remote monitoring via wearables and implantables have the potential to transform ambulatory care workflow, with a particular focus on reducing HF hospitalizations. Additionally, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) have been increasingly employed at multiple stages of healthcare due to their power in assimilating and integrating multidimensional multimodal data and the creation of accurate prediction models. With the ever-increasing troves of data, the implementation of AI/ML algorithms could help improve workflow and outcomes of HF patients, especially time series data collected via remote monitoring. In this review, we sought to describe the basics of AI/ML algorithms with a focus on time series forecasting and the current state of AI/ML within the context of wearable technology in HF, followed by a discussion of the present limitations, including data integration, privacy, and challenges specific to AI/ML application within healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been shown to solve several issues affecting COVID-19 diagnosis. This systematic review research explores the impact of AI in early COVID-19 screening, detection, and diagnosis. A comprehensive survey of AI in the COVID-19 literature, mainly in the context of screening and diagnosis, was observed by applying the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data sources for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022 were retrieved from google scholar, web of science, Scopus, and PubMed, with target keywords relating to AI in COVID-19 screening and diagnosis. After a comprehensive review of these studies, the results found that AI contributed immensely to improving COVID-19 screening and diagnosis. Some proposed AI models were shown to have comparable (sometimes even better) clinical decision outcomes, compared to experienced radiologists in the screening/diagnosing of COVID-19. Additionally, AI has the capacity to reduce physician work burdens and fatigue and reduce the problems of several false positives, associated with the RT-PCR test (with lower sensitivity of 60-70%) and medical imaging analysis. Even though AI was found to be timesaving and cost-effective, with less clinical errors, it works optimally under the supervision of a physician or other specialists.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), a field of research in which computers are applied to mimic humans, is continuously expanding and influencing many aspects of our lives. From electric cars to search motors, AI helps us manage our daily lives by simplifying functions and activities that would be more complex otherwise. Even in the medical field, and specifically in oncology, many studies in recent years have highlighted the possible helping role that AI could play in clinical and therapeutic patient management. In specific contexts, clinical decisions are supported by \"intelligent\" machines and the development of specific softwares that assist the specialist in the management of the oncology patient. Melanoma, a highly heterogeneous disease influenced by several genetic and environmental factors, to date is still difficult to manage clinically in its advanced stages. Therapies often fail, due to the establishment of intrinsic or secondary resistance, making clinical decisions complex. In this sense, although much work still needs to be conducted, numerous evidence shows that AI (through the processing of large available data) could positively influence the management of the patient with advanced melanoma, helping the clinician in the most favorable therapeutic choice and avoiding unnecessary treatments that are sure to fail. In this review, the most recent applications of AI in melanoma will be described, focusing especially on the possible finding of this field in the management of drug treatments.",

    "abstract": "The early detection and prevention of plant diseases that are an important cause of famine and food insecurity worldwide are very important for increasing agricultural product productivity. Not only the early detection of the plant disease but also the determination of its type play a critical role in determining the appropriate treatment. The fact that visual inspection, which is frequently used in determining plant disease and types, is tiring and prone to human error, necessitated the development of algorithms that can automatically classify plant disease with high accuracy and low computational cost. In this study, a new hybrid plant leaf disease classification model with high accuracy and low computational complexity, consisting of the wrapper approach, including the flower pollination algorithm (FPA) and support vector machine (SVM), and a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, is developed with a wrapper-based feature selection approach using metaheuristic optimization techniques. The features of the image dataset consisting of apple, grape, and tomato plants have been extracted by a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D-DWT) using wavelet families such as biorthogonal, Coiflets, Daubechies, Fejer-Korovkin, and symlets. Features that keep classifier performance high for each family are selected by the wrapper approach, consisting of the population-based metaheuristics FPA and SVM. The performance of the proposed optimization algorithm is compared with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Afterwards, the classification performance is obtained by using the lowest number of features that can keep the classification performance high for the CNN classifier. The CNN classifier with a single layer of classification without a feature extraction layer is used to minimize the complexity of the model and to deal with the model hyperparameter problem. The obtained model is embedded in the NVIDIA Jetson Nano developer kit on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and real-time classification tests are performed on apple, grape, and tomato plants. The experimental results obtained show that the proposed model classifies the specified plant leaf diseases in real time with high accuracy. Moreover, it is concluded that the robust hybrid classification model, which is created by selecting the lowest number of features with the optimization algorithm with low computational complexity, can classify plant leaf diseases in real time with precision.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is growing more prevalent worldwide. Although non-invasive diagnostic approaches such as conventional ultrasonography and clinical scoring systems have been proposed as alternatives to liver biopsy, their efficacy has been called into doubt. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now combined with traditional diagnostic processes to improve the performance of non-invasive approaches.\nThis study explores how well various AI methods function and perform on ultrasound (US) images to diagnose and quantify non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\nA systematic review was conducted to achieve this objective. Five science bibliographic databases were searched, including PubMed, Association for Computing Machinery ACM Digital Library, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Only peer-reviewed English articles, conferences, theses, and book chapters were included. Data from studies were synthesized using narrative methodologies per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria.\nForty-nine studies were included in the systematic review. According to the qualitative analysis, AI significantly enhanced the diagnosis of NAFLD, Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), and liver fibrosis. In addition, modalities, image acquisition, feature extraction and selection, data management, and classifiers were assessed and compared in terms of performance measures (i.e., accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity).\nAI-supported systems show potential performance increases in detecting and quantifying steatosis, NASH, and liver fibrosis in NAFLD patients. Before real-world implementation, prospective studies with direct comparisons of AI-assisted modalities and conventional techniques are necessary.",

    "abstract": "This paper uses bibliometrics to characterize the knowledge systems of big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and energy based on the Science Citation Index Extension (SCI-E) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) of the Web of Science from 2001 to 2020. Results show that China is the country with the highest number of publications (1115), accounting for 29% of the total; however, the most influential country in the field is the USA, with an h-index of 75. The Chinese Academy of Sciences publishes the largest number of papers (104) and plays a vital role in the collaboration network. The study also reveals that the IEEE Access is the most productive journal (195) in terms of the number of publications, and engineering is the most popular discipline (1526). The key theoretical foundation includes deep learning (293), big data (105), energy consumption (79), and reinforcement learning (40). The application of big data and AI in the field of energy focuses on smart grid, energy consumption, and renewable energy. Early research frontiers involve optimization and prediction of energy-related problems using the genetic algorithm and neural networks. Since 2013, energy big data have gained prominence. At present, machine learning, deep learning, and fog computing are frequently combined with energy saving. In the future, big data and AI will be utilized to promote the application of renewable energy and energy-saving renovation of buildings. These findings can help researchers understand the developmental trends and correctly grasp the research direction and method of the emerging interdisciplinary field.",

    "abstract": "The length of stay (LOS) in hospital is one of the main parameters for evaluating the management of a health facility, of its departments in relation to the different specializations. Healthcare costs are in fact closely linked to this parameter as well as the profit margin. In the orthopedic field, the provision of this parameter is increasingly complex and of fundamental importance in order to be able to evaluate the planning of resources, the waiting times for any scheduled interventions and the management of the department and related surgical interventions. The purpose of this work is to predict and evaluate the LOS value using machine learning methods and applying multiple linear regression, starting from clinical data of patients hospitalized with lower limb fractures. The data were collected at the \"San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi d'Aragona\" hospital in Salerno (Italy).",

    "abstract": "We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) technique to identify epileptic discharges (spikes) in pediatric scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs). We built a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to automatically classify steep potential images into spikes and background activity. For the CNN model' training and validation, we examined 100 children with spikes in EEGs and another 100 without spikes. A different group of 20 children with spikes and 20 without spikes were the actual test subjects. All subjects were \u2265 3 to < 18 years old. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the analysis were >0.97 when referential and combination EEG montages were used, and < 0.97 with a bipolar montage. The correct classification of background activity in individual patients was significantly better with a referential montage than with a bipolar montage (p=0.0107). Receiver operating characteristic curves yielded an area under the curve > 0.99, indicating high performance of the classification method. EEG patterns that interfered with correct classification included vertex sharp transients, sleep spindles, alpha rhythm, and low-amplitude ill-formed spikes in a run. Our results demonstrate that AI is a promising tool for automatically interpreting pediatric EEGs. Some avenues for improving the technique were also indicated by our findings.",

    "abstract": "To optimize artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate Scheimpflug-based corneal tomography and biomechanics to enhance ectasia detection.\nMulticenter cross-sectional case-control retrospective study.\nA total of 3886 unoperated eyes from 3412 patients had Pentacam and Corvis ST (Oculus Optikger\u00e4te GmbH) examinations. The database included 1 eye randomly selected from 1680 normal patients (N) and from 1181 \"bilateral\" keratoconus (KC) patients, along with 551 normal topography eyes from patients with very asymmetric ectasia (VAE-NT), and their 474 unoperated ectatic (VAE-E) eyes. The current TBIv1 (tomographic-biomechanical index) was tested, and an optimized AI algorithm was developed for augmenting accuracy.\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the TBIv1 for discriminating clinical ectasia (KC and VAE-E) was 0.999 (98.5% sensitivity; 98.6% specificity [cutoff: 0.5]), and for VAE-NT, 0.899 (76% sensitivity; 89.1% specificity [cutoff: 0.29]). A novel random forest algorithm (TBIv2), developed with 18 features in 156 trees using 10-fold cross-validation, had a significantly higher AUC (0.945; DeLong, P < .0001) for detecting VAE-NT (84.4% sensitivity and 90.1% specificity; cutoff: 0.43; DeLong, P < .0001) and a similar AUC for clinical ectasia (0.999; DeLong, P\u00a0=\u00a0.818; 98.7% sensitivity; 99.2% specificity [cutoff: 0.8]). Considering all cases, the TBIv2 had a higher AUC (0.985) than TBIv1 (0.974; DeLong, P < .0001).\nAI optimization to integrate Scheimpflug-based corneal tomography and biomechanical assessments augments accuracy for ectasia detection, characterizing ectasia susceptibility in the diverse VAE-NT group. Some patients with VAE may have true unilateral ectasia. Machine learning considering additional data, including epithelial thickness or other parameters from multimodal refractive imaging, will continuously enhance accuracy.

    "abstract": "To assess the efficiency of AI methods in finding radiographic features in Endodontic treatment considerations.\nThis review was based on the PRISMA guidelines and QUADAS 2 tool. A systematic search was performed of the literature on cases with endodontic treatments, comparing AI algorithms (test) versus conventional image assessments (control) for finding radiographic features. The search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and the Cochrane library. Inclusion criteria were studies on the use of AI and machine learning in endodontic treatments using dental X-rays.\nThe initial search retrieved 1131 papers, from which 24 were included. High heterogeneity of the materials left out a meta-analysis. The reported subcategories were periapical lesion, vertical root fractures, predicting root/canal morphology, locating minor apical foramen, tooth segmentation and endodontic retreatment prediction. Radiographic features assessed were mostly periapical lesions. The studies mostly considered the decision of 1-3 experts as the reference for training their models. Almost half of the included materials campared their trained neural network model with other methods. More than 58% of studies had some level of bias.\nAI-based models have shown effectiveness in finding radiographic features in different endodontic treatments. While the reported accuracy measurements seem promising, the papers mostly were biased methodologically.",

    "abstract": "A framework that extracts oncological outcomes from large-scale databases using artificial intelligence (AI) is not well established. Thus, we aimed to develop AI models to extract outcomes in patients with lung cancer using unstructured text data from electronic health records of multiple hospitals.\nWe constructed AI models (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT], Na\u00efve Bayes, and Longformer) for tumor evaluation using the University of Miyazaki Hospital (UMH) database. This data included both structured and unstructured data from progress notes, radiology reports, and discharge summaries. The BERT model was applied to the Life Data Initiative (LDI) data\u00a0set of six hospitals. Study outcomes included the performance of AI models and time to progression of disease (TTP) for each line of treatment based on the treatment response extracted by AI models.\nFor the UMH data\u00a0set, the BERT model exhibited higher precision accuracy compared to the Na\u00efve Bayes or the Longformer models, respectively (precision [0.42 vs. 0.47 or 0.22], recall [0.63 vs. 0.46 or 0.33] and F1 scores [0.50 vs. 0.46 or 0.27]). When this BERT model was applied to LDI data, prediction accuracy remained quite similar. The Kaplan-Meier plots of TTP (months) showed similar trends for the first (median 14.9 [95% confidence interval 11.5, 21.1] and 16.8 [12.6, 21.8]), the second (7.8 [6.7, 10.7] and 7.8 [6.7, 10.7]), and the later lines of treatment for the predicted data by the BERT model and the manually curated data.\nWe developed AI models to extract treatment responses in patients with lung cancer using a large EHR database; however, the model requires further improvement.\nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI) to derive health outcomes from large electronic health records is not well established. Thus, we built three different AI models: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Na\u00efve Bayes, and Longformer to serve this purpose. Initially, we developed these models based on data from the University of Miyazaki Hospital (UMH) and later improved them using the Life Data Initiative (LDI) data\u00a0set of six hospitals. The performance of the BERT model was better than the other two, and it showed similar results when it was applied to the LDI data\u00a0set. The Kaplan\u2013Meier plots of time to progression of disease for the predicted data by the BERT model showed similar trends to those for the manually curated data. In summary, we developed an AI model to extract health outcomes using a large electronic health database in this study; however, the performance of the AI model could be improved using more training data.",

    "abstract": "With its robust ability to integrate and learn from large sets of clinical data, artificial intelligence (AI) can now play a role in diagnosis,\u00a0clinical decision making, and personalized medicine. It is probably the natural progression of traditional statistical techniques. Currently, there are many unmet needs in nephrology and, more particularly, in the kidney transplantation (KT) field. The complexity and increase in the amount of data, and the multitude of nephrology registries worldwide have enabled the explosive use of AI within the field. Nephrologists in many countries are already at the center of experiments and advances in this cutting-edge technology and our aim is to generalize the use of AI among nephrologists worldwide. In this paper, we provide an overview of AI from a medical perspective. We cover the core concepts of AI relevant to the practicing nephrologist in a consistent and simple way to help them get started, and we discuss the technical challenges. Finally, we focus on the KT field: the unmet needs and the potential role that AI can play to fill these gaps, then we summarize the published KT-related studies, including predictive factors used in each study, which will allow researchers to quickly focus on the most relevant issues.",

    "abstract": "The main purpose of modern intelligence tests has been to predict individual differences in academic performance, first of children, then adolescents, and later extending to adults. From the earliest Binet-Simon scales to current times, most one-on-one omnibus intelligence assessments include both process subtests (e.g., memory, reasoning) and content subtests (e.g., vocabulary, information). As somewhat parallel developments, intelligence theorists have argued about the primacy of the process components or the content components reflecting intelligence, with many modern researchers proposing that process constructs like working memory are the fundamental determinant of individual differences in intelligence. To address whether there is an adequate basis for re-configuring intelligence assessments from content or mixed content and process measures to all-process measures, the question to be answered in this paper is whether intellectual process assessments are more or less valid predictors of academic success, in comparison to content measures. A brief review of the history of intelligence assessment is provided with respect to these issues, and a number of problems and limitations of process measures is discussed. In the final analysis, there is insufficient justification for using process-only measures to the exclusion of content measures, and the limited data available point to the idea that content-dominated measures are more highly predictive of academic success than are process measures.",

    "abstract": "The concept of intelligence has been extensively studied, undergoing an evolution from a unitary concept to a more elaborate and complex multidimensional one. In addition, several research studies have focused their efforts for decades on the study of intelligence as a predictor of academic performance of students at different educational stages, being a stable and highly relevant predictor along with other variables such as executive functions, social context, culture or parental guardianship. Thus, the present study, based on a systematic review and meta-analysis, includes 27 studies with a total sample of 42,061 individuals. The main objective was to analyse the relationship between intelligence and academic performance using different predictive models that include moderating variables such as country of origin, type of intelligence, gender and age. The findings of this research highlight the significant, positive and moderate relationship between intelligence and academic performance (r = 0.367; p < 0.001), highlighting the predictive capacity on school performance when the type of intelligence (general and implicit; 35%) or the country of origin (45%) is taken as a moderating variable, with the explanatory models on age or sex not being significant. Therefore, it can be concluded that intelligence, in addition to being a good predictor of academic performance, is influenced depending on the type of intelligence or theoretical model taken as a reference, and also depending on the country or culture of origin.",

    "abstract": "Aurora Battery is a corresponding test of successful intelligence. This study aims to examine the factorial structure of the Chinese version of Aurora Battery and to investigate its internal consistency and validity, as well as to discover the developmental features of Chinese students. A total number of 2007 students were recruited from 13 schools across eastern, central, and western China, ranging from 4th to 8th grade (mean age = 12.29 years) and among them, 43.9% are girls. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine the factorial structure. Among the tested models, a second-order factor model, in which the three ability factors serve as indicators of a general factor, provided an acceptable model fit to the data. Moreover, measurement invariance across gender and grades were supported, which suggests the mean scores of analytical, creative, and practical abilities are comparable in this research. The criterion-related validity analysis suggests that the battery and its three subscales have good criterion validity. The scale reliability analysis shows that the Cronbach's alpha and the McDonald's omega value of the whole test were .84 and .87, respectively, indicating the scale's internal reliability is good. For ability differences among grades, students' analytical and practical abilities increase across all grades, while creativity presents an upward trend from grade 4 to 6, followed by a downward trend from grade 6 to 7, and an increase from grade 7 to 8. Female students outperform male students on both analytical and creative ability, while with no obvious difference on practical abilities.",

    "abstract": "Intelligence, like creativity and wisdom, has an attitudinal component as well as an ability-based one. The attitudinal component is at least as important as the ability-based one. Theories of intelligence, in ignoring the attitudinal component of intelligence, have failed to account fully or accurately for why so many people who have relatively high levels of intelligence as an ability fail fully to deploy their ability, especially toward positive ends. The article reviews the need to view intelligence as comprising an attitude as well as an ability, and surveys reasons why people's lack of an intelligent attitude hinders their deployment of intelligence. Suggestions are made for how things could change in a positive way.",

    "abstract": "Creativity incorporates both domain-general and domain-specific ideas. While previous studies have explored the impact of emotional intelligence (EI) on creativity in both domains, a consensus has not been reached, and the mechanism is currently unclear. In the present study, we examined which aspect of creativity EI was most strongly associated with in a group of undergraduates. Moreover, we explored the moderated mediation effect between EI and domain-specific creativity. In Study 1, 532 undergraduates completed questionnaires measuring EI, convergent and divergent creative thinking, and creative achievement. The results revealed that the most reliable positive correlations were between EI and domain-specific creativity. In Study 2, 926 undergraduates completed measurements of EI, resilience, gratitude, and creative achievement. The results revealed that resilience mediates the relationship between EI and creative achievement. Furthermore, gratitude moderated the indirect effect of EI on creative achievement through resilience. The indirect effect of EI on creative achievement was stronger for high-gratitude individuals than for low-gratitude individuals. This orientation and other results are discussed. Overall, our findings add further nuance to the relationship between EI and creativity in different domains. This study serves as a basis for other contributions aligned with these concepts.",

    "abstract": "Advances in Artificial intelligence (AI) and embedded systems have resulted on a recent increase in use of image processing applications for smart cities' safety. This enables a cost-adequate scale of automated video surveillance, increasing the data available and releasing human intervention. At the same time, although deep learning is a very intensive task in terms of computing resources, hardware and software improvements have emerged, allowing embedded systems to implement sophisticated machine learning algorithms at the edge. Additionally, new lightweight open-source middleware for constrained resource devices, such as EdgeX Foundry, have appeared to facilitate the collection and processing of data at sensor level, with communication capabilities to exchange data with a cloud enterprise application. The objective of this work is to show and describe the development of two Edge Smart Camera Systems for safety of Smart cities within S4AllCities H2020 project. Hence, the work presents hardware and software modules developed within the project, including a custom hardware platform specifically developed for the deployment of deep learning models based on the I.MX8 Plus from NXP, which considerably reduces processing and inference times; a custom Video Analytics Edge Computing (VAEC) system deployed on a commercial NVIDIA Jetson TX2 platform, which provides high level results on person detection processes; and an edge computing framework for the management of those two edge devices, namely Distributed Edge Computing framework, DECIoT. To verify the utility and functionality of the systems, extended experiments were performed. The results highlight their potential to provide enhanced situational awareness and demonstrate the suitability for edge machine vision applications for safety in smart cities.",

    "abstract": "The smoking behaviour of patients following a cancer diagnosis is a critical risk factor for several physical diseases; it can increase the risk of second primary tumors and lower cancer treatment efficacy. Despite this, a great number of survivors continue to smoke after the diagnosis. This observational, cross-sectional on-line study aimed to assess the relationship between the impact of cancer diagnosis on survivors and their smoking behavior, and whether emotional intelligence and personality might mediate this relationship. Ninety-four Italian survivors completed a set of questionnaires: ",

We developed an AI-based novel predictive LOS score for advanced-stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients following cytoreductive surgery and refined factors significantly affecting LOS. (2) Methods: Machine learning and deep learning methods using artificial neural networks (ANN) were used together with conventional logistic regression to predict continuous and binary LOS outcomes for HGSOC patients. The models were evaluated in a post-hoc internal validation set and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of sophisticated LOS predictions. (3) Results: For binary LOS predictions at differential time points, the accuracy ranged between 70-98%. Feature selection identified surgical complexity, pre-surgery albumin, blood loss, operative time, bowel resection with stoma formation, and severe postoperative complications (CD3-5) as independent LOS predictors. For the GUI numerical LOS score, the ANN model was a good estimator for the standard deviation of the LOS distribution by \u00b1 two days. (4) Conclusions: We demonstrated the development and application of both quantitative and qualitative AI models to predict LOS in advanced-stage EOC patients following their cytoreduction. Accurate identification of potentially modifiable factors delaying hospital discharge can further inform services performing root cause analysis of LOS.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: As they are satisfied with life, nurses who demonstrate spiritual intelligence and well-being at work are tremendous assets to an organisation. This study aimed to determine the mediating effect of spiritual intelligence on the well-being and life satisfaction of nurses in the context of COVID-19. Methods: This research employed a cross-sectional study design. It was conducted in the Hail region of Saudi Arabia. The participants were government hospital nurses who were chosen using a multi-stage sampling method. A total of 1121 (75% response rate) nurses participated in the study. Data gathering was conducted from July to September 2022. Results: The life satisfaction level of the participants was deemed positive. Their well-being was better (10/15), and they rated high in spiritual intelligence (90/120). Life satisfaction had a strong association with well-being (r = 0.640, p < 0.001), but a weak association with spiritual intelligence (r = 0.391, p < 0.001). In comparison, well-being had a moderate association with spiritual intelligence (r = 0.551, p < 0.001). The direct effect of well-being on spiritual intelligence was positive and significant (\u03b2 = 0.7817, p < 0.0001), and that of spiritual intelligence on life satisfaction was positive and significant (\u03b2 = 0.1082, p = 0.0257). The direct effect of well-being on life satisfaction was also positive and significant (\u03b2 = 1.5985, p < 0.0001). Conversely, well-being had an indirect impact on life satisfaction (\u03b2 = 0.0846), and this effect was significant. Overall, the impact of well-being on life satisfaction was positive and significant (\u03b2 = 1.6831, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: The nurses in this study were deemed satisfied, to have better well-being, and better spiritual intelligence. Life satisfaction has a strong association with well-being but a weak one with spiritual intelligence, while well-being has a moderate association with spiritual intelligence. Overall, spiritual intelligence was found to have a mediating effect on the relationship between well-being and life satisfaction. These findings suggest that an increase in spiritual growth can serve as the foundation for people to live better and more integrated lives.",

    "abstract": "The significance of emotions in the classroom has been thoroughly explored, but discussions on educators' abilities to recognize, regulate, and manage their emotions are still ongoing. This paper aims to look at the concept of emotional intelligence (EI) and how professors in higher education can use it to achieve better results in the form of emotional intelligence competencies (EIC). A total of 312 educators from 25 higher education institutes in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) participated in this study. In sampling the Emotional Intelligence Competencies for this study, we adopted Costa and Faria's (2015) EQ test, administered to the respondent. The Reuven Bar-On emotional intelligence scale was created and standardized to gather data. Using structural equation modeling, the validity and utility of a proposed model for EI-based teaching competencies and their relationship to critical strengths were evaluated (SEM). The findings show that EIC significantly impacts educator behavior, which in turn improves student success. In order to ensure successful instruction and remarkable performance, the study provides valuable recommendations to higher education institutes about the importance of recruiting new instructors with high skills in EI and providing training sessions for existing educators to improve their EI skills.",

    "abstract": "Power output from the PV module changes continuously with time depending upon the climatic condition. This changes are most important in tropical area like Senegal due to the variation of the seasons (dry and rainy). Furthermore, different types of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm are presented in literature in order to get maximum output from the PV system. They can be summarized in two categories: classical and intelligent methods. The classical methods in no uniform weather condition are not efficient and an important loss of energy is showed. However, faced to this problematics like energy loss and no uniform weather conditions an Adaptative methods is used to optimize the PVs energy. In this study, two intelligent controllers based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are proposed to optimize the PVs production in non-uniform weather conditions and compared in order to show the most powerful model. For the ANN, the main challenge is to find the optimal neural in the hidden layer and in the paper, it is obtained using evaluator factor like mean squared error (MSE). These techniques using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are used for power optimization of a photovoltaic system are trained and validated with real data from a photovoltaic micro power plant in dry and rainy season installed at polytechnic high school of Dakar. The performances of the controllers to optimize the PVs power are evaluated during the dry and rainy seasons. Simulation results show that the ANFIS MPPT controller is more efficient and robust than ANN in non-uniform weather conditions. They have the ability of generalization and adaption to each meteorological conditions. These bullet summarize the applied methodology\u2022A real electrical characteristics of photovoltaic panel are used for learning and validation of the controllers.\u2022A comparative study of the methods in two different season is done.\u2022ANFIS gives best performance in weather conditions compared to the ANN.",

    "abstract": "Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has shown potential clinical utility in a wide range of MRI fields. In particular, AI models for improving the efficiency of the image acquisition process and the quality of reconstructed images are being actively developed by the MR research community. AI is expected to further reduce acquisition times in various MRI protocols used in clinical practice when compared to current parallel imaging techniques. Additionally, AI can help with tasks such as planning, parameter optimization, artifact reduction, and quality assessment. Furthermore, AI is being actively applied to automate MR image analysis such as image registration, segmentation, and object detection. For this reason, it is important to consider the effects of protocols or devices in MR image analysis. In this review article, we briefly introduced issues related to AI application of MR image acquisition and reconstruction.\n\ucd5c\uadfc \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc790\uae30\uacf5\uba85\uc601\uc0c1(\uc774\ud558 MRI)\uc758 \ud3ed\ub113\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1\uc801 \ud65c\uc6a9\uac00\uce58\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, MRI\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uc0c1\ud68d\ub4dd\uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub41c \uc601\uc0c1\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \ud65c\ubc1c\ud558\ub2e4. \uc784\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud65c\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c MRI \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc740 \ubcd1\ub82c\uc601\uc0c1\uae30\ubc95\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uac00\uc18d\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95 \ub300\ube44 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc601\uc0c1\ud68d\ub4dd\uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud574\uc904 \uc218 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ub41c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ud384\uc2a4\uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ub514\uc790\uc778, \uc601\uc0c1\uc758 \uc778\uacf5\ubb3c \uac10\uc18c, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud488\uc9c8\ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub4e4\uc774 \uc18c\uac1c\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc601\uc0c1\ubd84\uc11d \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc7a5\ube44 \ubc0f \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc904\uc5ec\uc904 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc885\uc124\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MRI \uc601\uc0c1\uc758 \ud68d\ub4dd \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uadfc \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uae30\uc220\ub4e4\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ubd84\uc57c \ubc0f \ud574\ub2f9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uae30\uc220\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c \ubc0f \uc801\uc6a9\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud604\uc548\ub4e4\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.",

However, most artificial intelligence technologies are developed so that one model can perform only one task, which is a limitation in designing the complex reading process of doctors with artificial intelligence. Multi-task learning is an optimal way to overcome the limitations of single-task learning methods. Multi-task learning can create a model that is efficient and advantageous for generalization by simultaneously integrating various tasks into one model. This study investigated the concepts, types, and similar concepts as multi-task learning, and examined the status and future possibilities of multi-task learning in the medical research.\n\ucd5c\uadfc, \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uba70 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\uc220\ub4e4\uc740 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\ub9cc\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud310\ub3c5 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294\ub370 \ud55c\uacc4\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uba40\ud2f0 \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ubc29\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\ub4e4\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc885\uc124\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0 \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\ub150\uacfc \uc885\ub958, \uc720\uc0ac \uac1c\ub150 \ub4f1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc54c\uc544\ubcf4\uace0, \uc5f0\uad6c \uc0ac\ub840\ub4e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uba40\ud2f0 \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9 \ud604\ud669\uacfc \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.",

    "abstract": "Structured Medication Reviews (SMRs) are intended to help deliver the NHS Long Term Plan for medicines optimisation in people living with multiple long-term conditions and polypharmacy. It is challenging to gather the information needed for these reviews due to poor integration of health records across providers and there is little guidance on how to identify those patients most urgently requiring review.\nTo extract information from scattered clinical records on how health and medications change over time, apply interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to predict risks of poor outcomes and overlay this information on care records to inform SMRs. We will pilot this approach in primary care prescribing audit and feedback systems, and co-design future medicines optimisation decision support systems.\nDynAIRx will target potentially problematic polypharmacy in three key multimorbidity groups, namely, people with (a) mental and physical health problems, (b) four or more long-term conditions taking ten or more drugs and (c) older age and frailty. Structured clinical data will be drawn from integrated care records (general practice, hospital, and social care) covering an \u223c11m population supplemented with Natural Language Processing (NLP) of unstructured clinical text. AI systems will be trained to identify patterns of conditions, medications, tests, and clinical contacts preceding adverse events in order to identify individuals who might benefit most from an SMR.\nBy implementing and evaluating an AI-augmented visualisation of care records in an existing prescribing audit and feedback system we will create a learning system for medicines optimisation, co-designed throughout with end-users and patients.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the utility of combination of CD138/MUM1 dual-staining (DS) and artificial intelligence (AI) for plasma cell (PC) counting in the diagnosis of chronic endometritis (CE).\nTwo hundred ninety-eight infertile women underwent endometrial biopsy were included. In 100 women, three successive\u00a0sections were cut from each paraffin-embedded tissue block for CD138 immunohistochemical (IHC) single-staining (SS), MUM1 SS and CD138/MUM1 DS. The prevalence of CE and the sensitivity/specificity in the diagnosis of CE with different methods was studied. These sections diagnosed as CE with DS were collected to train artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic system. In other 198 women, their tissue sections stained with CD138/MUM1 DS were used to test the AI system in the diagnosis of CE.\nCD138/MUM1 DS revealed that the cell membranes and nuclei of PCs were simultaneously labelled by CD138 and MUM1, respectively. The positive rate of ECs identified by CD138/MUM1 DS (38%, 38/100) was lower than CD138 SS (52%, 52/100) and MUM1 SS (62%, 62/100) (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CD138/MUM1 DS in the diagnosis of ECs reached 100%. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy rates of AI diagnostic system of ECs were 100%, 83.3% and 91.4%, respectively. The 17 cases over-diagnosed as EC with the AI were corrected quickly by pathologists reviewing these false PC pictures listed by the AI.\nThe combination of CD138/MUM1 DS and AI is a promising method to improve the accuracy and efficiency of CE diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a common condition among cancer patients, across several points in the disease trajectory. Although presenting higher prevalence rates than the general population, it is often not reported or remains unnoticed. Moreover, somatic symptoms of depression are common in the oncological context and should not be dismissed as a general symptom of cancer. It becomes even more challenging to track psychological distress in the period after the treatment, where connection with the healthcare system typically becomes sporadic. The main goal of the FAITH project is to remotely identify and predict depressive symptoms in cancer survivors, based on a federated machine learning (ML) approach, towards optimization of privacy.\nFAITH will remotely analyse depression markers, predicting their negative trends. These markers will be treated in distinct categories, namely\u00a0nutrition, sleep, activity and voice, assessed in part through wearable technologies. The study will include 300 patients who have had a previous diagnosis of breast or lung cancer\u00a0and will be recruited 1 to 5\u00a0years after the end of primary cancer. The study will be organized as\u00a0a 12-month longitudinal prospective observational cohort study, with monthly assessments to evaluate depression symptoms and quality of life among cancer survivors.\u00a0The primary endpoint is the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) at months 3, 6, 9 and 12. Secondary outcomes include\u00a0self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms (HADS scale), and perceived quality of life (EORTC questionnaires), at baseline and monthly. Based on the predictive models gathered during the study, FAITH will also aim at further developing a conceptual federated learning framework,\u00a0enabling to build machine learning\u00a0models for the prediction and monitoring of depression\u00a0without direct access to user's\u00a0personal\u00a0data.\nImprovements in the objectivity of psychiatric assessment are necessary. Wearable technologies can provide potential indicators of depression and anxiety and be used for biofeedback. If the FAITH application is effective, it will provide healthcare systems with a novel and innovative method to screen depressive symptoms in oncological settings.\nTrial ID: ISRCTN10423782 .

    "abstract": "To determine whether an artificial intelligence candidate could pass the rapid (radiographic) reporting component of the Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) examination.\nProspective multi-reader diagnostic accuracy study.\nUnited Kingdom.\nOne artificial intelligence candidate (Smarturgences, Milvue) and 26 radiologists who had passed the FRCR examination in the preceding 12 months.\nAccuracy and pass rate of the artificial intelligence compared with radiologists across 10 mock FRCR rapid reporting examinations (each examination containing 30 radiographs, requiring 90% accuracy rate to pass).\nWhen non-interpretable images were excluded from the analysis, the artificial intelligence candidate achieved an average overall accuracy of 79.5% (95% confidence interval 74.1% to 84.3%) and passed two of 10 mock FRCR examinations. The average radiologist achieved an average accuracy of 84.8% (76.1-91.9%) and passed four of 10 mock examinations. The sensitivity for the artificial intelligence was 83.6% (95% confidence interval 76.2% to 89.4%) and the specificity was 75.2% (66.7% to 82.5%), compared with summary estimates across all radiologists of 84.1% (81.0% to 87.0%) and 87.3% (85.0% to 89.3%). Across 148/300 radiographs that were correctly interpreted by >90% of radiologists, the artificial intelligence candidate was incorrect in 14/148 (9%). In 20/300 radiographs that most (>50%) radiologists interpreted incorrectly, the artificial intelligence candidate was correct in 10/20 (50%). Most imaging pitfalls related to interpretation of musculoskeletal rather than chest radiographs.\nWhen special dispensation for the artificial intelligence candidate was provided (that is, exclusion of non-interpretable images), the artificial intelligence candidate was able to pass two of 10 mock examinations. Potential exists for the artificial intelligence candidate to improve its radiographic interpretation skills by focusing on musculoskeletal cases and learning to interpret radiographs of the axial skeleton and abdomen that are currently considered \"non-interpretable.\"",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the practice of medicine. Systems assessing chest radiographs, pathology slides, and early warning systems embedded in electronic health records (EHRs) are becoming ubiquitous in medical practice. Despite this, medical students have minimal exposure to the concepts necessary to utilize and evaluate AI systems, leaving them under prepared for future clinical practice. We must work quickly to bolster undergraduate medical education around AI to remedy this. In this commentary, we propose that medical educators treat AI as a critical component of medical practice that is introduced early and integrated with the other core components of medical school curricula. Equipping graduating medical students with this knowledge will ensure they have the skills to solve challenges arising at the confluence of AI and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Emerging infections are a continual threat to public health security, which can be improved by use of rapid epidemic intelligence and open-source data. Artificial intelligence systems to enable earlier detection and\u00a0rapid response by governments and health can feasibly mitigate health and economic impacts of serious epidemics and pandemics. EPIWATCH is an artificial intelligence-driven outbreak early-detection and monitoring system, proven to provide early signals of epidemics before official detection by health authorities.",

    "abstract": "Fibro-Scope is an artificial intelligence/neural network system to determine the fibrosis stage in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) using 12 parameters of the patient: age, sex, height, weight, waist circumference (WC), platelet count, and the levels of aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, cholesterol, triglycerides, and type IV collagen 7S. However, measurement of WC is unstable and often missing from patient databases. Herein, we created Fibro-Scope V1.0.1 that has the same detection power as its predecessor, without the need to consider WC.\nTo build a new AI diagnostic system available for the global needs, data from 764 patients with NASH and bridging fibrosis (STELLAR-3) or compensated cirrhosis (STELLAR-4) that participated in two phase III trials were added to the Japanese data. Finally, the data of a total of 898 patients in the training and of 300 patients in the validation studies were analyzed, respectively.\nThe discrimination of F0-2 from F3,4 through Fibro-Scope V1.0.1 was characterized by a 99.8% sensitivity, a 99.6% specificity, a 99.8% positive predictive value, and a 99.6% negative predictive value in a training study with gray zone analysis; similar effectiveness was also revealed in the analysis without a gray zone. In the validation studies with and without gray zone analysis, high sensitivity and specificity were also identified. Fibro-Scope V1.0.1 exerted a diagnostic accuracy for F3,4 advanced fibrosis that was comparable to that of the original Fibro-Scope and delivered high (>\u200992%) sensitivity and specificity.\nFibro-Scope V1.0.1 can accurately diagnose F3,4 fibrosis without the need of WC.",

    "abstract": "Publicly accessible benchmarks that allow for assessing and comparing model performances are important drivers of progress in artificial intelligence (AI). While recent advances in AI capabilities hold the potential to transform medical practice by assisting and augmenting the cognitive processes of healthcare professionals, the coverage of clinically relevant tasks by AI benchmarks is largely unclear. Furthermore, there is a lack of systematized meta-information that allows clinical AI researchers to quickly determine accessibility, scope, content and other characteristics of datasets and benchmark datasets relevant to the clinical domain. To address these issues, we curated and released a comprehensive catalogue of datasets and benchmarks pertaining to the broad domain of clinical and biomedical natural language processing (NLP), based on a systematic review of literature and. A total of 450 NLP datasets were manually systematized and annotated with rich metadata, such as targeted tasks, clinical applicability, data types, performance metrics, accessibility and licensing information, and availability of data splits. We then compared tasks covered by AI benchmark datasets with relevant tasks that medical practitioners reported as highly desirable targets for automation in a previous empirical study. Our analysis indicates that AI benchmarks of direct clinical relevance are scarce and fail to cover most work activities that clinicians want to see addressed. In particular, tasks associated with routine documentation and patient data administration workflows are not represented despite significant associated workloads. Thus, currently available AI benchmarks are improperly aligned with desired targets for AI automation in clinical settings, and novel benchmarks should be created to fill these gaps.",

    "abstract": "Anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) offers several merits such as better digestibility and process stability while enhancing methane yield due to synergistic effects. Operation of an efficient AcoD system, however, requires full comprehension of important operational parameters, such as co-substrates ratio, their composition, volatile fatty acids/alkalinity ratio, organic loading rate, and solids/hydraulic retention time. AcoD process optimization, prediction and control, and early detection of system instability are often difficult to achieve through tedious manual monitoring processes. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as an innovative approach to computational modeling and optimization of the AcoD process. This review discusses AI applications in AcoD process optimization, control, prediction of unknown input/output parameters, and real-time monitoring. Furthermore, the review also compares standalone and hybrid AI algorithms as applied to AcoD. The review highlights future research directions for data preprocessing, model interpretation and validation, and grey-box modeling in AcoD process.",

    "abstract": "Central to modern neuroscientific theories of human intelligence is the notion that general intelligence depends on a primary brain region or network, engaging spatially localized (rather than global) neural representations. Recent findings in network neuroscience, however, challenge this assumption, providing evidence that general intelligence may depend on system-wide network mechanisms, suggesting that local representations are necessary but not sufficient to account for the neural architecture of human intelligence. Despite the importance of this key theoretical distinction, prior research has not systematically investigated the role of local versus global neural representations in predicting general intelligence. We conducted a large-scale connectome-based predictive modeling study (N\u00a0=\u2009297), administering resting-state fMRI and a comprehensive cognitive battery to evaluate the efficacy of modern neuroscientific theories of human intelligence, including spatially localized theories (Lateral Prefrontal Cortex Theory, Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory, and Multiple Demand Theory) and recent global accounts (Process Overlap Theory and Network Neuroscience Theory). The results of our study demonstrate that general intelligence can be predicted by local functional connectivity profiles but is most robustly explained by global profiles of whole-brain connectivity. Our findings further suggest that the improved efficacy of global theories is not reducible to a greater strength or number of connections, but instead results from considering both strong and weak connections that provide the basis for intelligence (as predicted by the Network Neuroscience Theory). Our results highlight the importance of considering local neural representations in the context of a global information-processing architecture, suggesting future directions for theory-driven research on system-wide network mechanisms underlying general intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Care during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium are fundamental to avoid pathologies for the mother and her baby. However, health issues can occur during this period, causing misfortunes, such as the death of the fetus or neonate. Predictive models of fetal and infant deaths are important technological tools that can help to reduce mortality indexes. The main goal of this work is to present a systematic review of literature focused on computational models to predict mortality, covering stillbirth, perinatal, neonatal, and infant deaths, highlighting their methodology and the description of the proposed computational models.\nWe conducted a systematic review of literature, limiting the search to the last 10 years of publications considering the five main scientific databases as source.\nFrom 671 works, 18 of them were selected as primary studies for further analysis. We found that most of works are focused on prediction of neonatal deaths, using machine learning models (more specifically Random Forest). The top five most common features used to train models are birth weight, gestational age, sex of the child, Apgar score and mother's age. Having predictive models for preventing mortality during and post-pregnancy not only improve the mother's quality of life, as well as it can be a powerful and low-cost tool to decrease mortality ratios.\nBased on the results of this SRL, we can state that scientific efforts have been done in this area, but there are many open research opportunities to be developed by the community.",

    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is independently associated with morbidity and mortality in a wide range of surgical settings. Nowadays, with the increasing use of electronic health records (EHR), advances in patient information retrieval, and cost reduction in clinical informatics, artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to improve early recognition and management for perioperative AKI. However, there is no quantitative synthesis of the performance of these methods. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of artificial intelligence for the prediction of acute kidney injury during the perioperative period.\nPubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched to 2nd October 2021. Studies presenting diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence in the early detection of perioperative acute kidney injury were included. True positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives were pooled to collate specificity and sensitivity with 95% CIs and results were portrayed in forest plots. The risk of bias of eligible studies was assessed using the PROBAST tool.\nNineteen studies involving 304,076 patients were included. Quantitative random-effects meta-analysis using the Rutter and Gatsonis hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (HSROC) model revealed pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.73 to 0.81),0.75 (95% CI: 0.71 to 0.80), and 10.7 (95% CI 8.5 to 13.5), respectively. Threshold effect was found to be the only source of heterogeneity, and there was no evidence of publication bias.\nOur review demonstrates the promising performance of artificial intelligence for early prediction of perioperative AKI. The limitations of lacking external validation performance and being conducted only at a single center should be overcome.\nThis study was not registered with PROSPERO.",

    "abstract": "Bleeding risk factors for gastroesophageal varices (GEV) detected by endoscopy in cirrhotic patients determine the prophylactical treatment patients will undergo in the following 2 years. We propose a methodology for measuring the risk factors. We create an artificial intelligence system (ENDOANGEL-GEV) containing six models to segment GEV and to classify the grades (grades 1-3) and red color signs (RC, RC0-RC3) of varices. It also summarizes changes in the above results with region in real time. ENDOANGEL-GEV is trained using 6034 images from 1156 cirrhotic patients across three hospitals (dataset 1) and validated on multicenter datasets with 11009 images from 141 videos (dataset 2) and in a prospective study recruiting 161 cirrhotic patients from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (dataset 3). In dataset 1, ENDOANGEL-GEV achieves intersection over union values of 0.8087 for segmenting esophageal varices and 0.8141 for gastric varices. In dataset 2, the system maintains fairly accuracy across images from three hospitals. In dataset 3, ENDOANGEL-GEV surpasses attended endoscopists in detecting RC of GEV and classifying grades (p\u2009<\u20090.001). When ranking the risk of patients combined with the Child\u2012Pugh score, ENDOANGEL-GEV outperforms endoscopists for esophageal varices (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and shows comparable performance for gastric varices (p\u2009=\u20090.152). Compared with endoscopists, ENDOANGEL-GEV may help 12.31% (16/130) more patients receive the right intervention. We establish an interpretable system for the endoscopic diagnosis and risk stratification of GEV. It will assist in detecting the first bleeding risk factors accurately and expanding the scope of quantitative measurement of diseases.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have already started impacting clinical practice across various settings worldwide, including the radiography profession. This study is aimed at exploring a world-wide view on AI technologies in relation to knowledge, perceptions, and expectations of radiography professionals.\nAn online survey (hosted on Qualtrics) on key AI concepts was open to radiography professionals worldwide (August 1st to December 31st 2020). The survey sought both quantitative and qualitative data on topical issues relating to knowledge, perceptions, and expectations in relation to AI implementation in radiography practice. Data obtained was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (v.26) and the six-phase thematic analysis approach.\nA total of 314 valid responses were obtained with a fair geographical distribution. Of the respondents, 54.1% (157/290) were from North America and were predominantly clinical practicing radiographers (60.5%, 190/314). Our findings broadly relate to different perceived benefits and misgivings/shortcomings of AI implementation in radiography practice. The benefits relate to enhanced workflows and optimised workstreams while the misgivings/shortcomings revolve around de-skilling and impact on patient-centred care due to over-reliance on advanced technology following AI implementation.\nArtificial intelligence is a tool but to operate optimally it requires human input and validation. Radiographers working at the interface between technology and the patient are key stakeholders in AI implementation. Lack of training and of transparency of AI tools create a mixed response of radiographers when they discuss their perceived benefits and challenges. It is also possible that their responses are nuanced by different regional and geographical contexts when it comes to AI deployment. Irrespective of geography, there is still a lot to be done about formalised AI training for radiographers worldwide. This is a vital step to ensure safe and effective AI implementation, adoption, and faster integration into clinical practice by healthcare workers including radiographers.\nAdvancement of AI technologies and implementation should be accompanied by proportional training of end-users in radiography and beyond. There are many benefits of AI-enabled radiography workflows and improvement on efficiencies but equally there will be widespread disruption of traditional roles and patient-centred care, which can be managed by a well-educated and well-informed workforce.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the largest single contributors to the burden of disease worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer has been shown to be associated with better overall clinical outcomes. Ultrasonography is a vital imaging modality in managing breast lesions. In addition, the development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems has further enhanced the importance of this imaging modality. Proper development of robust and reproducible CAD systems depends on the inclusion of different data from different populations and centers to considerate all variations in breast cancer pathology and minimize confounding factors. The current database contains ultrasound images and radiologist-defined masks of two sets of histologically proven benign and malignant lesions. Using this and similar pieces of data can aid in the development of robust CAD systems.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining more interest in the field of medicine due to its capacity to learn patterns directly from data. This becomes interesting for the field of cardiotocography (CTG) interpretation, since it promises to remove existing biases and improve the well-known issues of inter- and intra-observer variability.\nThe objective of this study was to map current knowledge in AI-assisted interpretation of CTG tracings and thus, to present different approaches with their strengths, gaps, and limitations. The search was performed on Ovid Medline and PubMed databases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-Analysis for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines were followed.\nWe summarized 40 different studies investigating at least one algorithm or system to classify CTG tracings. In addition, the Oxford Sonicaid system is presented because of its wide use in clinical practice.\nThere are several promising approaches in this area, but none of them has gained big acceptance in clinical practice. Further investigation and refinement of the algorithms and features are needed to achieve a validated decision-support system. For this purpose, larger quantities of curated and labeled data may be necessary.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM) is the gold standard procedure used for the diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders (EMD). Artificial intelligence (AI) might provide an efficient solution for the automatic diagnosis of EMD by improving the subjective interpretation of HREM images. The aim of our study was to develop an AI-based system, using neural networks, for the automatic diagnosis of HREM images, based on one wet swallow raw image.\nIn the first phase of the study, the manometry recordings of our patients were retrospectively analyzed by three experienced gastroenterologists, to verify and confirm the correct diagnosis. In the second phase of the study raw images were used to train an artificial neural network. We selected only those tracings with ten test swallows that were available for analysis, including a total of 1570 images. We had 10 diagnosis categories, as follows: normal, type I achalasia, type II achalasia, type III achalasia, esophago-gastric junction outflow obstruction, jackhammer oesophagus, absent contractility, distal esophageal spasm, ineffective esophageal motility, and fragmented peristalsis, based on Chicago classification v3.0 for EMDs.\nThe raw images were cropped, binarized, and automatically divided in 3 parts: training, testing, validation. We used Inception V3 CNN model, pre-trained on ImageNet. We developed a custom classification layer, that allowed the CNN to classify each wet swallow image from the HREM system into one of the diagnosis categories mentioned above. Our algorithm was highly accurate, with an overall precision of more than 93%.\nOur neural network approach using HREM images resulted in a high accuracy automatic diagnosis of EMDs.",

    "abstract": "Rational use of internal resources of hospitals including bed fund turnover is important objective in high-tech medicine. Machine learning technologies can improve neurosurgical care and contribute to patient-oriented approach.\nTo evaluate the quality of AI-guided predicting the length of hospital-stay in a neurosurgical hospital based on the text data of electronic medical records in comparison with expectations of patients and physicians.\nAI-guided prediction was based on analysis of unstructured text records of the electronic medical history (preoperative examination and surgical protocol). Predictive models were learned on the data of the Burdenko Neurosurgery Center accumulated for the period 2000-2017 (90.688 cases). Model testing was performed on 111 completed neurosurgical cases in a prospective study. We compared the accuracy of prediction models compared to expectations of patients and physicians regarding hospital-stay.\nThe median absolute error of machine prediction in the final test was 2.00 days. This value was comparable with the doctor's prediction error.\nThis study demonstrated the possibility of using unstructured textual data to predict the length of hospital-stay in a neurosurgical hospital.\n\u0420\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f

    "abstract": "In assessing food microbial safety, the presence of Escherichia coli is a critical indicator of fecal contamination. However, conventional detection methods require the isolation of bacterial macrocolonies for biochemical or genetic characterization, which takes a few days and is labor-intensive. In this study, we show that the real-time object detection and classification algorithm You Only Look Once version 4 (YOLOv4) can accurately identify the presence of E. coli at the microcolony stage after a 3-h cultivation. Integrating with phase-contrast microscopic imaging, YOLOv4 discriminated E. coli from seven other common foodborne bacterial species with an average precision of 94%. This approach also enabled the rapid quantification of E. coli concentrations over 3 orders of magnitude with an ",

    "abstract": "We, in a large survey of school students from Beijing, aimed to identify the minimal number of promising factors associated with central obesity and the optimal machine-learning algorithm.\nUsing a cluster sampling strategy, this cross-sectional survey was conducted in Beijing in early 2022 among students 6-14 years of age. Information was gleaned \nData from 11,308 children were abstracted for analysis, and 3,970 of children had central obesity. Light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) outperformed the other 10 models. The accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic of LGBM were 0.769982, 0.688312, 0.612323, 0.648098, and 0.825352, respectively. After a comprehensive evaluation, the minimal set involving top 6 important variables that can predict central obesity with descent performance was ascertained, including father's body mass index (BMI), mother's BMI, picky for foods, outdoor activity, screen, and sex. Validation using the deep-learning model indicated that prediction performance between variables in the minimal set and in the whole set was comparable.\nWe have identified and validated a minimal set of six important factors that can decently predict the risk of central obesity when using the optimal LGBM model relative to the whole set.",

    "abstract": "Basic psychological needs satisfaction (BPNS) and Emotional intelligence (EI) have been underscored as helpful psychological constructs in explaining academic engagement. However, the joint interaction of BPNS with EI abilities to explain academic engagement has not been tested. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the interactive role of BPNS with EI abilities in the prediction of academic engagement in a sample of Chinese university students.\nA questionnaire survey was administered to a sample of 466 university students. The data were analyzed using the SPSS (version 21.0) software. The first analysis consisted of descriptive statistics (including mean and standard deviation) and Pearson's correlations among BPNS, EI, and academic engagement. Through structural equation modeling (SEM), direct and indirect effects were calculated.\nThe results showed that BPNS was positively associated with academic engagement and that only the Use of emotion dimension of EI mediated these associations.\nThese results suggest that important interventions incorporated with BPNS and EI abilities, especially the use of emotion ability, may be performed to promote university students' academic engagement.",

In this essay, I examine this view critically and consider the possibility that AI will play a significant role in a quintessential creative activity, the appreciation and production of visual art. This possibility is likely even though attributes typically important to viewers-the agency of the artist, the uniqueness of the art and its purpose might not be relevant to AI art. Additionally, despite the fact that art at its most powerful communicates abstract ideas and nuanced emotions, I argue that AI need not understand ideas or experience emotions to produce meaningful and evocative art. AI is and will increasingly be a powerful tool for artists. The continuing development of aesthetically sensitive machines will challenge our notions of beauty, creativity, and the nature of art.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram has become a substitute tool for echocardiography in left ventricular ejection fraction estimation. However, the direct use of artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram may be not trustable due to the uncertainty of the prediction.\nThe study aimed to establish an artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram with a degree of confidence to identify left ventricular dysfunction.\nThe study collected 76,081 and 11,771 electrocardiograms from an academic medical center and a community hospital to establish and validate the deep learning model, respectively. The proposed deep learning model provided the point estimation of the actual ejection fraction and its standard deviation derived from the maximum probability density function of a normal distribution. The primary analysis focused on the accuracy of identifying patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction \u2264 40%). Since the standard deviation was an uncertainty indicator in a normal distribution, we used it as a degree of confidence in the artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram. We further explored the clinical application of estimated standard deviation and followed up on the new-onset left ventricular dysfunction in patients with initially normal ejection fraction.\nThe area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of detecting left ventricular dysfunction were 0.9549 and 0.9365 in internal and external validation sets. After excluding the cases with a lower degree of confidence, the artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram performed better in the remaining cases in internal (AUC\u2009=\u20090.9759) and external (AUC\u2009=\u20090.9653) validation sets. For the application of future left ventricular dysfunction risk stratification in patients with initially normal ejection fraction, a 4.57-fold risk of future left ventricular dysfunction when the artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram is positive in the internal validation set. The hazard ratio was increased to 8.67 after excluding the cases with a lower degree of confidence. This trend was also validated in the external validation set.\nThe deep learning model with a degree of confidence can provide advanced improvements in identifying left ventricular dysfunction and serve as a decision support and management-guided screening tool for prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Healthcaare delivery will change through the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI). Physicians are likely to be among the professions most affected, though to what extent is not yet clear.\nWe analyzed physicians' and AI experts' stances towards AI-induced changes. This concerned (1) physicians' tasks, (2) job replacement risk, and (3) implications for the ways of working, including human-AI interaction, changes in job profiles, and hierarchical and cross-professional collaboration patterns.\nWe adopted an exploratory, qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews with 24 experts in the fields of AI and medicine, medical informatics, digital medicine, and medical education and training. Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was performed.\nSpecialized tasks currently performed by physicians in all areas of medicine would likely be taken over by AI, including bureaucratic tasks, clinical decision support, and research. However, the concern that physicians will be replaced by an AI system is unfounded, according to experts; AI systems today would be designed only for a specific use case and could not replace the human factor in the patient-physician relationship. Nevertheless, the job profile and professional role of physicians would be transformed as a result of new forms of human-AI collaboration and shifts to higher-value activities. AI could spur novel, more interprofessional teams in medical practice and research and, eventually, democratization and de-hierarchization.\nThe study highlights changes in job profiles of physicians and outlines demands for new categories of medical professionals considering AI-induced changes of work. Physicians should redefine their self-image and assume more responsibility in the age of AI-supported medicine. There is a need for the development of scenarios and concepts for future job profiles in the health professions as well as their education and training.",

    "abstract": "The use of robot swarms for odor source localization (OSL) can better adapt to the reality of unstable turbulence and find chemical contamination or hazard sources faster. Inspired by the collective behavior in nature, swarm intelligence (SI) is recognized as an appropriate algorithm framework for multi-robot system due to its parallelism, scalability and robustness. Applications of SI-based multi-robots for OSL problems have attracted great interest over the last two decades. In this review, we firstly summarize the trending issues in general robot OSL field through comparing some basic counterpart concepts, and then provide a detailed survey of various representative SI algorithms in multi-robot system for odor source localization. The research field originates from the first introduction of the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) and flourishes in applying ever-increasing quantity of its variants as modified PSOs and hybrid PSOs. Moreover, other nature-inspired SI algorithms have also demonstrated the diversity and exploration of this field. The computer simulations and real-world applications reported in the literatures show that those algorithms could well solve the main problems of odor source localization but still retain the potential for further development. Lastly, we provide an outlook on possible future research directions.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the performance of a deep learning (DL) algorithm for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening in Nepal and Mongolia.\nRetrospective analysis of prospectively collected clinical data.\nClinical information and fundus images were obtained from infants in 2 ROP screening programs in Nepal and Mongolia.\nFundus images were obtained using the Forus 3nethra neo (Forus Health) in Nepal and the RetCam Portable (Natus Medical, Inc.) in Mongolia. The overall severity of ROP was determined from the medical record using the International Classification of ROP (ICROP). The presence of plus disease was determined independently in each image using a reference standard diagnosis. The Imaging and Informatics for ROP (i-ROP) DL algorithm was trained on images from the RetCam to classify plus disease and to assign a vascular severity score (VSS) from 1 through\u00a09.\nArea under the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve for the presence of plus disease or type 1 ROP and association between VSS and ICROP disease category.\nThe prevalence of type 1 ROP was found to be higher in Mongolia (14.0%) than in Nepal (2.2%; \nThese data provide preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of the i-ROP DL algorithm for ROP screening in neonatal populations in Nepal and Mongolia using multiple camera systems and are useful for consideration in future clinical implementation of artificial intelligence-based ROP screening in low- and middle-income countries.",

    "abstract": "This trial was designed to determine if artificial intelligence (AI)-supported diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening improved referral uptake in Rwanda.\nThe Rwanda Artificial Intelligence for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening (RAIDERS) study was an investigator-masked, parallel-group randomized controlled trial.\nPatients \u2265 18 years of age with known diabetes who required referral for DR based on AI interpretation.\nThe RAIDERS study screened for DR using retinal imaging with AI interpretation implemented at 4 facilities from March 2021 through July 2021. Eligible participants were assigned randomly (1:1) to immediate feedback of AI grading (intervention) or communication of referral advice after human grading was completed 3 to 5 days after the initial screening (control).\nDifference between study groups in the rate of presentation for referral services within 30 days of being informed of the need for a referral visit.\nOf the 823 clinic patients who met inclusion criteria, 275 participants (33.4%) showed positive findings for referable DR based on AI screening and were randomized for inclusion in the trial. Study participants (mean age, 50.7 years; 58.2% women) were randomized to the intervention (n\u00a0= 136 [49.5%]) or control (n\u00a0= 139 [50.5%]) groups. No significant intergroup differences were found at baseline, and main outcome data were available for analyses for 100% of participants. Referral adherence was statistically significantly higher in the intervention group (70/136 [51.5%]) versus the control group (55/139 [39.6%]; \nImmediate feedback on referral status based on AI-supported screening was associated with statistically significantly higher referral adherence compared with delayed communications of results from human graders. These results provide evidence for an important benefit of AI screening in promoting adherence to prescribed treatment for diabetic eye care in sub-Saharan Africa.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has grown tremendously in the past decade. The application of AI in teledentistry can reform the way dental care, dental education, research, and subsequent innovations can happen remotely. Machine learning including deep learning-based algorithms can be developed to create predictive models of risk assessment for oral health related conditions, consequent complications, and patient stratification. Patients can be empowered to self-diagnose and apply preventive measures or self-manage some early stages of dental diseases. Applications of AI in teledentistry can be beneficial for both, the dental surgeon and the patient. AI enables better remote screening, diagnosis, record keeping, triaging, and monitoring of dental patients based on smart devices. This will take away rudimentary cases requiring run-of-the-mill treatments from dentists and enable them to concentrate on highly complex cases. This would also enable the dentists to serve a larger and deprived population in inaccessible areas. Its usage in teledentistry can bring a paradigm shift from curative to preventive personalised approach in dentistry. A strong asset to teledentistry could be a robust and comprehensive feedback mechanism routed through various channels proposed in this paper. This paper discusses the application of AI in teledentistry and proposes a feedback mechanism to enhance performance in teledentistry.",

    "abstract": "When facing unprecedented emergencies such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a predictive artificial intelligence (AI) model with real-time customized designs can be helpful for clinical decision-making support in constantly changing environments. We created models and compared the performance of AI in collaboration with a clinician and that of AI alone to predict the need for supplemental oxygen based on local, non-image data of patients with COVID-19.\nWe enrolled 30 patients with COVID-19 who were aged >60 years on admission and not treated with oxygen therapy between December 1, 2020 and January 4, 2021 in this 50-bed, single-center retrospective cohort study. The outcome was requirement for oxygen after admission.\nThe model performance to predict the need for oxygen by AI in collaboration with a clinician was better than that by AI alone. Sodium chloride difference >33.5 emerged as a novel indicator to predict the need for oxygen in patients with COVID-19. To prevent severe COVID-19 in older patients, dehydration compensation may be considered in pre-hospitalization care.\nIn clinical practice, our approach enables the building of a better predictive model with prompt clinician feedback even in new scenarios. These can be applied not only to current and future pandemic situations but also to other diseases within the healthcare system.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate the potential of Artificial Intelligence to support diagnosis, mortality assessment, and clinical decisions in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). However, explicit evidence of strategies to overcome the particular challenges for transformed health systems in these countries does not exist.\nThe present study undertakes a review of research on the current status of artificial intelligence (AI) to identify requirements, gaps, challenges, and possible strategies to strengthen the large, complex, and heterogeneous health systems in LMICs.\nAfter introducing the general challenges developing countries face, the methodology of systematic reviews and the meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) is introduced according to the preferred reporting items. Scopus and Web of Science databases were used to identify papers published between 2011-2022, from which we selected 151 eligible publications. Moreover, a narrative review was conducted to analyze the evidence in the literature about explicit evidence of strategies to overcome particular AI challenges in LMICs.\nThe analysis of results was divided into two groups: primary studies, which include experimental studies or case studies using or deploying a specific AI solution (\nResearch on applying AI and ML to healthcare interventions in LMICs is growing; however, apart from very well-described ML methods and algorithms, there are several challenges to be addressed to scale and mainstream experimental and pilot studies. The main challenges include improving the quality of existing data sources, training and modeling AI solutions based on contextual data; and implementing privacy, security, informed consent, ethical, liability, confidentiality, trust, equity, and accountability policies.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology has led to Food and Drug Administration clearance of more than 20 AI algorithms for breast imaging. The steps involved in the clinical implementation of an AI product include identifying all stakeholders, selecting the appropriate product to purchase, evaluating it with a local data set, integrating it into the workflow, and monitoring its performance over time. Despite the potential benefits of improved quality and increased efficiency with AI, several barriers, such as high costs and liability concerns, may limit its widespread implementation. This article lists currently available AI products for breast imaging, describes the key elements of clinical implementation, and discusses barriers to clinical implementation.",

    "abstract": "To analyze the AI research in the field of nursing, to explore the current situation, hot topics, and prospects of AI research in the field of nursing, and to provide a reference for researchers to carry out related studies.\nWe used the VOSviewer 1.6.17, SciMAT, and CiteSpace 5.8.R3 to generate visual cooperation network maps for the country, organizations, authors, citations, and keywords and perform burst detection, theme evolution, and so forth.\nA total of 9318 articles were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Four hundred and thirty-one AI research related to the field of nursing was published by 855 institutions from 54 countries. CIN-Computers Informatics Nursing was the top productive journal. The United States was the dominant country. The transnational cooperation between authors from developed countries was closer than that between authors from developing countries. The main hot topics included nurse rostering, nursing diagnosis, nursing decision support, disease risk factor prediction, nursing big data management, expert system, support vector machine, decision tree, deep learning, natural language processing, and nursing education. Machine learning represented one of the cutting-edge and most applicable branches of artificial intelligence in the field of nursing, and deep learning was the hottest technology among many machine learning methods in recent years. One of the most cited papers was published by Burke in 2004 and cited 500 times, which critically evaluated AI methods to deal with nurse scheduling problems.\nAlthough AI has been paid more and more attention to the field of nursing, there is still a lack of high-yielding authors who have been engaged in this field for a long time. Most of the high contribution authors and institutions came from developed countries; therefore, more transnational and multi-disciplinary cooperation is needed to promote the development of AI in the nursing field. This bibliometric analysis not only provided a comprehensive overview to help researchers to understand the important articles, journals, potential collaborators, and institutions in this field but also analyzed the history, hot spots, and future trends of the research topic to provide inspiration for researchers to choose research directions.",

    "abstract": "Identification, sorting, and sequencing of individual cells directly from in situ samples have great potential for in-depth analysis of the structure and function of microbiomes. In this work, based on an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted object detection model for cell phenotype screening and a cross-interface contact method for single-cell exporting, we developed an automatic and index-based system called EasySort AUTO, where individual microbial cells are sorted and then packaged in a microdroplet and automatically exported in a precisely indexed, \"One-Cell-One-Tube\" manner. The target cell is automatically identified based on an AI-assisted object detection model and then mobilized via an optical tweezer for sorting. Then, a cross-interface contact microfluidic printing method that we developed enables the automated transfer of cells from the chip to the tube, which leads to coupling with subsequent single-cell culture or sequencing. The efficiency of the system for single-cell printing is >93%. The throughput of the system for single-cell printing is ~120\u2009cells/h. Moreover, >80% of single cells of both yeast and ",

    "abstract": "Microbial-based strategy in nanotechnology offers economic, eco-friendly, and biosafety advantages over traditional chemical and physical protocols. The current study describes a novel biosynthesis protocol for chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs), employing a pioneer Streptomyces sp. strain NEAE-83, which exhibited a significant potential for CNPs biosynthesis. It was identified as Streptomyces microflavus strain NEAE-83 based on morphological, and physiological properties as well as the 16S rRNA sequence (GenBank accession number: MG384964). CNPs were characterized by SEM, TEM, EDXS, zeta potential, FTIR, XRD, TGA, and DSC. CNPs biosynthesis was maximized using a\u00a0mathematical\u00a0model, face-centered central composite design (CCFCD). The highest yield of CNPs (9.41 mg/mL) was obtained in run no. 27, using an\u00a0initial pH\u00a0of 5.5,\u00a01% chitosan, 40\u00a0\u00b0C, and a\u00a012\u00a0h incubation period. Innovatively, the artificial neural network (ANN), was used\u00a0for validating and predicting CNPs biosynthesis based on the trials data of CCFCD. Despite the high precision degree of both models, ANN was supreme in the prediction of CNPs biosynthesis compared to CCFCD. ANN had a higher prediction efficacy and, lower error values (RMSE, MDA, and SSE). CNPs biosynthesized by Streptomyces microflavus strain NEAE-83 showed in-vitro antibacterial activity against Pectobacterium carotovorum, which causes the potato soft rot. These results suggested its potential application for controlling the destructive potato soft rot diseases. This is the first report on the biosynthesis of CNPs using a\u00a0newly isolated; Streptomyces microflavus strain NEAE-83 as an eco-friendly approach and optimization of the biosynthesis process by artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are currently used in several areas. The applications of AI and ML based models are also reported for monitoring and design of biological wastewater treatment systems (WWTS). The available information is reviewed and presented in terms of bibliometric analysis, model's description, specific applications, and major findings for investigated WWTS. Among the applied models, artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL) algorithms, random forest (RF), and long short-term memory (LSTM) were predominantly used in the biological wastewater treatment. These models are tested by predictive control of effluent parameters such as biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), nutrient parameters, solids, and metallic substances. Following model performance indicators were mainly used for the accuracy analysis in most of the studies: root mean squared error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), and determination coefficient (DC). Besides, outcomes of various models are also summarized in this study.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced explosive growth in oncology and related specialties in recent years. The improved expertise in data capture, the increased capacity for data aggregation and analytic power, along with decreasing costs of genome sequencing and related biologic \"omics\", set the foundation and need for novel tools that can meaningfully process these data from multiple sources and of varying types. These advances provide value across biomedical discovery, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and prevention, in a multimodal fashion. However, while big data and AI tools have already revolutionized many fields, medicine has partially lagged due to its complexity and multi-dimensionality, leading to technical challenges in developing and validating solutions that generalize to diverse populations. Indeed, inner biases and miseducation of algorithms, in view of their implementation in daily clinical practice, are increasingly relevant concerns; critically, it is possible for AI to mirror the unconscious biases of the humans who generated these algorithms. Therefore, to avoid worsening existing health disparities, it is critical to employ a thoughtful, transparent, and inclusive approach that involves addressing bias in algorithm design and implementation along the cancer care continuum. In this review, a broad landscape of major applications of AI in cancer care is provided, with a focus on cancer research and precision medicine. Major challenges posed by the implementation of AI in the clinical setting will be discussed. Potentially feasible solutions for mitigating bias are provided, in the light of promoting cancer health equity.",

    "abstract": "To explore the impact of artificial-intelligence perceptual learning when performing the ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic block.\nThis simulation-based randomized study enrolled residents who underwent ultrasound-guided sciatic nerve block training at the Department of Anesthesiology of Beijing Jishuitan Hospital between January 2022 and February 2022. Residents were randomly divided into a traditional teaching group and an AI teaching group. All residents attended the same nerve block theory courses, while those in the AI teaching group participated in training course using an AI-assisted nerve identification system based on a convolutional neural network instead of traditional training.\nA total of 40 residents were included. The complication rates of paresthesia during puncture in the first month of clinical sciatic nerve block practice after training were significantly lower in the AI teaching group than in the traditional teaching group [11 (4.12%) vs. 36 (14.06%), P\u2009=\u20090.000093].

With increased availability and decreased price of storage and computing power, the potential for improvement in care is enormous. Many data-driven explorations have started. However, the actual implementation of artificial intelligence in healthcare remains scarce. We describe essential elements during a computer-to-bedside process in a data science project that support the crucial role of the neonatologist. IMPACT: There is a great potential for data science in neonatal medicine. Multidisciplinary teams form the foundation of a data science project. Domain experts will need to play a pivotal role.

    "abstract": "Reproducibility of artificial intelligence (AI) research has become a growing concern. One of the fundamental reasons is the lack of transparency in data, code, and model. In this work, we aimed to systematically review the radiology and nuclear medicine papers on AI in terms of transparency and open science.\nA systematic literature search was performed in PubMed to identify original research studies on AI. The search was restricted to studies published in Q1 and Q2 journals that are also indexed on the Web of Science. A random sampling of the literature was performed. Besides six baseline study characteristics, a total of five availability items were evaluated. Two groups of independent readers including eight readers participated in the study. Inter-rater agreement was analyzed. Disagreements were resolved with consensus.\nFollowing eligibility criteria, we included a final set of 194 papers. The raw data was available in about one-fifth of the papers (34/194; 18%). However, the authors made their private data available only in one paper (1/161; 1%). About one-tenth of the papers made their pre-modeling (25/194; 13%), modeling (28/194; 14%), or post-modeling files (15/194; 8%) available. Most of the papers (189/194; 97%) did not attempt to create a ready-to-use system for real-world usage. Data origin, use of deep learning, and external validation had statistically significantly different distributions. The use of private data alone was negatively associated with the availability of at least one item (p<0.001).\nOverall rates of availability for items were poor, leaving room for substantial improvement.",

    "abstract": "Massively parallel sequencing can provide genetic data for hundreds to thousands of loci in a single assay for various types of forensic testing. However, available commercial kits require an initial PCR amplification of short-to-medium sized targets which limits their application for highly degraded DNA. Development and optimisation of large PCR multiplexes also prevents creation of custom panels that target different suites of markers for identity, biogeographic ancestry, phenotype, and lineage markers (Y-chromosome and mtDNA). Hybridisation enrichment, an alternative approach for target enrichment prior to sequencing, uses biotinylated probes to bind to target DNA and has proven successful on degraded and ancient DNA. We developed a customisable hybridisation capture method, that uses individually mixed baits to allow tailored and targeted enrichment to specific forensic questions of interest. To allow collection of forensic intelligence data, we assembled and tested a custom panel of hybridisation baits to infer biogeographic ancestry, hair and eye colour, and paternal lineage (and sex) on modern male and female samples with a range of self-declared ancestries and hair/eye colour combinations. The panel correctly estimated biogeographic ancestry in 9/12 samples (75%) but detected European admixture in three individuals from regions with admixed demographic history. Hair and eye colour were predicted correctly in 83% and 92% of samples respectively, where intermediate eye colour and blond hair were problematic to predict. Analysis of Y-chromosome SNPs correctly assigned sex and paternal haplogroups, the latter complementing and supporting biogeographic ancestry predictions. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of this hybridisation enrichment approach to forensic intelligence testing using a combined suite of biogeographic ancestry, phenotype, and Y-chromosome SNPs for comprehensive biological profiling.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, research and developments in advancing artificial intelligence (AI) in health care and medicine have increased. High expectations surround the use of AI technologies, such as improvements for diagnosis and increases in the quality of care with reductions in health care costs. The successful development and testing of new AI algorithms require large amounts of high-quality data. Academic hospitals could provide the data needed for AI development, but granting legal, controlled, and regulated access to these data for developers and researchers is difficult. Therefore, the German Federal Ministry of Health supports the Protected Artificial Intelligence Innovation Environment for Patient-Oriented Digital Health Solutions for Developing, Testing, and Evidence-Based Evaluation of Clinical Value (pAItient) project, aiming to install the AI Innovation Environment at the Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany. The AI Innovation Environment was designed as a proof-of-concept extension of the already existing Medical Data Integration Center. It will establish a process to support every step of developing and testing AI-based technologies.\nThe first part of the pAItient project, as presented in this research protocol, aims to explore stakeholders' requirements for developing AI in partnership with an academic hospital and granting AI experts access to anonymized personal health data.\nWe planned a multistep mixed methods approach. In the first step, researchers and employees from stakeholder organizations were invited to participate in semistructured interviews. In the following step, questionnaires were developed based on the participants' answers and distributed among the stakeholders' organizations to quantify qualitative findings and discover important aspects that were not mentioned by the interviewees. The questionnaires will be analyzed descriptively. In addition, patients and physicians were interviewed as well. No survey questionnaires were developed for this second group of participants. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Heidelberg University Hospital (approval number: S-241/2021).\nData collection concluded in summer 2022. Data analysis is planned to start in fall 2022. We plan to publish the results in winter 2022 to 2023.\nThe results of our study will help in shaping the AI Innovation Environment at our academic hospital according to stakeholder requirements. With this approach, in turn, we aim to shape an AI environment that is effective and is deemed acceptable by all parties.\nDERR1-10.2196/42208.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have demonstrated impressive performance across a variety of clinical tasks. However, notoriously, sometimes these systems are \"black boxes.\" The initial response in the literature was a demand for \"explainable AI.\" However, recently, several authors have suggested that making AI more explainable or \"interpretable\" is likely to be at the cost of the accuracy of these systems and that prioritizing interpretability in medical AI may constitute a \"lethal prejudice.\" In this article, we defend the value of interpretability in the context of the use of AI in medicine. Clinicians may prefer interpretable systems over more accurate black boxes, which in turn is sufficient to give designers of AI reason to prefer more interpretable systems in order to ensure that AI is adopted and its benefits realized. Moreover, clinicians may be justified in this preference. Achieving the downstream benefits from AI is critically dependent on how the outputs of these systems are interpreted by physicians and patients. A preference for the use of highly accurate black box AI systems, over less accurate but more interpretable systems, may itself constitute a form of lethal prejudice that may diminish the benefits of AI to-and perhaps even harm-patients.",

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) is important in the diagnosing of lung cancer. The combination of CT features and artificial intelligence algorithm have been used in the diagnosis of various lung diseases. However, limited studies focused on the relationship between the combination of CT features and artificial intelligence algorithm and lymph node metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study developed an algorithm for lung cancer CT image segmentation based on an artificial neural network model and investigated the role of a nomogram model based on CT images for predicting lymph node metastasis in lung cancer.\nWiener filtering and fuzzy enhancement were first used to suppress image noise and improve image contrast. Next, texture features and fractal features were extracted. In the third step, the artificial neural network model was trained and tested according to the best parameters of the network.\nThe area under the curve (AUC) of the constructed nomogram model on the training set and the test set were 0.859 (sensitivity, 0.810; specificity, 0.773) and 0.864 (sensitivity, 0.820; specificity, 0.753), respectively. The decision curve indicated that the model had good clinical application value. The lung cancer CT images contained 13 significant regional features of cancer. The best classification function obtained from training and testing data was Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in the training stage could reach 98.4%, 100%, and 98.6%, respectively, and the corresponding indexes in the test stage reached 90.9%, 100%, and 95.1%, respectively.\nThe image segmentation algorithm based on the artificial neural network model could extract CT lung cancer lesions efficiently and quasi-determinately, which could be used as an effective tool for radiologists to diagnose lung cancer. The nomogram model based on CT image features and related clinical indicators was an effective method for noninvasive prediction of lymph node metastasis in lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "With advances in next-generation sequencing technology, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has been widely implemented to detect fetal aneuploidies, including trisomy 21, 18, and 13 (T21, T18, and T13). Most NIPT methods use cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragment count (FC) in maternal blood. In this study, we developed a novel NIPT method using cfDNA fragment distance (FD) and convolutional neural network-based artificial intelligence algorithm (aiD-NIPT). Four types of aiD-NIPT algorithm (mean, median, interquartile range, and its ensemble) were developed using 2,215 samples. In an analysis of 17,678 clinical samples, all algorithms showed >99.40% accuracy for T21/T18/T13, and the ensemble algorithm showed the best performance (sensitivity: 99.07%, positive predictive value (PPV): 88.43%); the FC-based conventional Z-score and normalized chromosomal value showed 98.15% sensitivity, with 40.77% and 36.81% PPV, respectively. In conclusion, FD-based aiD-NIPT was successfully developed, and it showed better performance than FC-based NIPT methods.",

    "abstract": "Flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) is considered the gold standard in diagnosing oropharyngeal dysphagia. Recent advances in deep learning have led to a resurgence of artificial intelligence-assisted computer-aided diagnosis (AI-assisted CAD) for a variety of applications. AI-assisted CAD would be a remarkable benefit in providing medical services to populations with inadequate access to dysphagia experts, especially in aging societies. This paper presents an AI-assisted CAD named FEES-CAD for aspiration and penetration detection on video recording during FEES. FEES-CAD segments the input FEES video and classifies penetration, aspiration, residue in the vallecula, and residue in the hypopharynx based on the segmented FEES video. We collected and annotated FEES videos from 199 patients to train the network and tested the performance of FEES-CAD using FEES videos from other 40 patients. These patients consecutively underwent FEES between December 2016 and August 2019 at Fukushima Medical University Hospital. FEES videos were deidentified, randomized, and rated by FEES-CAD and laryngologists with over 15 years of experience in performing FEES. FEES-CAD achieved an average Dice similarity coefficient of 98.6[Formula: see text]. FEES-CAD achieved expert-level accuracy performance on penetration (92.5[Formula: see text]), aspiration (92.5[Formula: see text]), residue in the vallecula (100[Formula: see text]), and residue in the hypopharynx (87.5[Formula: see text]) classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, FEES-CAD is the first CNN-based system that achieves expert-level performance in detecting aspiration and penetration.",

    "abstract": "Schooling, socioeconomic status (SES), and genetics all impact intelligence. However, it is unclear to what extent their contributions are unique and if they interact. Here we used a multi-trait polygenic score for cognition (cogPGS) with a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design to isolate how months of schooling relate to intelligence in 6567 children (aged 9-11). We found large, independent effects of schooling (\u03b2 ~\u20090.15), cogPGS (\u03b2 ~\u20090.10), and SES (\u03b2 ~\u20090.20) on working memory, crystallized (cIQ), and fluid intelligence (fIQ). Notably, two years of schooling had a larger effect on intelligence than the lifetime consequences, since birth, of SES or cogPGS-based inequalities. However, schooling showed no interaction with cogPGS or SES for the three intelligence domains tested. While schooling had strong main effects on intelligence, it did not lessen, nor widen the impact of these preexisting SES or genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Unreliable predictions can occur when an artificial intelligence (AI) system is presented with data it has not been exposed to during training. We demonstrate the use of conformal prediction to detect unreliable predictions, using histopathological diagnosis and grading of prostate biopsies as example. We digitized 7788 prostate biopsies from 1192 men in the STHLM3 diagnostic study, used for training, and 3059 biopsies from 676 men used for testing. With conformal prediction, 1 in 794 (0.1%) predictions is incorrect for cancer diagnosis (compared to 14 errors [2%] without conformal prediction) while 175 (22%) of the predictions are flagged as unreliable when the AI-system is presented with new data from the same lab and scanner that it was trained on. Conformal prediction could with small samples (N\u2009=\u200949 for external scanner, N\u2009=\u200910 for external lab and scanner, and N\u2009=\u200912 for external lab, scanner and pathology assessment) detect systematic differences in external data leading to worse predictive performance. The AI-system with conformal prediction commits 3 (2%) errors for cancer detection in cases of atypical prostate tissue compared to 44 (25%) without conformal prediction, while the system flags 143 (80%) unreliable predictions. We conclude that conformal prediction can increase patient safety of AI-systems.",

    "abstract": "Trustworthiness is a core tenet of medicine. The patient-physician relationship is evolving from a dyad to a broader ecosystem of health care. With the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine, the elements of trust must be revisited. We envision a road map for the establishment of trustworthy AI ecosystems in nuclear medicine. In this report, AI is contextualized in the history of technologic revolutions. Opportunities for AI applications in nuclear medicine related to diagnosis, therapy, and workflow efficiency, as well as emerging challenges and critical responsibilities, are discussed. Establishing and maintaining leadership in AI require a concerted effort to promote the rational and safe deployment of this innovative technology by engaging patients, nuclear medicine physicians, scientists, technologists, and referring providers, among other stakeholders, while protecting our patients and society. This strategic plan was prepared by the AI task force of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning have enabled development of the automated Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) prediction algorithms using non-contrast enhanced computed tomography (NCCT) scans. The applicability of automated ASPECTS in daily clinical practice is yet to be established. The objective of this meta-analysis was to directly compare the performance of automated and manual ASPECTS predictions in recognizing early stroke changes on NCCT.\nThe MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were searched. The last database search was performed on March 10, 2022. Studies reporting the diagnostic performance and validity of automated ASPECTS software compared with expert readers were included. The outcomes were the interobserver reliability of outputs between ASPECTS versus expert readings, experts versus reference standard, and ASPECTS versus reference standard by means of pooled Fisher's Z transformation of the interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).\nEleven studies were included in the meta-analysis, involving 1976 patients. The meta-analyses showed good interobserver reliability between experts (ICC 0.72 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.79); p<0.001), moderate reliability in the correlation between automated and expert readings (ICC 0.54 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.67); p<0.001), good reliability between the total expert readings and the reference standard (ICC 0.62 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.71); p<0.001), and good reliability between the automated predictions and the reference standard (ICC 0.72 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.80); p<0.001).\nArtificial intelligence-driven ASPECTS software has comparable or better performance than physicians in terms of recognizing early stroke changes on NCCT.",

    "abstract": "Protocolling, the process of determining the most appropriate acquisition parameters for an imaging study, is time-consuming and produces variable results depending on the performing physician. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of an artificial intelligence-based semiautomated tool in reducing the workload and decreasing unwarranted variation in the protocolling process.\nWe collected 19,721 MR imaging brain examinations at a large academic medical center. Criterion standard labels were created using physician consensus. A model based on the Long Short-Term Memory network was trained to predict the most appropriate protocol for any imaging request. The model was modified into a clinical decision support tool in which high-confidence predictions, determined by the values the model assigns to each possible choice, produced the best protocol automatically and low confidence predictions provided a shortened list of protocol choices for review.\nThe model achieved 90.5% accuracy in predicting the criterion standard labels and demonstrated higher agreement than the original protocol assignments, which achieved 85.9% accuracy (\u03ba = 0.84 versus 0.72, \nOur model achieved high accuracy on a standard based on physician consensus. It showed promise as a clinical decision support tool to reduce the workload by automating the protocolling of a sizeable portion of examinations while maintaining high accuracy for the remaining examinations.",

    "abstract": "Digital health solutions that operate with or without artificial intelligence (D/AI) raise several responsibility challenges. Though many frameworks and tools have been developed, determining what principles should be translated into practice remains under debate. This scoping review aims to provide policymakers with a rigorous body of knowledge by asking: 1) what kinds of practice-oriented tools are available?; 2) on what principles do they predominantly rely?; and 3) what are their limitations?\nWe searched six academic and three grey literature databases for practice-oriented tools, defined as frameworks and/or sets of principles with clear operational explanations, published in English or French from 2015 to 2021. Characteristics of the tools were qualitatively coded and variations across the dataset identified through descriptive statistics and a network analysis.\nA total of 56 tools met our inclusion criteria: 19 health-specific tools (33.9%) and 37 generic tools (66.1%). They adopt a normative (57.1%), reflective (35.7%), operational (3.6%), or mixed approach (3.6%) to guide developers (14.3%), managers (16.1%), end users (10.7%), policymakers (5.4%) or multiple groups (53.6%). The frequency of 40 principles varies greatly across tools (from 0% for 'environmental sustainability' to 83.8% for 'transparency'). While 50% or more of the generic tools promote up to 19 principles, 50% or more of the health-specific tools promote 10 principles, and 50% or more of all tools disregard 21 principles. In contrast to the scattered network of principles proposed by academia, the business sector emphasizes closely connected principles. Few tools rely on a formal methodology (17.9%).\nDespite a lack of consensus, there is a solid knowledge-basis for policymakers to anchor their role in such a dynamic field. Because several tools lack rigour and ignore key social, economic, and environmental issues, an integrated and methodologically sound approach to responsibility in D/AI solutions is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal and gastric cancer are major causes of cancer-related deaths. In Korea, gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic biopsy specimens account for a high percentage of histopathologic examinations. Lack of a sufficient pathologist workforce can cause an increase in human errors, threatening patient safety. Therefore, we developed a digital pathology total solution combining artificial intelligence (AI) classifier models and pathology laboratory information system for GI endoscopic biopsy specimens to establish a post-analytic daily fast quality control (QC) system, which was applied in clinical practice for a 3-month trial run by four pathologists.\nOur whole slide image (WSI) classification framework comprised patch-generator, patch-level classifier, and WSI-level classifier. The classifiers were both based on DenseNet (Dense Convolutional Network). In laboratory tests, the WSI classifier achieved accuracy rates of 95.8% and 96.0% in classifying histopathological WSIs of colorectal and gastric endoscopic biopsy specimens, respectively, into three classes (Negative for dysplasia, Dysplasia, and Malignant). Classification by pathologic diagnosis and AI prediction were compared and daily reviews were conducted, focusing on discordant cases for early detection of potential human errors by the pathologists, allowing immediate correction, before the pathology report error is conveyed to the patients. During the 3-month AI-assisted daily QC trial run period, approximately 7-10 times the number of slides compared to that in the conventional monthly QC (33 months) were reviewed by pathologists; nearly 100% of GI endoscopy biopsy slides were double-checked by the AI models. Further, approximately 17-30 times the number of potential human errors were detected within an average of 1.2 days.\nThe AI-assisted daily QC system that we developed and established demonstrated notable improvements in QC, in quantitative, qualitative, and time utility aspects. Ultimately, we developed an independent AI-assisted post-analytic daily fast QC system that was clinically applicable and influential, which could enhance patient safety.",

    "abstract": "The consolidation of Telepharmacy during the COVID-19\u00a0pandemic\u00a0 has raised the need for managing large volumes of real-time\u00a0activity data\u00a0 through data analysis. The aim of this project was to design\u00a0a dynamic, user- friendly, customizable scorecard in a hospital pharmacy\u00a0service for the\u00a0 visualization and analysis of Telepharmacy activity indicators\u00a0through the use\u00a0 of advanced business intelligence technology.\nThe software tool was developed by a multidisciplinary team\u00a0between\u00a0 April and May 2021, driven from the hospital pharmacy service.\u00a0Once the Telepharmacy indicators of interest were established,\u00a0 datasets\u00a0were extracted from raw databases (administrative databases,\u00a0 Telepharmacy\u00a0database, outpatient dispensing software, drug catalogues)\u00a0 through\u00a0data analysis. The different data sources were integrated in a\u00a0 scorecard\u00a0using PowerBI\u00ae. The criteria for processing missing and duplicated\u00a0 data\u00a0were defined, and data pre-processing, normalization and transformation\u00a0were performed. Once the pilot scorecard was validated by\u00a0 different\u00a0profiles of users, the structure was designed for the panels to\u00a0 automatically\u00a0update as databases were updated.\nDesign and implementation of a scorecard of Telepharmacy\u00a0activity:\u00a0 general descriptive panel (demographic profile of patients, count\u00a0and delivery\u00a0 conditions, program and medical service); geolocation of\u00a0destination;\u00a0 pharmacological profile; relative analysis of patients involved\u00a0in the\u00a0 Telepharmacy program with respect to the total of outpatients. In\u00a0the last\u00a0 updating as of January 2022, data from 16,000 dispensations to\u00a0more than\u00a0 4,000 patients had been collected. This means that 21.93%\u00a0of outpatients had\u00a0 benefited at some time point from the Telepharmacy\u00a0service. Filters enable the\u00a0 visualization of timeline progress and patient\u00a0characterization, and\u00a0 measure Telepharmacy activity by program.\nThe processing of large Telemedicine datasets from\u00a0various\u00a0 sources through Business Intelligence in a hospital pharmacy\u00a0service makes it\u00a0 possible to synthesize information, generate customized\u00a0reports, and visualize\u00a0 information in a dynamic and attractive format. The\u00a0application of this new\u00a0 technology will help us improve strategic clinical\u00a0and management decision\u00a0 making.\nLa consolidaci\u00f3n de la Telefarmacia en el contexto de la pandemia\u00a0por la COVID-19 exige manejar a tiempo real un gran volumen de\u00a0datos de actividad mediante an\u00e1lisis de datos. El objetivo de este trabajo\u00a0fue dise\u00f1ar un cuadro de mando \u00e1gil, personalizable y din\u00e1mico para la\u00a0visualizaci\u00f3n y an\u00e1lisis de indicadores de actividad en Telefarmacia en un\u00a0servicio de farmacia de hospital, mediante el empleo de herramientas\u00a0 avanzadas\u00a0de inteligencia empresarial (business intelligence).M\u00e9todo: Un equipo de trabajo multidisciplinar desarroll\u00f3 una herramienta\u00a0de\u00a0 software entre abril y mayo de 2021 impulsado desde el servicio\u00a0de farmacia\u00a0 de hospital. Una vez consensuados los indicadores\u00a0de inter\u00e9s en Telefarmacia,\u00a0 se extrajeron los datos a partir de bases de\u00a0datos brutas (base de datos de\u00a0 Telefarmacia, programa de dispensaci\u00f3n\u00a0de pacientes externos, bases de datos\u00a0 administrativas, cat\u00e1logos\u00a0de f\u00e1rmacos) mediante an\u00e1lisis de datos. La\u00a0 integraci\u00f3n de las diferentes\u00a0fuentes de datos en el cuadro de mando se realiz\u00f3 mediante PowerBI\u00ae.\u00a0Se defini\u00f3 el manejo de los datos perdidos y duplicados y\u00a0 se aplic\u00f3\u00a0preprocesamiento, normalizaci\u00f3n y transformaci\u00f3n de los datos. Una\u00a0 vez\u00a0 validado el piloto por diferentes tipos de usuarios, se dise\u00f1\u00f3 la estructura para actualizaci\u00f3n autom\u00e1tica de los paneles con las sucesivas actualizaciones de las fuentes de datos.\nDise\u00f1o e implementaci\u00f3n de un cuadro de mando de la\u00a0actividad\u00a0 en Telefarmacia: panel descriptivo general (perfil demogr\u00e1fico\u00a0de pacientes,\u00a0 recuento y condiciones de env\u00edos, programa y servicio\u00a0m\u00e9dico); geolocalizaci\u00f3n\u00a0 de destino; perfil farmacol\u00f3gico; an\u00e1lisis relativo\u00a0de los\u00a0 pacientes beneficiarios de Telefarmacia respecto del total\u00a0de pacientes\u00a0 externos. En el \u00faltimo corte, a enero de 2022, se hab\u00edan\u00a0incluido datos de\u00a0 16.000 dispensaciones con entrega informada a m\u00e1s\u00a0de 4.000 pacientes, lo\u00a0 que supone que el 21,93% de los pacientes externos\u00a0han estado en alg\u00fan momento en el programa de Telefarmacia. La\u00a0aplicaci\u00f3n de filtros permite\u00a0 visualizar la evoluci\u00f3n temporal, caracterizar\u00a0grupos de pacientes y\u00a0 dimensionar la actividad por programas.\nEl procesamiento de paquetes de datos de Telemedicina,\u00a0de\u00a0 gran volumen, dif\u00edcil manejo y procedentes de diversas fuentes relativas a\u00a0Telefarmacia mediante inteligencia empresarial, en un servicio de farmacia\u00a0 de\u00a0hospital, permite sintetizar la informaci\u00f3n y proporcionar informes\u00a0 personalizados\u00a0y visualizaciones din\u00e1micas y atractivas.

    "abstract": "Early detection of pneumothorax, most often via chest radiography, can help determine need for emergent clinical intervention. The ability to accurately detect and rapidly triage pneumothorax with an artificial intelligence (AI) model could assist with earlier identification and improve care.\nTo compare the accuracy of an AI model vs consensus thoracic radiologist interpretations in detecting any pneumothorax (incorporating both nontension and tension pneumothorax) and tension pneumothorax.\nThis diagnostic study was a retrospective standalone performance assessment using a data set of 1000 chest radiographs captured between June 1, 2015, and May 31, 2021. The radiographs were obtained from patients aged at least 18 years at 4 hospitals in the Mass General Brigham hospital network in the United States. Included radiographs were selected using 2 strategies from all chest radiography performed at the hospitals, including inpatient and outpatient. The first strategy identified consecutive radiographs with pneumothorax through a manual review of radiology reports, and the second strategy identified consecutive radiographs with tension pneumothorax using natural language processing. For both strategies, negative radiographs were selected by taking the next negative radiograph acquired from the same radiography machine as each positive radiograph. The final data set was an amalgamation of these processes. Each radiograph was interpreted independently by up to 3 radiologists to establish consensus ground-truth interpretations. Each radiograph was then interpreted by the AI model for the presence of pneumothorax and tension pneumothorax. This study was conducted between July and October 2021, with the primary analysis performed between October and November 2021.\nThe primary end points were the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for the detection of pneumothorax and tension pneumothorax. The secondary end points were the sensitivities and specificities for the detection of pneumothorax and tension pneumothorax.\nThe final analysis included radiographs from 985 patients (mean [SD] age, 60.8 [19.0] years; 436 [44.3%] female patients), including 307 patients with nontension pneumothorax, 128 patients with tension pneumothorax, and 550 patients without pneumothorax. The AI model detected any pneumothorax with an AUC of 0.979 (95% CI, 0.970-0.987), sensitivity of 94.3% (95% CI, 92.0%-96.3%), and specificity of 92.0% (95% CI, 89.6%-94.2%) and tension pneumothorax with an AUC of 0.987 (95% CI, 0.980-0.992), sensitivity of 94.5% (95% CI, 90.6%-97.7%), and specificity of 95.3% (95% CI, 93.9%-96.6%).\nThese findings suggest that the assessed AI model accurately detected pneumothorax and tension pneumothorax in this chest radiograph data set. The model's use in the clinical workflow could lead to earlier identification and improved care for patients with pneumothorax.",

    "abstract": "Herein, a robust and reproducible eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach is presented, which allows prediction of developmental toxicity, a challenging human-health endpoint in toxicology. The application of XAI as an alternative method is of the utmost importance with developmental toxicity being one of the most animal-intensive areas of regulatory toxicology. In this work, the established CAESAR (Computer Assisted Evaluation of industrial chemical Substances According to Regulations) training set made of 234 chemicals for model learning is employed. Two test sets, including as a whole 585 chemicals, were instead used for validation and generalization purposes. The proposed framework favorably compares with the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, thus resulting in a reliable support system for developmental toxicity ensuring informativeness, uncertainty estimation, generalization, and transparency. Based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm, our predictive model provides easy interpretative keys based on specific molecular descriptors and structural alerts enabling one to distinguish toxic and nontoxic chemicals. Inspired by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) principles for the validation of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs) for regulatory purposes, the results are summarized in a standard report in portable document format, enclosing also details concerned with a density-based model applicability domain and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) explainability, the latter particularly useful to better understand the effective roles played by molecular features. Notably, our model has been implemented in TIRESIA (Toxicology Intelligence and Regulatory Evaluations for Scientific and Industry Applications), a free of charge web platform available at http://tiresia.uniba.it.",

    "abstract": "Successful social interactions require a good understanding of the emotional states of other people. This information is often not directly communicated but must be inferred. As all emotional experiences are also imbedded in the visceral or interoceptive state of the body (i.e., accelerating heart rate during arousal), successfully inferring the interoceptive states of others may open a window into their emotional state. But how well can people do that? Here, we replicate recent results showing that people can discriminate between the cardiac states (i.e., the resting heartrate) of other people by simply looking at them. We further tested whether the ability to infer the interoceptive states of others depends on one's own interoceptive abilities. We measured people's performance in a cardioception task and their self-reported interoceptive accuracy. Whilst neither was directly associated to their ability to infer the heartrate of another person, we found a significant interaction. Specifically, overestimating one's own interoceptive capacities was associated with a worse performance at inferring the heartrate of others. In contrast, underestimating one's own interoceptive capacities did not have such influence. This pattern suggests that deficient beliefs about own interoceptive capacities can have detrimental effects on inferring the interoceptive states of other people.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s42761-022-00151-4.",

    "abstract": "Bronchoscopy is a key step in the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory diseases. However, the level of expertise varies among different bronchoscopists. Artificial intelligence (AI) may help them identify bronchial lumens. Thus, a bronchoscopy quality-control system based on AI was built to improve the performance of bronchoscopists.\nThis single-center observational study consecutively collected bronchoscopy videos from Shanghai Chest Hospital and segmented each video into 31 different anatomical locations to develop an AI-assisted system based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. We then designed a single-center trial to compare the accuracy of lumen recognition by bronchoscopists with and without the assistance of the AI system.\nA total of 28,441 qualified images of bronchial lumen were used to train the CNNs. In the cross-validation set, the optimal accuracy of the six models was between 91.83% and 96.62%. In the test set, the visual geometry group 16 (VGG-16) achieved optimal performance with an accuracy of 91.88%, and an area under the curve of 0.995. In the clinical evaluation, the accuracy rate of the AI system alone was 54.30% (202/372). For the identification of bronchi except for segmental bronchi, the accuracy was 82.69% (129/156). In group 1, the recognition accuracy rates of doctors A, B, a and b alone were 42.47%, 34.68%, 28.76%, and 29.57%, respectively, but increased to 57.53%, 54.57%, 54.57%, and 46.24% respectively when combined with the AI system. Similarly, in group 2, the recognition accuracy rates of doctors C, D, c, and d were 37.90%, 41.40%, 30.91%, and 33.60% respectively, but increased to 51.61%, 47.85%, 53.49%, and 54.30% respectively, when combined with the AI system. Except for doctor D, the accuracy of doctors in recognizing lumen was significantly higher with AI assistance than without AI assistance, regardless of their experience (P<0.001).\nOur AI system could better recognize bronchial lumen and reduce differences in the operation levels of different bronchoscopists. It could be used to improve the quality of everyday bronchoscopies.",

    "abstract": "At present, immunotherapy is a very promising treatment method for lung cancer patients, while the factors affecting response are still controversial. It is crucial to predict the efficacy of lung squamous carcinoma patients who received immunotherapy.\nIn our retrospective study, we enrolled lung squamous carcinoma patients who received immunotherapy at Beijing Chest Hospital from January 2017 to November 2021. All patients were grouped into two cohorts randomly, the training cohort (80% of the total) and the test cohort (20% of the total). The training cohort was used to build neural network models to assess the efficacy and outcome of immunotherapy in lung squamous carcinoma based on clinical information. The main outcome was the disease control rate (DCR), and then the secondary outcomes were objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).\nA total of 289 patients were included in this study. The DCR model had area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.9526 (95%CI, 0.9088-0.9879) in internal validation and 0.9491 (95%CI, 0.8704-1.0000) in external validation. The ORR model had AUC of 0.8030 (95%CI, 0.7437-0.8545) in internal validation and 0.7040 (95%CI, 0.5457-0.8379) in external validation. The PFS model had AUC of 0.8531 (95%CI, 0.8024-0.8975) in internal validation and 0.7602 (95%CI, 0.6236-0.8733) in external validation. The OS model had AUC of 0.8006 (95%CI, 0.7995-0.8017) in internal validation and 0.7382 (95%CI, 0.7366-0.7398) in external validation.\nThe neural network models show benefits in the efficacy evaluation of immunotherapy to lung squamous carcinoma patients, especially the DCR and ORR models. In our retrospective study, we found that neoadjuvant and adjuvant immunotherapy may bring greater efficacy benefits to patients.",

    "abstract": "The advent of whole-slide imaging, faster image data generation, and cheaper forms of data storage have made it easier for pathologists to manipulate digital slide images and interpret more detailed biological processes in conjunction with clinical samples. In parallel, with continuous breakthroughs in object detection, image feature extraction, image classification and image segmentation, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming the most beneficial technology for high-throughput analysis of image data in various biomedical imaging disciplines. Integrating digital images into biological workflows, advanced algorithms, and computer vision techniques expands the biologist's horizons beyond the microscope slide. Here, we introduce recent developments in AI applied to microscopy in hematopathology. We give an overview of its concepts and present its applications in normal or abnormal hematopoietic cells identification. We discuss how AI shows great potential to push the limits of microscopy and enhance the resolution, signal and information content of acquired data. Its shortcomings are discussed, as well as future directions for the field.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has created a new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunity for colorectal cancer (CRC). Numerous academic and clinical studies have demonstrated that high-level auxiliary diagnosis and treatment systems based on AI technology can significantly improve the readability of medical data, objectively provide a reliable and comprehensive reference for physicians, reduce the experience gap between physicians, and aid physicians in making more accurate diagnosis decisions. In this study, we used bibliometric techniques to visually analyze the literature about AI in the CRC field and summarize the current situation and research hotspots in this field.\nThe relevant literature on AI in the field of CRC research was obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. The software CiteSpace was utilized to analyze the number of papers, countries, institutions, authors, journals, cited literature, and keywords of the included literature and generate a visual knowledge map. The present study aims to evaluate the origin, current hotspots, and research trends of AI in CRC using bibliometric analysis.\nAs of March 2022, 64 nations/regions, 230 institutions, 245 journals, and 300 authors had published 562 AI-related articles in the field of CRC. Since 2016, each year has seen an exponential increase. China and the United States were the largest contributors, with the largest number of beneficial research institutions and the closest collaboration relationship. The World Journal of Gastroenterology is this field's most widely published journal. Diagnosis and treatment research, gene and immunology research, intestinal polyp research, tumor grading research, gastrointestinal endoscopy research, and prognosis research comprised the six topics derived from high-frequency keyword cluster analysis.\nIn recent years, field research has been a popular topic of discussion. The results of our bibliometric analysis allow us to comprehend better the current situation and trend of this research field, and the quantitative data indicators can serve as a guide for the research and application of global scholars.",

    "abstract": "Ventricular premature complex (VPC) is a common arrhythmia\u00a0in clinical practice. VPC could trigger ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation or VPC-induced cardiomyopathy in susceptible patients. Existing screening methods require prolonged monitoring and are limited by cost and low yield when the frequency of VPC is low. Twelve-lead\u00a0electrocardiogram (ECG) is low cost and widely used. We aimed to identify patients with VPC during normal sinus rhythm (NSR) using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-based ECG reading.\nWe developed AI-enabled ECG algorithm using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the ECG signature of VPC presented during NSR using standard 12-lead ECGs. A total of 2515 ECG records from 398 patients with VPC were collected. Among them, only ECG records of NSR without VPC (1617 ECG records) were parsed.\nA total of 753 normal ECG records from 387 patients under NSR were used for comparison. Both image and time-series datasets were parsed for the training process by the CNN models. The computer architectures were optimized to select the best model for the training process. Both the single-input image model (InceptionV3, accuracy: 0.895, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.683-0.937) and multi-input time-series model (ResNet50V2, accuracy: 0.880, 95% CI 0.646-0.943) yielded satisfactory results for VPC prediction, both of which were better than the single-input time-series model (ResNet50V2, accuracy: 0.840, 95% CI 0.629-0.952).\nAI-enabled ECG acquired during NSR permits rapid identification at point of care of individuals with VPC and has the potential to predict VPC episodes automatically rather than traditional long-time monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Shock management requires quick and reliable means to monitor the hemodynamic effects of fluid resuscitation. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a relatively quick and non-invasive imaging technique capable of capturing cardiac output (CO) variations in acute settings. However, POCUS is plagued by variable operator skill and interpretation. Artificial intelligence may assist healthcare professionals obtain more objective and precise measurements during ultrasound imaging, thus increasing usability among users with varying experience. In this feasibility study, we compared the performance of novice POCUS users in measuring CO with manual techniques to a novel automation-assisted technique that provides real-time feedback to correct image acquisition for optimal aortic outflow velocity measurement.\n28 junior critical care trainees with limited experience in POCUS performed manual and automation-assisted CO measurements on a single healthy volunteer. CO measurements were obtained using left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) velocity time integral (VTI) and LVOT diameter. Measurements obtained by study subjects were compared to those taken by board-certified echocardiographers. Comparative analyses were performed using Spearman's rank correlation and Bland-Altman matched-pairs analysis.\nAdequate image acquisition was 100% feasible. The correlation between manual and automated VTI values was not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.11) and means from both groups underestimated the mean values obtained by board-certified echocardiographers. Automated measurements of VTI in the trainee cohort were found to have more reproducibility, narrower measurement range (6.2 vs. 10.3\u00a0cm), and reduced standard deviation (1.98 vs. 2.33\u00a0cm) compared to manual measurements. The coefficient of variation across raters was 11.5%, 13.6% and 15.4% for board-certified echocardiographers, automated, and manual VTI tracing, respectively.\nOur study demonstrates that novel automation-assisted VTI is feasible and can decrease variability while increasing precision in CO measurement. These results support the use of artificial intelligence-augmented image acquisition in routine critical care ultrasound and may have a role for evaluating the response of CO to hemodynamic interventions. Further investigations into artificial intelligence-assisted ultrasound systems in clinical settings are warranted.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature on the diagnostic performance, in independent test cohorts, of artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms aimed at characterizing/detecting prostate cancer on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nMedline, Embase and Web of Science were searched for studies published between January 2018 and September 2022, using a histological reference standard, and assessing prostate cancer characterization/detection by AI-based MRI algorithms in test cohorts composed of more than 40 patients and with at least one of the following independency criteria as compared to the training cohort: different institution, different population type, different MRI vendor, different magnetic field strength or strict temporal splitting.\nThirty-five studies were selected. The overall risk of bias was low. However, 23 studies did not use predefined diagnostic thresholds, which may have optimistically biased the results. Test cohorts fulfilled one to three of the five independency criteria. The diagnostic performance of the algorithms used as standalones was good, challenging that of human reading. In the 12 studies with predefined diagnostic thresholds, radiomics-based computer-aided diagnosis systems (assessing regions-of-interest drawn by the radiologist) tended to provide more robust results than deep learning-based computer-aided detection systems (providing probability maps). Two of the six studies comparing unassisted and assisted reading showed significant improvement due to the algorithm, mostly by reducing false positive findings.\nProstate MRI AI-based algorithms showed promising results, especially for the relatively simple task of characterizing predefined lesions. The best management of discrepancies between human reading and algorithm findings still needs to be defined.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) facilitates scientists to devise intelligent machines that work and behave like humans to resolve difficulties and problems by utilizing minimal resources. The Healthcare sector has benefited due to this. Mosquito-transmitted diseases pose a significant health risk. Despite all advances, present strategies for curbing these diseases still depend largely on controlling the mosquito vectors. This strategy demands an army of entomology experts for thorough monitoring, determining, and finally eradicating the targeted mosquito population. Deep learning (DL) algorithms may substitute such unmanageable processes. The current review focuses on how AI, with particular emphasis on deep learning, demonstrates effectiveness in quick detection, identification, monitoring, and finally controlling the target mosquito populations with minimal resources. It accelerates the pace of operation and data exploration on ongoing evolutionary status, tendency to feed blood, and age grading of mosquitoes. The successful combination of computer and biological sciences will provide practical insight and generate a new research niche in this study area.",

    "abstract": "To compare the performances of artificial intelligence (AI) to those of radiologists in wrist fracture detection on radiographs.\nThis retrospective study included 637 patients (1917 radiographs) with wrist trauma between January 2017 and December 2019. The AI software used was a deep neuronal network algorithm. Ground truth was established by three senior musculoskeletal radiologists who compared the initial radiology reports (IRR) made by non-specialized radiologists, the results of AI, and the combination of AI and IRR (IR+AI) RESULTS: A total of 318 fractures were reported by the senior radiologists in 247 patients. Sensitivity of AI (83%; 95% CI: 78-87%) was significantly greater than that of IRR (76%; 95% CI: 70-81%) (p < 0.001). Specificities were similar for AI (96%; 95% CI: 93-97%) and for IRR (96%; 95% CI: 94-98%) (p = 0.80). The combination of AI+IRR had a significantly greater sensitivity (88%; 95% CI: 84-92%) compared to AI and IRR (p < 0.001) and a lower specificity (92%; 95% CI: 89-95%) (p < 0.001). The sensitivity for scaphoid fracture detection was acceptable for AI (84%) and IRR (80%) but poor for the detection of other carpal bones fracture (41% for AI and 26% for IRR).\nPerformance of AI in wrist fracture detection on radiographs is better than that of non-specialized radiologists. The combination of AI and radiologist's analysis yields best performances.\n\u2022 Artificial intelligence has better performances for wrist fracture detection compared to non-expert radiologists in daily practice. \u2022 Performance of artificial intelligence greatly differs depending on the anatomical area. \u2022 Sensitivity of artificial intelligence for the detection of carpal bones fractures is 56%.",

    "abstract": "Genitourinary (GU) system is among the most commonly involved malignancy sites in the human body. Imaging plays a crucial role not only in diagnosis of cancer but also in disease management and its prognosis. However, interpretation of conventional imaging methods such as CT or MR imaging (MRI) usually demonstrates variability across different readers and institutions. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising technology that could improve the patient care by providing helpful input to human readers through lesion detection algorithms and lesion classification systems. Moreover, the robustness of these models may be valuable in automating time-consuming tasks such as organ and lesion segmentations. Herein, we review the current state of imaging and existing challenges in GU malignancies, particularly for cancers of prostate, kidney and bladder; and briefly summarize the recent AI-based solutions to these challenges.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive science has been traditionally organized around the individual as the basic unit of cognition. Despite developments in areas such as communication, human-machine interaction, group behavior, and community organization, the individual-centric approach heavily dominates both cognitive research and its application. A promising direction for cognitive science is the study of augmented intelligence, or the way social and technological systems interact with and extend individual cognition. The cognitive science of augmented intelligence holds promise in helping society tackle major real-world challenges that can only be discovered and solved by teams made of individuals and machines with complementary skills who can productively collaborate with each other.",

Over the past decade, advances in computing power and the rapid development of neural networks, open-source software packages, and data science have been realized and resulted in new research and clinical applications of artificial intelligent (AI) systems in radiation oncology. These technologies differ from conventional software in their level of complexity and ability to learn from representative and local data. We provide clinical and research application examples of AI in human radiation oncology and their potential applications in veterinary medicine throughout the patient's care-path: from treatment simulation, deformable registration, auto-segmentation, automated treatment planning and plan selection, quality assurance, adaptive radiotherapy, and outcomes modeling. These technologies have the potential to offer significant time and cost savings in the veterinary setting; however, since the range of usefulness of these technologies have not been well studied nor understood, care must be taken if adopting AI technologies in clinical practice. Over the next several years, some practical and realizable applications of AI in veterinary radiation oncology include automated segmentation of normal tissues and tumor volumes, deformable registration, multi-criteria plan optimization, and adaptive radiotherapy. Keys in achieving success in adopting AI in veterinary radiation oncology include: establishing \"truth-data\"; data harmonization; multi-institutional data and collaborations; standardized dose reporting and taxonomy; adopting an open access philosophy, data collection and curation; open-source algorithm development; and transparent and platform-independent code development.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are novel technologies that will change the way veterinary medicine is practiced. Exactly how this change will occur is yet to be determined, and, as is the nature with disruptive technologies, will be difficult to predict. Ushering in this new tool in a conscientious way will require knowledge of the terminology and types of AI as well as forward thinking regarding the ethical and legal implications within the profession. Developers as well as end users will need to consider the ethical and legal components alongside functional creation of algorithms in order to foster acceptance and adoption, and most importantly to prevent patient harm. There are key differences in deployment of these technologies in veterinary medicine relative to human healthcare, namely our ability to perform euthanasia, and the lack of regulatory validation to bring these technologies to market. These differences along with others create a much different landscape than AI use in human medicine, and necessitate proactive planning in order to prevent catastrophic outcomes, encourage development and adoption, and protect the profession from unnecessary liability. The authors offer that deploying these technologies prior to considering the larger ethical and legal implications and without stringent validation is putting the AI cart before the horse, and risks putting patients and the profession in harm's way.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used for applications in veterinary radiology, including detection of abnormalities and automated measurements. Unlike human radiology, there is no formal regulation or validation of AI algorithms for veterinary medicine and both general practitioner and specialist veterinarians must rely on their own judgment when deciding whether or not to incorporate AI algorithms to aid their clinical decision-making. The benefits and challenges to developing clinically useful and diagnostically accurate AI algorithms are discussed. Considerations for the development of AI research projects are also addressed. A framework is suggested to help veterinarians, in both research and clinical practice contexts, assess AI algorithms for veterinary radiology.",

    "abstract": "Evidence-based medicine, outcomes management, and multidisciplinary systems are laying the foundation for radiology on the cusp of a new day. Environmental and operational forces coupled with technological advancements are redefining the veterinary radiologist of tomorrow. In the past several years, veterinary image volumes have exploded, and the scale of hardware and software required to support it seems boundless. The most dynamic trend within veterinary radiology is implementing digital information systems such as PACS, RIS, PIMS, and Voice Recognition systems. While the digitization of radiography imaging has significantly improved the workflow of the veterinary radiology assistant and radiologist, tedious, redundant tasks are abundant and mind-numbing. They can lead to errors with a significant impact on patient care.\u00a0 Today, these boring and repetitious tasks continue to bog down patient throughput and workflow. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning, shows much promise to rocket the workflow and veterinary clinical imaging into a new day where the AI management of mundane tasks allows for efficiency so the radiologist can better concentrate on the quality of patient care. In this article, we briefly discuss the major subsets of artificial intelligence (AI) workflow for the radiologist and veterinary radiology assistant including image acquisition, segmentation and mensuration, rotation and hanging protocol, detection and prioritization, monitoring and registration of lesions, implementation of these subsets, and the ethics of utilizing AI in veterinary medicine.",

    "abstract": "The main aim of this study was to analyze the performance of different artificial intelligence (AI) models in endoscopic colonic polyp detection and classification and compare them with doctors with different experience.\nWe searched the studies on Colonoscopy, Colonic Polyps, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning published before May 2020 in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and the citation index of the conference proceedings. The quality of studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 table of diagnostic test quality evaluation criteria. The random-effects model was calculated using Meta-DISC 1.4 and RevMan 5.3.\nA total of 16 studies were included for meta-analysis. Only one study (1/16) presented externally validated results. The area under the curve (AUC) of AI group, expert group and non-expert group for detection and classification of colonic polyps were 0.940, 0.918, and 0.871, respectively. AI group had slightly lower pooled specificity than the expert group (79% vs. 86%, P\u2009<\u20090.05), but the pooled sensitivity was higher than the expert group (88% vs. 80%, P\u2009<\u20090.05). While the non-experts had less pooled specificity in polyp recognition than the experts (81% vs. 86%, P\u2009<\u20090.05), and higher pooled sensitivity than the experts (85% vs. 80%, P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nThe performance of AI in polyp detection and classification is similar to that of human experts, with high sensitivity and moderate specificity. Different tasks may have an impact on the performance of deep learning models and human experts, especially in terms of sensitivity and specificity.",

    "abstract": "With the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, smart health monitoring, particularly neonatal cardiorespiratory monitoring with wearable devices, is becoming more popular. To this end, it is crucial to investigate the trend of AI and wearable sensors being developed in this domain.\nWe performed a review of papers published in IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and PubMed from the year 2000 onwards, to understand the use of AI for neonatal cardiorespiratory monitoring with wearable technologies. We reviewed the advances in AI development for this application and potential future directions. For this review, we assimilated machine learning (ML) algorithms developed for neonatal cardiorespiratory monitoring, designed a taxonomy, and categorised the methods based on their learning capabilities and performance.\nFor AI\u00a0related to wearable technologies for neonatal cardio-respiratory monitoring, 63% of studies utilised traditional ML techniques and 35% utilised deep learning techniques, including 6% that applied transfer learning on pre-trained models.\nA detailed review of AI methods for neonatal cardiorespiratory wearable sensors is presented along with their advantages and disadvantages. Hierarchical models and suggestions for future developments are highlighted to translate these AI technologies into patient benefit.\nState-of-the-art review in artificial intelligence used for wearable neonatal cardiorespiratory monitoring.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad concept that usually refers to computer programs that can learn from data and perform certain specific tasks. In the recent years, the growth of deep learning, a successful technique for computer vision tasks that does not require explicit programming, coupled with the availability of large imaging databases fostered the development of multiple applications in the medical imaging field, especially for lung nodules and lung cancer, mostly through convolutional neural networks (CNN). Some of the first applications of AI is this field were dedicated to automated detection of lung nodules on X-ray and computed tomography (CT) examinations, with performances now reaching or exceeding those of radiologists. For lung nodule segmentation, CNN-based algorithms applied to CT images show excellent spatial overlap index with manual segmentation, even for irregular and ground glass nodules. A third application of AI is the classification of lung nodules between malignant and benign, which could limit the number of follow-up CT examinations for less suspicious lesions. Several algorithms have demonstrated excellent capabilities for the prediction of the malignancy risk when a nodule is discovered. These different applications of AI for lung nodules are particularly appealing in the context of lung cancer screening. In the field of lung cancer, AI tools applied to lung imaging have been investigated for distinct aims. First, they could play a role for the non-invasive characterization of tumors, especially for histological subtype and somatic mutation predictions, with a potential therapeutic impact. Additionally, they could help predict the patient prognosis, in combination to clinical data. Despite these encouraging perspectives, clinical implementation of AI tools is only beginning because of the lack of generalizability of published studies, of an inner obscure working and because of limited data about the impact of such tools on the radiologists' decision and on the patient outcome. Radiologists must be active participants in the process of evaluating AI tools, as such tools could support their daily work and offer them more time for high added value tasks.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare has well-known challenges with safety, quality, and effectiveness, and many see artificial intelligence (AI) as essential to any solution. Emerging applications include the automated synthesis of best-practice research evidence including systematic reviews, which would ultimately see all clinical trial data published in a computational form for immediate synthesis. Digital scribes embed themselves in the process of care to detect, record, and summarize events and conversations for the electronic record. However, three persistent translational challenges must be addressed before AI is widely deployed. First, little effort is spent replicating AI trials, exposing patients to risks of methodological error and biases. Next, there is little reporting of patient harms from trials. Finally, AI built using machine learning may perform less effectively in different clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Brain cancer is a destructive and life-threatening disease that imposes immense negative effects on patients' lives. Therefore, the detection of brain tumors at an early stage improves the impact of treatments and increases the patients survival rates. However, detecting brain tumors in their initial stages is a demanding task and an unmet need.\nThe present study presents a comprehensive review of the recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods of diagnosing brain tumors using MRI images. These AI techniques can be divided into Supervised, Unsupervised, and Deep Learning (DL) methods.\nDiagnosing and segmenting brain tumors usually begin with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) on the brain since MRI is a noninvasive imaging technique. Another existing challenge is that the growth of technology is faster than the rate of increase in the number of medical staff who can employ these technologies. It has resulted in an increased risk of diagnostic misinterpretation. Therefore, developing robust automated brain tumor detection techniques has been studied widely over the past years.\nThe current review provides an analysis of the performance of modern methods in this area. Moreover, various image segmentation methods in addition to the recent efforts of researchers are summarized. Finally, the paper discusses open questions and suggests directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Physical trauma-related mortality places a heavy burden on society. Estimating the mortality risk in physical trauma patients is crucial to enhance treatment efficiency and reduce this burden. The most popular and accurate model is the Injury Severity Score (ISS), which is based on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), an anatomical injury severity scoring system. However, the AIS requires specialists to code the injury scale by reviewing a patient's medical record; therefore, applying the model to every hospital is impossible.\nWe aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict in-hospital mortality in physical trauma patients using the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10), triage scale, procedure codes, and other clinical features.\nWe used the Korean National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) data set (N=778,111) compiled from over 400 hospitals between 2016 and 2019. To predict in-hospital mortality, we used the following as input features: ICD-10, patient age, gender, intentionality, injury mechanism, and emergent symptom, Alert/Verbal/Painful/Unresponsive (AVPU) scale, Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS), and procedure codes. We proposed the ensemble of deep neural networks (EDNN) via 5-fold cross-validation and compared them with other state-of-the-art machine learning models, including traditional prediction models. We further investigated the effect of the features.\nOur proposed EDNN with all features provided the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.9507, outperforming other state-of-the-art models, including the following traditional prediction models: Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost; AUROC of 0.9433), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost; AUROC of 0.9331), ICD-based ISS (AUROC of 0.8699 for an inclusive model and AUROC of 0.8224 for an exclusive model), and KTAS (AUROC of 0.1841). In addition, using all features yielded a higher AUROC than any other partial features, namely, EDNN with the features of ICD-10 only (AUROC of 0.8964) and EDNN with the features excluding ICD-10 (AUROC of 0.9383).\nOur proposed EDNN with all features outperforms other state-of-the-art models, including the traditional diagnostic code-based prediction model and triage scale.",

    "abstract": "To develop an artificial intelligence-based model to predict recurrence after curative resection for stage I-III colorectal cancer from digitized pathological slides.\nIn this retrospective study, 471 consecutive patients who underwent curative resection for stage I-III colorectal cancer at our institution from 2004 to 2015 were enrolled, and 512 randomly selected tiles from digitally scanned images of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tumor tissue sections were used to train a convolutional neural network. Five-fold cross-validation was used to validate the model. The association between recurrence and the model's output scores were analyzed in the test cohorts.\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the cross-validation was 0.7245 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6707-0.7783; P\u2009<\u20090.0001]. The score successfully classified patients into those with better and worse recurrence free survival (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that a high score was significantly associated with worse recurrence free survival [odds ratio (OR) 1.857; 95% CI 1.248-2.805; P\u2009=\u20090.0021], which was independent from other predictive factors: male sex (P\u2009=\u20090.0238), rectal cancer (P\u2009=\u20090.0396), preoperative abnormal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (P\u2009=\u20090.0216), pathological T3/T4 stage (P\u2009=\u20090.0162), and pathological positive lymph node metastasis (P\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nThe artificial intelligence-based prediction model discriminated patients with a high risk of recurrence. This approach could help decision-makers consider the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "New technologies enable the creation of digital twin systems (DTS) combining continuous data collection from children's home and artificial intelligence (AI)-based recommendations to adapt their care in real time. The objective was to assess whether children and adolescents with asthma would be ready to use such DTS. A mixed-method study was conducted with 104 asthma patients aged 8 to 17\u00a0years. The potential advantages and disadvantages associated with AI and the use of DTS were collected in semi-structured interviews. Children were then asked whether they would agree to use a DTS for the daily management of their asthma. The strength of their decision was assessed as well as the factors determining their choice. The main advantages of DTS identified by children were the possibility to be (i) supported in managing their asthma (ii) from home and (iii) in real time. Technical issues and the risk of loss of humanity were the main drawbacks reported. Half of the children (56%) were willing to use a DTS for the daily management of their asthma if it was as effective as current care, and up to 93% if it was more effective. Those with the best computer skills were more likely to choose the DTS, while those who placed a high value on the physician-patient relationship were less likely to do so.\u00a0 \u00a0Conclusions: The majority of children were ready to use a DTS for the management of their asthma, particularly if it was more effective than current care. The results of this study support the development of DTS for childhood asthma and the evaluation of their effectiveness in clinical trials. What is Known: \u2022 New technologies enable the creation of digital twin systems (DTS) for children with asthma. \u2022 Acceptance of these DTSs by children with asthma is unknown. What is New: \u2022 Half of the children (56%) were willing to use a DTS for the daily management of their asthma if it was as effective as current care, and up to 93% if it was more effective. \u2022Children identified the ability to be supported from home and in real time as the main benefits of DTS.",

    "abstract": "Background CT is the standard method used to assess bronchiectasis. A higher airway-to-artery diameter ratio (AAR) is typically used to identify enlarged bronchi and bronchiectasis; however, current imaging methods are limited in assessing the extent of this metric in CT scans. Purpose To determine the extent of AARs using an artificial intelligence-based chest CT and assess the association of AARs with exacerbations over time. Materials and Methods In a secondary analysis of ever-smokers from the prospective, observational, multicenter COPDGene study, AARs were quantified using an artificial intelligence tool. The percentage of airways with AAR greater than 1 (a measure of airway dilatation) in each participant on chest CT scans was determined. Pulmonary exacerbations were prospectively determined through biannual follow-up (from July 2009 to September 2021). Multivariable zero-inflated regression models were used to assess the association between the percentage of airways with AAR greater than 1 and the total number of pulmonary exacerbations over follow-up. Covariates included demographics, lung function, and conventional CT parameters. Results Among 4192 participants (median age, 59 years; IQR, 52-67 years; 1878 men [45%]), 1834 had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). During a 10-year follow-up and in adjusted models, the percentage of airways with AARs greater than 1 (quartile 4 vs 1) was associated with a higher total number of exacerbations (risk ratio [RR], 1.08; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.15; ",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to check the practical feasibility of artificial intelligence for day-to-day operations and how it generalizes when the data have considerable interobserver variability.\nAutomated delineation of organ at risk (OAR) using a deep learning model is reasonably accurate. This will considerably reduce the medical professional time in manually contouring the OAR and also reduce the interobserver variation among radiation oncologists. It allows for quick radiation planning which helps in adaptive radiotherapy planning.\nHead and neck (HN) computed tomography (CT) scan data of 113 patients were used in this study. CT scan was done as per the institute protocol. Each patient had about 100-300 slices in Dicom format. A total number of 19,240 images were used as the data set. The OARs were delineated by the radiation oncologist in the contouring system. Of the 113 patient records, 13 records were kept aside as test dataset and the remaining 100 records were used for training the UNet 2D model. The study was performed on the spinal cord and left and right parotids as OARs on HN CT images. The model performance was quantified using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) score.\nThe trained model is used to predict three OARs, spinal cord and left and right parotids. The DSC score of 84% and above could be achieved using the UNet 2D Convolutional Neural Network.\nThis study showed that the accuracy of predicted organs was within acceptable DSC scores, even when the underlying dataset has significant interobserver variability.",

Therefore, the objective is to analyze the bibliometric characteristics of the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in tuberculosis in Scopus.\nA bibliometric study, the Scopus database was used using a search strategy composed of controlled and free terms regarding tuberculosis and AI. The search fields \"TITLE,\" \"ABSTRACT,\" and \"AUTHKEY\" were used to find the terms. The collected data were analyzed with Scival software. Bibliometric data were described through the figures and tables summarized by absolute values and percentages.\nThousand and forty-one documents were collected and analyzed. Yudong Zhang was the author with the highest scientific production; however, K. C. Santosh had the greatest impact. Anna University (India) was the institution with the highest number of published papers. Most papers were published in the first quartile. The United States led the scientific production. Articles with international collaboration had the highest impact.\nArticles related to tuberculosis and AI are mostly published in first quartile journals, which would reflect the need and interest worldwide. Although countries with a high incidence of new cases of tuberculosis are among the most productive, those with the highest reported drug resistance need greater support and collaboration.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that predominantly affects the synovial joints, causing joint destruction, pain, and disability. Historically, the standard for measuring the long-term efficacy of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs has been the assessment of plain radiographs with scoring techniques that quantify joint damage. However, with significant improvements in therapy, current radiographic scoring systems may no longer be fit for purpose for the milder spectrum of disease seen today. We argue that artificial intelligence is an apt solution to further improve upon radiographic scoring, as it can readily learn to recognize subtle patterns in imaging data to not only improve efficiency, but can also increase the sensitivity to variation in mild disease. Current work in the area demonstrates the feasibility of automating scoring but is yet to take full advantage of the strengths of artificial intelligence. By fully leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, faster and more sensitive scoring could enable the ongoing development of effective treatments for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are transforming the optimization of clinical and patient workflows in healthcare. There is a need for research to specify clinical requirements for AI-enhanced care pathway planning and scheduling systems to improve human-AI interaction in machine learning applications. The aim of this study was to assess content validity and prioritize the most relevant functionalities of an AI-enhanced care pathway planning and scheduling system.\nA prospective content validity assessment was conducted in five university hospitals in three different countries using an electronic survey. The content of the survey was formed from clinical requirements, which were formulated into generic statements of required AI functionalities. The relevancy of each statement was evaluated using a content validity index. In addition, weighted ranking points were calculated to prioritize the most relevant functionalities of an AI-enhanced care pathway planning and scheduling system.\nA total of 50 responses were received from clinical professionals from three European countries. An item-level content validity index ranged from 0.42 to 0.96. 45% of the generic statements were considered good. The highest ranked functionalities for an AI-enhanced care pathway planning and scheduling system were related to risk assessment, patient profiling, and resources. The highest ranked functionalities for the user interface were related to the explainability of machine learning models.\nThis study provided a comprehensive list of functionalities that can be used to design future AI-enhanced solutions and evaluate the designed solutions against requirements. The relevance of statements concerning the AI functionalities were considered somewhat relevant, which might be due to the low level or organizational readiness for AI in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "The hype around artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology continues and the number of approved AI tools is growing steadily. Despite the great potential, integration into clinical routine in radiology remains limited. In addition, the large number of individual applications poses a\u00a0challenge for clinical routine, as individual applications have to be selected for different questions and organ systems, which increases the complexity and time required.\nThis review will discuss the current status of validation and implementation of AI tools in clinical routine, and identify possible approaches for an improved assessment of the generalizability of results of AI tools.\nA literature search in various literature and product databases as well as publications, position papers, and reports from various stakeholders was conducted for this review.\nScientific evidence and independent validation studies are available for only a\u00a0few commercial AI tools and the generalizability of the results often remains questionable.\nOne challenge is the multitude of offerings for individual, specific application areas by a\u00a0large number of manufacturers, making integration into the existing site-specific IT infrastructure more difficult. Furthermore, remuneration for the use of AI tools in clinical routine by health insurance companies in Germany is lacking. But in order for reimbursement to be granted, the clinical utility of new applications must first be proven. Such proof, however, is lacking for most applications.\nHINTERGRUND: Der Hype um k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz (KI) in der Radiologie ist ungebrochen, und die Anzahl an zugelassenen KI-Tools w\u00e4chst stetig.

Zudem bildet die Vielzahl an Einzelanwendungen eine Herausforderung f\u00fcr die klinische Routine, da f\u00fcr verschiedene Fragestellungen und Organsysteme einzelne Anwendungen angew\u00e4hlt werden m\u00fcssen, was die Komplexit\u00e4t und den Zeitaufwand erh\u00f6ht.\nIn dieser \u00dcbersichtsarbeit soll der aktuelle Stand der Validierung und Implementierung von KI-Tools in die klinische Routine mit den aktuellen Limitationen aufgezeigt werden. Au\u00dferdem sollen m\u00f6gliche L\u00f6sungsans\u00e4tze f\u00fcr eine verbesserte Evaluation der Generalisierbarkeit von Ergebnissen der KI-Tools diskutiert werden.\nF\u00fcr diese \u00dcbersichtsarbeit wurde eine Recherche in verschiedenen Literatur- und Produktdatenbanken sowie in Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen, Positionspapieren und Berichten von verschiedenen Interessensgruppen durchgef\u00fchrt.\nF\u00fcr nur wenige kommerzielle KI-Tools sind wissenschaftliche Evidenz und unabh\u00e4ngige Validierungsstudien vorhanden. Zudem bleibt h\u00e4ufig die Generalisierbarkeit der Ergebnisse fraglich.\nEin Problem besteht in der Vielzahl an Angeboten f\u00fcr einzelne, spezifische Anwendungsgebiete durch eine Vielzahl an Herstellern und die dadurch erschwerte Integration in die bestehende standortindividuelle IT-Infrastruktur. Ein weiteres Problem ist die fehlende wirtschaftliche Verg\u00fctung f\u00fcr den Einsatz von KI-Tools in der klinischen Routine durch die Krankenkassen in Deutschland. F\u00fcr eine Verg\u00fctung muss jedoch zun\u00e4chst der klinische Nutzen neuer Anwendungen nachgewiesen werden. Ein solcher Nachweis wiederum fehlt f\u00fcr die meisten Applikationen.",

    "abstract": "Nations worldwide are mobilizing to harness the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) given its massive potential to shape global competitiveness over the coming decades. Using a dataset of 2.2 million AI papers, we study inter-city citations, collaborations, and talent migrations to uncover dependencies between Eastern and Western cities worldwide. Beijing emerges as a clear outlier, as it has been the most impactful city since 2007, the most productive since 2002, and the one housing the largest number of AI scientists since 1995. Our analysis also reveals that Western cities cite each other far more frequently than expected by chance, East-East collaborations are far more common than East-West or West-West collaborations, and migration of AI scientists mostly takes place from one Eastern city to another. We then propose a measure that quantifies each city's role in bridging East and West. Beijing's role surpasses that of all other cities combined, making it the central gateway through which knowledge and talent flow from one side to the other. We also track the center of mass of AI research by weighing each city's geographic location by its impact, productivity, and AI workforce. The center of mass has moved thousands of kilometers eastward over the past three decades, with Beijing's pull increasing each year. These findings highlight the eastward shift in the tides of global AI research, and the growing role of the Chinese capital as a hub connecting researchers across the globe.",

    "abstract": "The formation of gas condensate near the wellbore affects the gas liquid two-phase flow between the pores. It may occur in the path between two pores depending on the thermodynamic conditions of the single-phase gas flow, two-phase gas liquid annular flow or the closed path of condensate in the throat. To model the behavior of gas condensate in a network of pores, relative permeability and naturally pressure drop should be calculated. This study obtained the flow characteristics (pressure drop) between the pores at different physical and geometric conditions using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD is time-consuming, so its results were transferred to an artificial neural network (ANN) model and the ANN model was trained. The CFD was replaced with the ANN model for calculating the pressure drop. In addition, instead of utilizing empirical correlations to compute the accurate value of condensate formed in throats' corners at every time step, the flash calculation using Esmaeilzadeh-Roshanfekr equation of state was performed, and closed throats were specified. This accurately estimates gas and condensate distribution in the pore network. Furthermore, the value of condensate that transferred to the adjacent throats was computed using Poiseuille's law. The results showed that the proposed ANN-based proxy model could promote the calculation speed in gas condensate simulation, considering the dynamic change of relative permeability curves as a function of gas condensate saturation. Also, it was found that the relative permeability obtained by the proposed model is in good agreement with the experimental data. By entering the fractures pattern in the network model and predicting the relative permeability of gas and condensate by the proposed method, the role of fractures in gas condensate production in such reservoirs could be predicted. Dynamic changes due to the relative permeability of gas and condensate as a function of saturation can be entered into the reservoir simulation to optimize inertia and positive coupling phenomena to maximized condensate production in gas condensate reservoir.",

    "abstract": "The last two decades have witnessed an extraordinary evolution of automation and artificial intelligence (AI), which has become an integral part of our daily lives. Lately, AI has also been assimilated in the field of medicine to upgrade overall healthcare system and encourage personalized treatment. Theranostics literally meaning combination of diagnosis and therapeutics, is a targeted pharmacotherapy, based on specific targeted diagnostic tests. Numerous theranostic agents/biomarkers are available which can identify the most beneficial treatment, correct dose or predict response to a medicine, thus, maximizing drug efficacy, minimizing toxicity and providing informed treatment choice. For instance, a statistics based Cluster-FLIM technology provides precise data on drug-receptor binding behavior in biological tissues using fluorescence real experimental imaging. Automated Idylla\u2122 qPCR System is another approach in oncology to determine the EGFR mutations at initial stage as well as during the treatment and also assists the oncologist in designing the treatment protocol. Recent incorporation of automation and AI in theranostics has brought a drastic change in early detection and treatment protocols for various diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Also, it leads to quick analysis of number of diverse experimental datum with accuracy. The approach mainly uses computer algorithms to unveil relevant and significant information from clinical data, thereby assisting in making accurate, logical and pertinent decisions. This review highlights the emerging uses/role of automation and AI in theranostics, technical difficulties and focuses on its future prospects to facilitate a patient specific, reliable and efficient pharmacotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Although narrow-band imaging (NBI) is a useful modality for detecting and delineating esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), there is a risk of incorrectly determining the margins of some lesions even with NBI. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system for detecting superficial ESCC and precancerous lesions and delineating the extent of lesions under NBI.\nNonmagnified NBI images from 4 hospitals were collected and annotated. Internal and external image test datasets were used to evaluate the detection and delineation performance of the system. The delineation performance of the system was compared with that of endoscopists. Furthermore, the system was directly integrated into the endoscopy equipment, and its real-time diagnostic capability was prospectively estimated.\nThe system was trained and tested using 10,047 still images and 140 videos from 1112 patients and 1183 lesions. In the image testing, the accuracy of the system in detecting lesions in internal and external tests was 92.4% and 89.9%, respectively. The accuracy of the system in delineating extents in internal and external tests was 88.9% and 87.0%, respectively. The delineation performance of the system was superior to that of junior endoscopists and similar to that of senior endoscopists. In the prospective clinical evaluation, the system exhibited satisfactory performance, with an accuracy of 91.4% in detecting lesions and an accuracy of 85.9% in delineating extents.\nThe proposed AI system could accurately detect superficial ESCC and precancerous lesions and delineate the extent of lesions under NBI.",

    "abstract": "The effect of spatial nonuniformity of the temperature distribution was examined on the capability of machine-learning algorithms to provide accurate temperature prediction based on Laser Absorption Spectroscopy. First, sixteen machine learning models were trained as surrogate models of conventional physical methods to measure temperature from uniform temperature distributions (uniform-profile spectra). The best three of them, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), VGG13, and Boosted Random Forest (BRF) were shown to work excellently on uniform profiles but their performance degraded tremendously on nonuniform-profile spectra. This indicated that directly using uniform-profile-targeted methods to nonuniform profiles was improper. However, after retraining models on nonuniform-profile data, the models of GPR and VGG13, which utilized all features of the spectra, not only showed good accuracy and sensitivity to spectral twins, but also showed excellent generalization performance on spectra of increased nonuniformity, which demonstrated that the negative effects of nonuniformity on temperature measurement could be overcome. In contrast, BRF, which utilized partial features, did not have good generalization performance, which implied the nonuniformity level had impact on regional features of spectra. By reducing the data dimensionality through T-SNE and LDA, the visualizations of the data in two-dimensional feature spaces demonstrated that two datasets of substantially different levels of non-uniformity shared very closely similar distributions in terms of both spectral appearance and spectrum-temperature mapping. Notably, datasets from uniform and nonuniform temperature distributions clustered in two different areas of the 2D spaces of the t-SNE and LDA features with very few samples overlapping.",

    "abstract": "Conventional risk score for predicting in-hospital mortality following Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is not catered for Asian patients and requires different types of scoring algorithms for STEMI and NSTEMI patients.\nTo derive a single algorithm using deep learning and machine learning for the prediction and identification of factors associated with in-hospital mortality in Asian patients with ACS and to compare performance to a conventional risk score.\nThe Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Database (NCVD) registry, is a multi-ethnic, heterogeneous database spanning from 2006-2017. It was used for in-hospital mortality model development with 54 variables considered for patients with STEMI and Non-STEMI (NSTEMI). Mortality prediction was analyzed using feature selection methods with machine learning algorithms. Deep learning algorithm using features selected from machine learning was compared to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score.\nA total of 68528 patients were included in the analysis. Deep learning models constructed using all features and selected features from machine learning resulted in higher performance than machine learning and TIMI risk score (p < 0.0001 for all). The best model in this study is the combination of features selected from the SVM algorithm with a deep learning classifier. The DL (SVM selected var) algorithm demonstrated the highest predictive performance with the least number of predictors (14 predictors) for in-hospital prediction of STEMI patients (AUC = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.95-0.96). In NSTEMI in-hospital prediction, DL (RF selected var) (AUC = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.95-0.96, reported slightly higher AUC compared to DL (SVM selected var) (AUC = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.94-0.95). There was no significant difference between DL (SVM selected var) algorithm and DL (RF selected var) algorithm (p = 0.5). When compared to the DL (SVM selected var) model, the TIMI score underestimates patients' risk of mortality. TIMI risk score correctly identified 13.08% of the high-risk patient's non-survival vs 24.7% for the DL model and 4.65% vs 19.7% of the high-risk patient's non-survival for NSTEMI. Age, heart rate, Killip class, cardiac catheterization, oral hypoglycemia use and antiarrhythmic agent were found to be common predictors of in-hospital mortality across all ML feature selection models in this study. The final algorithm was converted into an online tool with a database for continuous data archiving for prospective validation.\nACS patients were better classified using a combination of machine learning and deep learning in a multi-ethnic Asian population when compared to TIMI scoring. Machine learning enables the identification of distinct factors in individual Asian populations to improve mortality prediction. Continuous testing and validation will allow for better risk stratification in the future, potentially altering management and outcomes.",

TIMI risk score correctly identified 13.08% of the high-risk patient's non-survival vs 24.7% for the DL model and 4.65% vs 19.7% of the high-risk patient's non-survival for NSTEMI. Age, heart rate, Killip class, cardiac catheterization, oral hypoglycemia use and antiarrhythmic agent were found to be common predictors of in-hospital mortality across all ML feature selection models in this study. The final algorithm was converted into an online tool with a database for continuous data archiving for prospective validation.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the feasibility of using a smartphone-based care management platform (sbCMP) and robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (raTKA) to collect data throughout the episode-of-care and assess if intra-operative measures of soft tissue laxity in raTKA were associated with post-operative outcomes.\nA secondary data analysis of 131 patients in a commercial database who underwent raTKA was performed. Pre-operative through six\u00a0week post-operative step counts and KOOS JR scores were collected and cross-referenced with intra-operative laxity measures. A Kruskal-Wallis test or a Wilcoxon sign-rank was used to assess outcomes.\nThere were higher step counts at six\u00a0weeks post-operatively in knees with increased laxity in both the lateral compartment in extension and medial compartment in flexion (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Knees balanced in flexion within\u2009<\u20090.5\u00a0mm had higher KOOS JR scores at six\u00a0weeks post-operative (p\u2009=\u20090.034) compared to knees balanced within 0.5-1.5\u00a0mm.\nA smartphone-based care management platform can be integrated with raTKA to passively collect data throughout the episode-of-care. Associations between intra-operative decisions regarding laxity and post-operative outcomes were identified. However, more robust analysis is needed to evaluate these associations and ensure clinical relevance to guide machine learning algorithms.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, new studies based on artificial intelligence (AI) have been conducted in the forensic field, posing new challenges and demonstrating the advantages and disadvantages of using AI methodologies to solve forensic well-known problems. Specifically, AI technology has tried to overcome the human subjective bias limitations of the traditional approach of the forensic sciences, which include sex prediction and age estimation from morphometric measurements in forensic anthropology or evaluating the third molar stage of development in forensic odontology. Likewise, AI has been studied as an assisting tool in forensic pathology for a quick and easy identification of the taxonomy of diatoms. The present systematic review follows the PRISMA 2020 statements and aims to explore an emerging topic that has been poorly analyzed in the forensic literature. Benefits, limitations, and forensic implications concerning AI are therefore highlighted, by providing an extensive critical review of its current applications on forensic sciences as well as its future directions. Results are divided into 5 subsections which included forensic anthropology, forensic odontology, forensic pathology, forensic genetics, and other forensic branches. The discussion offers a useful instrument to investigate the potential benefits of AI in the forensic fields as well as to point out the existing open questions and issues concerning its application on real-life scenarios. Procedural notes and technical aspects are also provided to the readers.",

    "abstract": "Intelligence is strongly associated with working memory. Working memory training can improve fluid intelligence, but the underlying mechanism requires further investigation. Because inhibition control may play a key role in working memory training, this study investigated this process from an electrophysiological perspective. In total, 40 children aged 9 to 11\u2009years were enrolled and randomly divided into a training group (n\u2009=\u200920) and a control group (n\u2009=\u200920). The training group received 20\u2009days of working memory training, whereas the control group did not receive any training. Before and after the training period, all participants were tested using Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM), and electrophysiological indicators were recorded while they performed go/no-go and Stroop tasks. The results revealed that relative to the control group, the training group had significantly improved RSPM scores in the test conducted after their training. For the go/no-go tasks, the training group exhibited a significant decrease in N2 amplitude, a significant increase in P3 amplitude, a significant decrease in theta band energy, and an improvement in response inhibition ability. No significant change was observed for the Stroop task. Correlation analysis revealed that an improvement in individual response inhibition can positively predict an improvement in fluid intelligence. These results suggest that working memory training enhances the fluid intelligence of children by enhancing their response inhibition ability.",

    "abstract": "To establish an automatic approach for the measurement of the Cobb angle and the diagnosis of scoliosis on chest radiograph.\nWe developed an artificial intelligence (AI) automatic program which contained a supervised learning module and an inference module. After the filtering and pre-processing process, 96 images from the Shenzhen chest X-ray set were used for training with the supervised learning module, and 491 test images were separately gauged by the AI and the corresponding manual methods. The results of the two methods were further compared through statistical analyses.\nAmong the test images, 6068 (99.49%) vertebral bodies were identified within the deviation of one vertebral segment. The value difference between the Cobb angle obtained by the AI program and that measured by specialists was 0.4020\u00b10.8703. The intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.915 indicated the strong agreement. AI scoliosis diagnosis achieved an accuracy of 98.37%, with a specificity of 98.73%, a sensitivity of 88.24% and a kappa coefficient of 0.781. And the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.979 confirmed the consistency of the two methods in diagnosis.\nWe developed a novel automatic AI method with the abilities to measure the Cobb angle, and to identify the approximate vertebral segment and diagnosis of scoliosis on chest radiograph. The results suggest that this method might be a promising alternative strategy for scoliosis screening on chest radiograph and worth further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Visualization techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) are currently used for intubation device. By providing airway visualization during tracheal intubation, the technologies provide safe and accurate access to the trachea. The ability of AI to automatically identify airways from images of intubation device makes it attractive for use in intubation devices. The purpose of this review is to introduce the state of application of visualization techniques and AI in certain intubation devices. We reviewed the evidence of clinical implications of the use of video-assisted intubation device in the intubation time, first attempt success rate, and intubation of the difficult airway. Especially, VivaSight single-lumen tube with an incorporated optics allows direct viewing of the airway. VivaSight single-lumen tube has more advantages in tracheal intubation. AI has been applied to fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) and video laryngoscope with automatic airway image recognition, and has achieved certain accomplishment. Further, we discussed the possibility of applying AI to the VivaSight single-lumen tube and proposed future directions of research and application.",
