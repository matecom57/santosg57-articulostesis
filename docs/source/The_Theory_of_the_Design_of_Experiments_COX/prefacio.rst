Preface

This book is an account of the major topics in the design of
experiments, with particular emphasis on the key concepts involved
and on the statistical structure associated with these concepts.
While design of experiments is in many ways a very well developed
area of statistics, it often receives less emphasis than methods of
analysis in a programme of study in statistics.

We have written for a general audience concerned with statistics
in experimental fields and with some knowledge of and interest in
theoretical issues. The mathematical level is mostly elementary;
occasional passages using more advanced ideas can be skipped or
omitted without inhibiting understanding of later passages. Some
specialized parts of the subject have extensive and specialized literatures, a few examples being incomplete block designs, mixture
designs, designs for large variety trials, designs based on spatial
stochastic models and designs constructed from explicit optimality
requirements. We have aimed to give relatively brief introductions
to these subjects eschewing technical detail.

To motivate the discussion we give outline Illustrations taken
from a range of areas of application. In addition we give a limited
number of Examples, mostly taken from the literature, used for the
different purpose of showing detailed methods of analysis without
much emphasis on specific subject-matter interpretation.

We have written a book about design not about analysis, although, as has often been pointed out, the two phases are inex-
orably interrelated. Therefore it is, in particular, not a book on
the linear statistical model or that related but distinct art form
the analysis of variance table. Nevertheless these topics enter and
there is a dilemma in presentation. What do we assume the reader
knows about these matters? We have solved this problem uneasily
by somewhat downplaying analysis in the text, by assuming whatever is necessary for the section in question and by giving a review
as an Appendix. Anyone using the book as a basis for a course of
lectures will need to consider carefully what the prospective students are likely to understand about the linear model and to sup-
plement the text appropriately. While the arrangement of chapters
represents a logical progression of ideas, if interest is focused on a
particular field of application it will be reasonable to omit certain
parts or to take the material in a different order.

If defence of a book on the theory of the subject is needed it is
this. Successful application of these ideas hinges on adapting general principles to the special constraints of individual applications.
Thus experience suggests that while it is useful to know about special designs, balanced incomplete block designs for instance, it is
rather rare that they can be used directly. More commonly they
need some adaptation to accommodate special circumstances and
to do this effectively demands a solid theoretical base.

This book has been developed from lectures given at Cambridge,
Birkbeck College London, Vancouver, Toronto and Oxford. We are
grateful to Amy Berrington, Mario Cortina Borja, Christl Donnelly, Peter Kupchak, Rahul Mukerjee, John Nelder, Rob Tibshi-
rani and especially Grace Yun Yi for helpful comments on a preliminary version.
