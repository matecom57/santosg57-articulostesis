    "abstract": "Implementation of behavior therapy for ADHD faces challenges in community settings. We describe development of a community-based implementation model for adolescent ADHD behavior therapy (Supporting Teens' Autonomy Daily; STAND) blended with Motivational Interviewing (MI). A stakeholder-engaged development approach is used based on the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework. Resulting model features include: (a) task-shifting supervision from experts to agency supervisors, (b) holding bi-weekly technical assistance drop-ins to provide training and implementation supports, (c) MI integrity monitoring and feedback by artificial intelligence (AI), (d) AI-generated metrics for STAND content fidelity, (e) digitizing resources (manual, worksheets, tips, videos) on a clinician dashboard, (f) creating visual displays of feedback using badges and graphs, and (g) adding a rapport-building session prior to manualized content. We conducted stakeholder focus groups (",

    "abstract": "Human oversight has become a key mechanism for the governance of artificial intelligence (\"AI\"). Human overseers are supposed to increase the accuracy and safety of AI systems, uphold human values, and build trust in the technology. Empirical research suggests, however, that humans are not reliable in fulfilling their oversight tasks. They may be lacking in competence or be harmfully incentivised. This creates a challenge for human oversight to be effective. In addressing this challenge, this article aims to make three contributions. First, it surveys the emerging laws of oversight, most importantly the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (\"AIA\"). It will be shown that while the AIA is concerned with the competence of human overseers, it does not provide much guidance on how to achieve effective oversight and leaves oversight obligations for AI developers underdefined. Second, this article presents a novel taxonomy of human oversight roles, differentiated along whether human intervention is constitutive to, or corrective of a decision made or supported by an AI. The taxonomy allows to propose suggestions for improving effectiveness tailored to the type of oversight in question. Third, drawing on scholarship within democratic theory, this article formulates six normative principles which institutionalise distrust in human oversight of AI. The institutionalisation of distrust has historically been practised in democratic governance. Applied for the first time to AI governance, the principles anticipate the fallibility of human overseers and seek to mitigate them at the level of institutional design. They aim to directly increase the trustworthiness of human oversight and to indirectly inspire well-placed trust in AI governance.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to utilize a no-code computer vision platform to develop, train, and evaluate a model specifically designed for segmenting dental restorations on panoramic radiographs.\nOne hundred anonymized panoramic radiographs were selected for this study. Accurate labeling of dental restorations was performed by calibrated dental faculty and students, with subsequent final review by an oral radiologist. The radiographs were automatically split within the platform into training (70%), development (20%), and testing (10%) subgroups. The model was trained for 40 epochs using a medium model size. Data augmentation techniques available within the platform, namely horizontal and vertical flip, were utilized on the training set to improve the model's predictions. Post-training, the model was tested for independent predictions. The model's diagnostic validity was assessed through the calculation of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1-score by pixel and by tooth, and by ROC-AUC.\nA total of 1,108 restorations were labeled on 960 teeth. At a confidence threshold of 0.95, the model achieved 86.64% sensitivity, 99.78% specificity, 99.63% accuracy, 82.4% precision and an F1-score of 0.844 by pixel. The model achieved 98.34% sensitivity, 98.13% specificity, 98.21% accuracy, 98.85% precision and an F1-score of 0.98 by tooth. ROC curve showed high performance with an AUC of 0.978.\nThe no-code computer vision platform used in this study accurately detected dental restorations on panoramic radiographs. However, further research and validation are required to evaluate the performance of no-code platforms on larger and more diverse datasets, as well as for other detection and segmentation tasks.\nThe advent of no-code computer vision holds significant promise in dentistry and dental research by eliminating the requirement for coding skills, democratizing access to artificial intelligence tools, and potentially revolutionizing dental diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated in healthcare, it is incumbent on healthcare professional associations (HPAs) to assist their memberships in preparing for related change. HPAs hold a unique role in establishing the socio-cultural, normative, and regulative elements of healthcare professions. An exploratory multiple-case study approach was employed to consider how, when faced with AI as a disruptive technology, HPAs engage in sense-making and legitimation of the change in order to support their membership in preparing for future practice. The Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologists, Canadian Association of Radiation Oncology, Canadian Association of Radiologists, and Canadian Organization of Medical Physicists were selected as cases. Data collection involved key-informant interviews and document review, anticipated impact of AI on care and practice, reflections on perceptions of the professional membership and the role and actions of the HPA in influencing such perceptions and work. Concept coding allowed for inductive framing of individual case narratives and subsequent cross-case analysis. Eighteen interviews were conducted and documents spanning 2013 to 2020 were reviewed. Eleven coding categories and 25 subconcepts were identified, spanning perceived impact of AI, perspectives on prevalent mindsets, roles of HPAs in preparing their membership, including changing education needs. The HPAs studied engaged in work to support AI consideration in varying ways, with perceived roles in education, advocacy, and leadership. Emergent trends across the four HPAs suggested three factors that might influence engagement; factors related to the organization, those related to the profession, and those related to the innovation in question. All HPAs acknowledged AI's impact on practice in medical imaging and radiation medicine, while some saw it as more of a disruptive force and assigned it greater priority in the organizations. Conceptualizations of the potential threat to the profession and the HPA's role in supporting members in navigating that future landscape were also key insights. This research suggests how healthcare professions are engaging at the macro level in the implementation and normalization work related to AI, and sheds light on nuanced perspectives on AI of groups that would interface with it.",

    "abstract": "ScanNav\nNineteen experts in ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia (UGRA) annotated 100 structures in 30 ultrasound videos across six anatomical regions. These annotations were compared with each other to produce a quantitative assessment of the level of agreement amongst human experts. The AI colour overlay was then compared with all expert annotations. Differences in human-human and human-AI agreement are presented for each structure class (artery, muscle, nerve, fascia/serosal plane) and structure. Clinical context is provided through subjective assessment data from UGRA experts.\nFor human-human and human-AI annotations, agreement was highest for arteries (mean Dice score 0.88/0.86), then muscles (0.80/0.77), and lowest for nerves (0.48/0.41). Wide discrepancy exists in consistency for different structures, both with human-human and human-AI comparisons; highest for sartorius muscle (0.91/0.92) and lowest for the radial nerve (0.21/0.27).\nHuman experts and the AI system both showed the same pattern of agreement in sono-anatomical structure identification. The clinical significance of the differences presented must be explored; however the perception that human expert opinion is uniform must be challenged. Elements of this assessment framework could be used for other devices to allow consistent evaluations that inform clinical training and practice. Anaesthetists should be actively engaged in the development and adoption of new AI technology.",

However, due to the dynamic nature of RNA molecules, RNA structures are difficult to determine experimentally or predict computationally. Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized many biomedical fields and has been progressively utilized to deduce RNA structures, target binding, and associated functionality. Integrating structural and target binding information could also help improve the robustness of AI-based RNA function prediction and RNA design.

    "abstract": "The arrival of COVID-19 in Brazil had a marked impact on the health network as well as on the professionals involved, due to the significant number of cases and constantly updated information. In this context, the Cooperative Intelligence Platform for Primary Health Care - Picaps - is set up as a technological platform that assists by systematizing the communication and negotiation processes among actors, with a focus on science and technology. This article sets out to describe the processes of Picaps, which consist of a collaborative system conceived of as a public solution capable of generating innovations in the areas of Science, Technology and Health, in order to tackle COVID-19 in territories with populations in socially vulnerable situations in the Federal District (DF). It integrates data collection and processing, as well as the dissemination of information for its use, both at the governmental and societal levels. Picaps can be seen as a powerful government instrument to help societies across the country, especially those in vulnerable situations, capable of assisting in the use of cooperative intelligence in primary care and health surveillance actions to build innovative solutions such as rapid responses to face health crises in modern times.\nA chegada da COVID-19 ao Brasil gerou grande impacto no sistema de sa\u00fade, bem como em seus profissionais, com o elevado n\u00famero de casos e informa\u00e7\u00f5es constantemente publicadas. Nesse contexto, criou-se a Plataforma de Intelig\u00eancia Cooperativa para a Aten\u00e7\u00e3o Prim\u00e1ria \u00e0 Sa\u00fade (Picaps), uma plataforma tecnol\u00f3gica que ajuda a sistematizar os processos de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o e negocia\u00e7\u00e3o de atores, tendo como foco a ci\u00eancia e a tecnologia. O presente trabalho tem como objetivo descrever os processos da Picaps, sendo esta constitu\u00edda por um sistema colaborativo concebido como solu\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00fablica capaz de gerar inova\u00e7\u00f5es nas \u00e1reas de ci\u00eancia, tecnologia e sa\u00fade para o enfrentamento da COVID-19 no Distrito Federal (DF). Nela integram-se processos de coleta e tratamento de dados, al\u00e9m da dissemina\u00e7\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00f5es visando o seu uso tanto em n\u00edvel governamental quanto em n\u00edvel societal. A Picaps pode ser vista como um poderoso instrumento governamental para auxiliar sociedades espalhadas pelo pa\u00eds, sobretudo as que se encontram em situa\u00e7\u00e3o de vulnerabilidade, com capacidade de nortear o uso da intelig\u00eancia cooperativa em a\u00e7\u00f5es de aten\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria e vigil\u00e2ncia em sa\u00fade para constru\u00e7\u00e3o de solu\u00e7\u00f5es inovadoras como respostas r\u00e1pidas para o enfrentamento de crises sanit\u00e1rias em tempos contempor\u00e2neos.",

    "abstract": "Handwashing is a vital skill for maintaining health and hygiene. For individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), such as autism spectrum disorder, evidence-based strategies, such as prompting and task analysis, may be effective in teaching these skills. Due to the shortage of experts who teach individuals with IDD skills such as handwashing, staff working with children need a means of ensuring these instructional strategies are implemented with fidelity. This study examined the effects of a tablet-based application that used artificial intelligence (GAINS\u00ae) on four behavior technicians' implementation of least-to-most prompting, total task chaining, and time delay during an acquisition of handwashing program with young children with autism. All four technicians increased fidelity immediately upon using GAINS and all four technicians reached mastery criteria within the shortest number of sessions possible. One child participant met mastery criteria, two showed some gains, and one demonstrated a high degree of variability across sessions. Limitations of the least-to-most prompting procedure, user design, considerations and directions for future research and practice are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate among all cancers in the world. Hence, early diagnosis and personalized treatment plans are crucial to improving its 5-year survival rate. Chest computed tomography (CT) serves as an essential tool for lung cancer screening, and pathology images are the gold standard for lung cancer diagnosis. However, medical image evaluation relies on manual labor and suffers from missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis, and physician heterogeneity. The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought a whole novel opportunity for medical task processing, demonstrating the potential for clinical application in lung cancer diagnosis and treatment. AI technologies, including machine learning and deep learning, have been deployed extensively for lung nodule detection, benign and malignant classification, and subtype identification based on CT images. Furthermore, AI plays a role in the non-invasive prediction of genetic mutations and molecular status to provide the optimal treatment regimen, and applies to the assessment of therapeutic efficacy and prognosis of lung cancer patients, enabling precision medicine to become a reality. Meanwhile, histology-based AI models assist pathologists in typing, molecular characterization, and prognosis prediction to enhance the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment. However, the leap to extensive clinical application still faces various challenges, such as data sharing, standardized label acquisition, clinical application regulation, and multimodal integration. Nevertheless, AI holds promising potential in the field of lung cancer to improve cancer care.",

    "abstract": "Chat generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT) is a conversational language model powered by artificial intelligence (AI). It is a sophisticated language model that employs deep learning methods to generate human-like text outputs to inputs in the natural language. This narrative review aims to shed light on ethical concerns about using AI models like ChatGPT in writing assistance in the health care and medical domains. Currently, all the AI models like ChatGPT are in the infancy stage; there is a risk of inaccuracy of the generated content, lack of contextual understanding, dynamic knowledge gaps, limited discernment, lack of responsibility and accountability, issues of privacy, data security, transparency, and bias, lack of nuance, and originality. Other issues such as authorship, unintentional plagiarism, falsified and fabricated content, and the threat of being red-flagged as AI-generated content highlight the need for regulatory compliance, transparency, and disclosure. If the legitimate issues are proactively considered and addressed, the potential applications of AI models as writing assistance could be rewarding.",

    "abstract": "For centuries, the brain has been considered a single organ from an anatomical and functional perspective. However, while the cerebral cortex, consisting of many lobes and lobules, generally creates voluntary actions, autonomous parts of the brain also carry out vital activities such as survival, reproduction, and nutrition. The functions of the group of organs that carry out basic vital activities are modulated by autonomous ganglia that work like the deep intelligence networks of the brain. Information and energy packets produced as different molecules in vital organs and sent to the autonomous ganglia are decoded. These packages are then made available for use by cells, tissues, and organs. This deep information, purified and summarized by the autonomic ganglia, is presented to the cerebral cortex after passing through the control of the brainstem and insula. As a result, the entire brain and all the organs under its control decide together what to do. From this conceptual perspective, the brain is a united states group with diferent states under its management; the autonomic ganglia can also be thought of as the brain's deep intelligence networks.",

    "abstract": "The aging population challenges the health-care system with chronic diseases. Cerebrovascular diseases are important components of these chronic conditions. Stroke is the acute cessation of blood in the brain, which can lead to rapid tissue loss. Therefore, fast, accurate, and reliable automatic methods are required to facilitate stroke management. The performance of artificial intelligence (AI) methods is increasing in all domains. Vision tasks, including natural images and medical images, are particularly benefiting from the skills of AI models. The AI methods that can be applied to stroke imaging have a broad range, including classical machine learning tools such as support vector machines, random forests, logistic regression, and linear discriminant analysis, as well as deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, autoencoders, and U-Net. Both tools can be applied to various aspects of stroke management, including time-to-event onset determination, stroke confirmation, large vessel occlusion detection, difusion restriction, perfusion deficit, core and penumbra identification, afected region segmentation, and functional outcome prediction. While building these AI models, maximum care should be exercised in order to reduce bias and build generalizable models. One of the most important prerequisites for building unbiased models is collecting large, diverse, and quality data that reflects the underlying population well and splitting the training and testing parts in a way that both represent a similar distribution. Explainability and trustworthiness are other important properties of machine learning models that could be widely adopted in clinical practices.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the challenges of producing CAR-T cells for cancer treatment and the potential for Artificial Intelligence (AI) for its improvement. CAR-T cell therapy was approved in 2018 as the first Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) for treating acute leukemia and lymphoma. ATMPs are cell- and gene-based therapies that show great promise for treating various cancers and hereditary diseases. While some new ATMPs have been approved, ongoing clinical trials are expected to lead to the approval of many more. However, the production of CAR-T cells presents a significant challenge due to the high costs associated with the manufacturing process, making the therapy very expensive (approx. $400,000). Furthermore, autologous CAR-T therapy is limited to a make-to-order approach, which makes scaling economical production difficult. First attempts are being made to automate this multi-step manufacturing process, which will not only directly reduce the high manufacturing costs but will also enable comprehensive data collection. AI technologies have the ability to analyze this data and convert it into knowledge and insights. In order to exploit these opportunities, this paper analyses the data potential in the automated CAR-T production process and creates a mapping to the capabilities of AI applications. The paper explores the possible use of AI in analyzing the data generated during the automated process and its capabilities to further improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of CAR-T cell production.",

    "abstract": "Catheter ablation (CA) is considered as one of the most effective methods technique for eradicating persistent and abnormal cardiac arrhythmias. Nevertheless, in some cases, these arrhythmias are not treated properly, resulting in their recurrences. If left untreated, they may result in complications such as strokes, heart failure, or death. Until recently, the primary techniques for diagnosing recurrent arrhythmias following CA were the findings predisposing to the changes caused by the arrhythmias on cardiac imaging and electrocardiograms during follow-up visits, or if patients reported having palpitations or chest discomfort after the ablation. However, these follow-ups may be time-consuming and costly, and they may not always determine the root cause of the recurrences. With the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI), these follow-up visits can be effectively shortened, and improved methods for predicting the likelihood of recurring arrhythmias after their ablation procedures can be developed. AI can be divided into two categories: machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), the latter of which is a subset of ML. ML and DL models have been used in several studies to demonstrate their ability to predict and identify cardiac arrhythmias using clinical variables, electrophysiological characteristics, and trends extracted from imaging data. AI has proven to be a valuable aid for cardiologists due to its ability to compute massive amounts of data and detect subtle changes in electric signals and cardiac images, which may potentially increase the risk of recurrent arrhythmias after CA. Despite the fact that these studies involving AI have generated promising outcomes comparable to or superior to human intervention, they have primarily focused on atrial fibrillation while atrial flutter (AFL) and atrial tachycardia (AT) were the subjects of relatively few AI studies. Therefore, the aim of this review is to investigate the interaction of AI algorithms, electrophysiological characteristics, imaging data, risk score calculators, and clinical variables in predicting cardiac arrhythmias following an ablation procedure. This review will also discuss the implementation of these algorithms to enable the detection and prediction of AFL and AT recurrences following CA.",

    "abstract": "There is a strong association between emotional intelligence (EI) and academic performance in medical students.\nThis study aimed to explore the \u200f relationship between EI and academic performance among medical students at Tabuk University.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students in clinical years in the Faculty of Medicine, Tabuk University, Tabuk City, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Each study participant received a self-administered questionnaire composed of two parts: demographic data and the Schutte Self Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSEIT).\nThe present study included 203 of the clinical-phase medical students. The academic achievement level was not associated with the students' gender (p = 0.194) or academic level (p = 0.278). Female students had a significantly higher total SSEIT score than male students (p < 0.001). The sixth-year students had a significantly higher perception of emotion than the fourth-year students (p = 0.029). Students with excellent academic achievement had higher mean scores for managing others' emotions (p = 0.004) and utilization of emotion compared to those with fair and very good levels (p = 0.042).\nSome components of EI correlate with academic performance, gender, and academic level. Further research should be launched to assess the correlation between EI and academic performance among all medical students in all regions of KSA. Students can benefit by attending workshops and courses in universities to develop the students' EI because of its impact on their academic performance.",

The academic achievement level was not associated with the students' gender (p = 0.194) or academic level (p = 0.278). Female students had a significantly higher total SSEIT score than male students (p < 0.001). The sixth-year students had a significantly higher perception of emotion than the fourth-year students (p = 0.029). Students with excellent academic achievement had higher mean scores for managing others' emotions (p = 0.004) and utilization of emotion compared to those with fair and very good levels (p = 0.042).",

    "abstract": "The aim of this literature review is to yield a comprehensive and exhaustive overview of the existing evidence and up-to-date applications of artificial intelligence for knee osteoarthritis.\nA literature review was performed by using PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEE databases for articles published in peer-reviewed journals in 2022. The articles focusing on the use of artificial intelligence in diagnosis and prognosis of knee osteoarthritis and accelerating the image acquisition were selected. For each selected study, the code availability, considered number of patients and knees, imaging type, covariates, grading type of osteoarthritis, models, validation approaches, objectives, and results were reviewed.\n395 articles were screened, and 35 of them were reviewed. Eight articles were based on diagnosis, six on prognosis prediction, three on classification, three on accelerated image acquisition, and 15 on segmentation of knee osteoarthritis. 57% of the articles used MRI, 26% radiography, 6% MRI together with radiography, 6% ultrasonography, and 6% only clinical data. 23% of the articles made the computer codes available for their study, and 26% used clinical data. External validation and nested cross-validation were used in 17% and 14% of articles, respectively.\nThe use of artificial intelligence provided a promising potential to enhance the detection and management of knee osteoarthritis. Translating the developed models into clinics is still in the early stages of development. The translation of artificial intelligence models is expected to be further examined in prospective studies to support clinicians in improving routine healthcare practice.",

    "abstract": "Detection of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) involves integration of multiple imaging and clinical features which are often discordant or indeterminate.\nThe authors applied artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze a single apical 4-chamber transthoracic echocardiogram video clip to detect HFpEF.\nA 3-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed and trained on apical 4-chamber video clips to classify patients with HFpEF (diagnosis of heart failure, ejection fraction\u00a0\u226550%, and echocardiographic evidence of increased filling pressure; cases) vs without HFpEF (ejection fraction\u00a0\u226550%, no diagnosis of heart failure, normal filling pressure; controls). Model outputs were classified as HFpEF, no HFpEF, or nondiagnostic (high uncertainty). Performance was assessed in an independent multisite data set and compared to previously validated clinical scores.\nTraining and validation included 2,971 cases and 3,785 controls (validation holdout, 16.8% patients), and demonstrated excellent discrimination (area under receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.97 [95%\u00a0CI: 0.96-0.97] and 0.95 [95% CI: 0.93-0.96] in training and validation, respectively). In independent testing (646 cases, 638 controls), 94 (7.3%) were nondiagnostic; sensitivity (87.8%; 95% CI: 84.5%-90.9%) and specificity (81.9%; 95% CI: 78.2%-85.6%) were maintained in clinically relevant subgroups, with high repeatability and reproducibility. Of 701 and 776 indeterminate outputs from the Heart\u00a0Failure Association-Pretest Assessment, Echocardiographic and Natriuretic Peptide Score, Functional Testing (HFA-PEFF), and Final Etiology and Heavy, Hypertensive, Atrial Fibrillation, Pulmonary Hypertension, Elder, and Filling Pressure (H2FPEF) scores, the AI HFpEF model correctly reclassified 73.5% and 73.6%, respectively. During follow-up (median: 2.3 [IQR: 0.5-5.6] years), 444 (34.6%) patients died; mortality was higher in patients classified as HFpEF by AI (HR: 1.9 [95% CI: 1.5-2.4]).\nAn AI HFpEF model based on a single, routinely acquired echocardiographic video demonstrated excellent discrimination of patients with vs without HFpEF, more often than clinical scores, and identified patients with higher mortality.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has permeated into every aspect of medicine and promises to provide accurate diagnosis, better management decision and improved outcome for patients and healthcare system. However, ethical, social and legal issues need to be resolved for successful implementation of AI tools in clinical practice. In order to gain trust and acceptance, AI algorithms should offer maximum explainability and inclusiveness. Robust evidence of benefit to patients and healthcare services has to be provided to gain justification of using these tools. Doctor-patient relationship needs to be maintained in order to gain trust and acceptance of users. Autonomy of decisions and dignity of patients need to be preserved while using machine in healthcare. Responsibility and accountability in the use of AI in medicine should be deliberated and defined before mishaps and damage occur. A new role of healthcare providers will emerge with the advancement of technology and changes are inevitable. This manuscript is based on the Gordon Arthur Ransome Lecture 2022 entitled \"Artificial Intelligence in Medicine: Ethical, Social and Legal Perspective\". It represents the opinion of the orator.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there is a paucity of prior investigations and studies examining applications for artificial intelligence (AI) in upper-extremity (UE) surgical education. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the performance of a novel AI tool (ChatGPT) on UE questions on the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE). We aimed to compare the performance of ChatGPT to the examination performance of hand surgery residents.\nWe selected questions from the 2020-2022 OITEs that focused on both the hand and UE as well as the shoulder and elbow content domains. These questions were divided into two categories: those with text-only prompts (text-only questions) and those that included supplementary images or videos (media questions). Two authors (B.K.F. and G.S.M.) converted the accompanying media into text-based descriptions. Included questions were inputted into ChatGPT (version 3.5) to generate responses. Each OITE question was entered into ChatGPT three times: (1) open-ended response, which requested a free-text response; (2) multiple-choice responses without asking for justification; and (3) multiple-choice response with justification. We referred to the OITE scoring guide for each year in order to compare the percentage of correct AI responses to correct resident responses.\nA total of 102 UE OITE questions were included; 59 were text-only questions, and 43 were media-based. ChatGPT correctly answered 46 (45%) of 102 questions using the Multiple Choice No Justification prompt requirement (42% for text-based and 44% for media questions). Compared to ChatGPT, postgraduate year 1 orthopaedic residents achieved an average score of 51% correct. Postgraduate year 5 residents answered 76% of the same questions correctly.\nChatGPT answered fewer UE OITE questions correctly compared to hand surgery residents of all training levels.\nFurther development of novel AI tools may be necessary if this technology is going to have a role in UE education.",

    "abstract": "Nearly one-third of patients with diabetes are poorly controlled (hemoglobin A\nThis study aims to assess how clinicians and staff members would use a clinical decision support tool based on artificial intelligence (AI) and identify factors that affect adoption.\nThis was a mixed methods study that combined semistructured interviews and surveys to assess the perceived usefulness and ease of use, intent to use, and factors affecting tool adoption. We recruited clinicians and staff members from practices that manage diabetes. During the interviews, participants reviewed a sample electronic health record alert and were informed that the tool uses AI to identify those at high risk for poor control. Participants discussed how they would use the tool, whether it would contribute to care, and the factors affecting its implementation. In a survey, participants reported their demographics; rank-ordered factors influencing the adoption of the tool; and reported their perception of the tool's usefulness as well as their intent to use, ease of use, and organizational support for use. Qualitative data were analyzed using a thematic content analysis approach. We used descriptive statistics to report demographics and analyze the findings of the survey.\nIn total, 22 individuals participated in the study. Two-thirds (14/22, 63%) of respondents were physicians. Overall, 36% (8/22) of respondents worked in academic health centers, whereas 27% (6/22) of respondents worked in federally qualified health centers. The interviews identified several themes: this tool has the potential to be useful because it provides information that is not currently available and can make care more efficient and effective; clinicians and staff members were concerned about how the tool affects patient-oriented outcomes and clinical workflows; adoption of the tool is dependent on its validation, transparency, actionability, and design and could be increased with changes to the interface and usability; and implementation would require buy-in and need to be tailored to the demands and resources of clinics and communities. Survey findings supported these themes, as 77% (17/22) of participants somewhat, moderately, or strongly agreed that they would use the tool, whereas these figures were 82% (18/22) for usefulness, 82% (18/22) for ease of use, and 68% (15/22) for clinic support. The 2 highest ranked factors affecting adoption were whether the tool improves health and the accuracy of the tool.\nMost participants found the tool to be easy to use and useful, although they had concerns about alert fatigue, bias, and transparency. These data will be used to enhance the design of an AI tool.",

    "abstract": "The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the biomedical field has attracted increasing attention in recent decades. Studying how past AI technologies have found their way into medicine over time can help to predict which current (and future) AI technologies have the potential to be utilized in medicine in the coming years, thereby providing a helpful reference for future research directions.\nThe aim of this study was to predict the future trend of AI technologies used in different biomedical domains based on past trends of related technologies and biomedical domains.\nWe collected a large corpus of articles from the PubMed database pertaining to the intersection of AI and biomedicine. Initially, we attempted to use regression on the extracted keywords alone; however, we found that this approach did not provide sufficient information. Therefore, we propose a method called \"background-enhanced prediction\" to expand the knowledge utilized by the regression algorithm by incorporating both the keywords and their surrounding context. This method of data construction resulted in improved performance across the six regression models evaluated. Our findings were confirmed through experiments on recurrent prediction and forecasting.\nIn our analysis using background information for prediction, we found that a window size of 3 yielded the best results, outperforming the use of keywords alone. Furthermore, utilizing data only prior to 2017, our regression projections for the period of 2017-2021 exhibited a high coefficient of determination (R\nIn this study, we explored AI trends in the biomedical field and developed a predictive model to forecast future trends.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based cancer detectors (CAD) for mammography are starting to be used for breast cancer screening in radiology departments. It is important to understand how AI CAD systems react to benign lesions, especially those that have been subjected to biopsy.\nOur goal was to corroborate the hypothesis that women with previous benign biopsy and cytology assessments would subsequently present increased AI CAD abnormality scores even though they remained healthy.\nThis is a retrospective study applying a commercial AI CAD system (Insight MMG, version 1.1.4.3; Lunit Inc) to a cancer-enriched mammography screening data set of 10,889 women (median age 56, range 40-74 years). The AI CAD generated a continuous prediction score for tumor suspicion between 0.00 and 1.00, where 1.00 represented the highest level of suspicion. A binary read (flagged or not flagged) was defined on the basis of a predetermined cutoff threshold (0.40). The flagged median and proportion of AI scores were calculated for women who were healthy, those who had a benign biopsy finding, and those who were diagnosed with breast cancer. For women with a benign biopsy finding, the interval between mammography and the biopsy was used for stratification of AI scores. The effect of increasing age was examined using subgroup analysis and regression modeling.\nOf a total of 10,889 women, 234 had a benign biopsy finding before or after screening. The proportions of flagged healthy women were 3.5%, 11%, and 84% for healthy women without a benign biopsy finding, those with a benign biopsy finding, and women with breast cancer, respectively (P<.001). For the 8307 women with complete information, radiologist 1, radiologist 2, and the AI CAD system flagged 8.5%, 6.8%, and 8.5% of examinations of women who had a prior benign biopsy finding. The AI score correlated only with increasing age of the women in the cancer group (P=.01).\nCompared to healthy women without a biopsy, the examined AI CAD system flagged a much larger proportion of women who had or would have a benign biopsy finding based on a radiologist's decision. However, the flagging rate was not higher than that for radiologists. Further research should be focused on training the AI CAD system taking prior biopsy information into account.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of allergic rhinitis (AR) primarily relies on symptoms and laboratory examinations. Due to limitations in outpatient settings, certain tests such as nasal provocation tests and nasal secretion smear examinations are not routinely conducted. Although there are clear diagnostic criteria, an accurate diagnosis still requires the expertise of an experienced doctor, considering the patient's medical history and conducting examinations. However, differences in physician knowledge and limitations of examination methods can result in variations in diagnosis.\nArtificial intelligence is a significant outcome of the rapid advancement in computer technology today. This study aims to present an intelligent diagnosis and detection method based on ensemble learning for AR.\nWe conducted a study on AR cases and 7 other diseases exhibiting similar symptoms, including rhinosinusitis, chronic rhinitis, upper respiratory tract infection, etc. Clinical data, encompassing medical history, clinical symptoms, allergen detection, and imaging, was collected. To develop an effective classifier, multiple models were employed to train on the same batch of data. By utilizing ensemble learning algorithms, we obtained the final ensemble classifier known as adaptive random forest-out of bag-easy ensemble (ARF-OOBEE). In order to perform comparative experiments, we selected 5 commonly used machine learning classification algorithms: Naive Bayes, support vector machine, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, deep forest (GC Forest), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost).To evaluate the prediction performance of AR samples, various parameters such as precision, sensitivity, specificity, G-mean, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve were jointly employed as evaluation indicators.\nWe compared 7 classification models, including probability models, tree models, linear models, ensemble models, and neural network models. The ensemble classification algorithms, namely ARF-OOBEE and GC Forest, outperformed the other algorithms in terms of the comprehensive classification evaluation index. The accuracy of G-mean and AUC parameters improved by nearly 2% when compared to the other algorithms. Moreover, these ensemble classifiers exhibited excellent performance in handling large-scale data and unbalanced samples.\nThe ARF-OOBEE ensemble learning model demonstrates strong generalization performance and comprehensive classification abilities, making it suitable for effective application in auxiliary AR diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy (DR) are the leading causes of irreversible retinal damage leading to blindness. Early detection of these diseases through regular screening is especially important to prevent progression. Retinal fundus imaging serves as the principal method for diagnosing glaucoma and DR. Consequently, automated detection of eye diseases represents a significant application of retinal image analysis. Compared with classical diagnostic techniques, image classification by convolutional neural networks (CNN) exhibits potential for effective eye disease detection.\nThis paper proposes the use of MATLAB - retrained AlexNet CNN for computerized eye diseases identification, particularly glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, by employing retinal fundus images. The acquisition of the database was carried out through free access databases and access upon request. A transfer learning technique was employed to retrain the AlexNet CNN for non-disease (Non_D), glaucoma (Sus_G) and diabetic retinopathy (Sus_R) classification. Moreover, model benchmarking was conducted using ResNet50 and GoogLeNet architectures. A Grad-CAM analysis is also incorporated for each eye condition examined.\nMetrics for validation accuracy, false positives, false negatives, precision, and recall were reported. Validation accuracies for the NetTransfer (I-V) and netAlexNet ranged from 89.7% to 94.3%, demonstrating varied effectiveness in identifying Non_D, Sus_G, and Sus_R categories, with netAlexNet achieving a 93.2% accuracy in the benchmarking of models against netResNet50 at 93.8% and netGoogLeNet at 90.4%.\nThis study demonstrates the efficacy of using a MATLAB-retrained AlexNet CNN for detecting glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. It emphasizes the need for automated early detection tools, proposing CNNs as accessible solutions without replacing existing technologies.",

    "abstract": "Medical artificial intelligence (AI) has tremendous potential to advance healthcare by supporting and contributing to the evidence-based practice of medicine, personalizing patient treatment, reducing costs, and improving both healthcare provider and patient experience. Unlocking this potential requires systematic, quantitative evaluation of the performance of medical AI models on large-scale, heterogeneous data capturing diverse patient populations. Here, to meet this need, we introduce MedPerf, an open platform for benchmarking AI models in the medical domain. MedPerf focuses on enabling federated evaluation of AI models, by securely distributing them to different facilities, such as healthcare organizations. This process of bringing the model to the data empowers each facility to assess and verify the performance of AI models in an efficient and human-supervised process, while prioritizing privacy. We describe the current challenges healthcare and AI communities face, the need for an open platform, the design philosophy of MedPerf, its current implementation status and real-world deployment, our roadmap and, importantly, the use of MedPerf with multiple international institutions within cloud-based technology and on-premises scenarios. Finally, we welcome new contributions by researchers and organizations to further strengthen MedPerf as an open benchmarking platform.",

Some examples related to lung pathology include acid-fast stain evaluation, programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) interpretation, evaluating histologic patterns of non-small-cell lung carcinoma, evaluating histologic features in mesothelioma associated with adverse outcomes, predicting response to anti-PDL-1 therapy from hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, evaluation of tumor microenvironment, evaluating patterns of interstitial lung disease, nondestructive methods for tissue evaluation, and others. There are still some frameworks (regulatory, workflow, and payment) that need to be established for these tools to be integrated into pathology.",

    "abstract": "Decision Support Systems (DSS) are tools designed to help operators make effective choices in workplace environments where discernment and critical thinking are required for effective performance. Path planning in military operations and general logistics both require individuals to make complex and time-sensitive decisions. However, these decisions can be complex and involve the synthesis of numerous tradeoffs for various paths with dynamically changing conditions. Intelligence collection can vary in difficulty, specifically in terms of the disparity between locations of interest and timing restrictions for when and how information can be collected. Furthermore, plans may need to be changed adaptively mid-operation, as new collection requirements appear, increasing task difficulty. We tested participants in a path planning decision-making exercise with scenarios of varying difficulty in a series of two experiments. In the first experiment, each map displayed two paths simultaneously, relating to two possible routes for the two available trucks. Participants selected the optimal path plan, representing the best solution across multiple routes. In the second experiment, each map displayed a single path, and participants selected the best two paths sequentially. In the first experiment, utilizing the DSS was predictive of adoption of more heuristic decision strategies, and that strategic approach yielded more optimal route selection. In the second experiment, there was a direct effect of the DSS on increased decision performance and a decrease in perceived task workload.",

    "abstract": "We have previously applied artificial intelligence (AI) to an electrocardiogram (ECG) to detect cardiac amyloidosis (CA).\nIn this validation study, the authors observe the postdevelopment performance of the AI-enhanced ECG to detect CA with respect to multiple potential confounders.\nAmyloid patients diagnosed after algorithm development (June 2019-January 2022) with a 12-lead ECG were identified (n = 440) and were required to have CA. A 15:1 age- and sex-matched control group was identified (n = 6,600). Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) was determined for the cohort and subgroups.\nThe average age was 70.4 \u00b1 10.3 years, 25.0% were female, and most patients were White (91.3%). In this validation, the AI-ECG for amyloidosis had an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82-0.86) for the overall cohort and between amyloid subtypes, which is a slight decrease from the original study (AUC 0.91). White, Black, and patients of \"other\" races had similar algorithm performance (AUC >0.81) with a decreased performance for Hispanic patients (AUC 0.66). Algorithm performance shift over time was not observed. Low ECG voltage and infarct pattern exhibited high AUC (>0.90), while left ventricular hypertrophy and left bundle branch block demonstrated lesser performance (AUC 0.75 and 0.76, respectively).\nThe AI-ECG for the detection of CA maintained an overall strong performance with respect to patient age, sex, race, and amyloid subtype. Lower performance was noted in left bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, and ethnically diverse populations emphasizing the need for subgroup-specific validation efforts.",

    "abstract": "Clinical decision support (CDS) systems (CDSSs) that integrate clinical guidelines need to reflect real-world co-morbidity. In patient-specific clinical contexts, transparent recommendations that allow for contraindications and other conflicts arising from co-morbidity are a requirement. In this work, we develop and evaluate a non-proprietary, standards-based approach to the deployment of computable guidelines with explainable argumentation, integrated with a commercial electronic health record (EHR) system in Serbia, a middle-income country in West Balkans.\nWe used an ontological framework, the Transition-based Medical Recommendation (TMR) model, to represent, and reason about, guideline concepts, and chose the 2017 International global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) guideline and a Serbian hospital as the deployment and evaluation site, respectively. To mitigate potential guideline conflicts, we used a TMR-based implementation of the Assumptions-Based Argumentation framework extended with preferences and Goals (ABA+G). Remote EHR integration of computable guidelines was via a microservice architecture based on HL7 FHIR and CDS Hooks. A prototype integration was developed to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with comorbid cardiovascular or chronic kidney diseases, and a mixed-methods evaluation was conducted with 20 simulated cases and five pulmonologists.\nPulmonologists agreed 97% of the time with the GOLD-based COPD symptom severity assessment assigned to each patient by the CDSS, and 98% of the time with one of the proposed COPD care plans. Comments were favourable on the principles of explainable argumentation; inclusion of additional co-morbidities was suggested in the future along with customisation of the level of explanation with expertise.\nAn ontological model provided a flexible means of providing argumentation and explainable artificial intelligence for a long-term condition. Extension to other guidelines and multiple co-morbidities is needed to test the approach further.",

Labeling includes tooth numbering (including teeth present and missing) and annotation of dental conditions (e.g., caries, dental restoration, residual root, endodontic treatment, implant, fixed prosthesis, incisal wear). The annotation process was performed in a Picture Archive and Communication System software customized for the study purposes using a small bounding box to delimit the entire tooth and items for radiographic diagnosis and a large bounding box to simultaneously delimit the 2 dental arches (maxilla and mandible). A JSON file was generated for each annotation.\nThe database encompassed 23,619 annotations; disagreement between radiologists occurred in 0.7% of the notes.\nThis work aimed to inform researchers about the importance of the labeling process, in addition to providing the scientific community with a bank of labeled images to implement artificial intelligence systems in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The main contribution of this article is establishing a set of behaviors and successful actions experimenting the Ipacs' (Institutional & Public Coaching Services) methodology on implementation of the National Recovery Plan (NRP), approved in Italy in 2021 to overcome the socio-economic impact of the pandemic. This research is aimed at pointing out emotional intelligence (EI) behaviors related to the activities of the NRP with respect to the National Health System (NHS).\nFifty-six professionals were provided with an integrated pathway with coaching, participative art and mentoring from January to June 2022. A \"core set\" of 5 soft skills - communication, result orientation, teamwork, networking, and emotional intelligence - was measured before and after an integrated coaching pathway. Each soft skill related to the following three systemic objectives through pre-defined, related activities: 1) defining and introducing new roles in the health community houses; 2) implementing a new systemic communication in oncology; 3) facilitating the management of chronicity through a new IT platform. We observed that the Giunti test (Org-EIQ) and Ipacs' test enlighten the same emotional intelligence indicators of behaviors considered by the investigated coaching integrated pathway.\nForty-eight percent of them increased in all 5 core skills. Results were measured at least in one of the two tests. These results were possible thanks to the changes in abilities of self- introspection, in communicating and sharing common goals, to achieve high standard results in conditions of uncertainty, to understand non-verbal feedback and give feedback.\nEmotional intelligence acted as a meta skill to pursue a \"new model of man\" with a new self-schema, self-image and set of behaviors.",

In this paper, we extensively study the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in delivering efficient responses to the COVID-19 pandemic almost four years after its start. In this regard, we examine a large number of critical studies conducted by various academic and research communities from multiple disciplines, as well as practical implementations of artificial intelligence algorithms that suggest potential solutions in investigating different COVID-19 decision-making scenarios. We identify numerous areas where artificial intelligence and machine learning can impact this context, including diagnosis (using chest X-ray imaging and CT imaging), severity, tracking, treatment, and the drug industry. Furthermore, we analyse the dilemma's limits, restrictions, and hazards.",

    "abstract": "To compare the diagnostic efficacy of AI-guided mpMRI-TRUS fusion assisted transperineal systematic biopsy, targeted biopsy and combined biopsy in the diagnosis of PCa, and to evaluate the clinical application value of combined biopsy.\nFrom April 2022, the general personal information and clinical data of patients with suspicious prostate lesions (PI-RADS\u22653) detected by 3.0T mpMRI were collected, then underwent AI-guided mpMRI-TRUS fusion-assisted transperineal prostate biopsy. The data included age, PSA level, PV, PSAD, PI-RADS score, Gleason score of biopsy tissue, etc. The mpMRI image data were imported into the real-time fusion imaging system before biopsy. After image fusion, the suspected PCa lesion was taken as the target, 2 to 3 cores of targeted biopsy were first performed, then 12 cores of systematic biopsy were continued. The results of targeted biopsy + systematic biopsy were defined as the results of combined biopsy. The detection rate of PCa, CsPCa and pathological Gleason score were compared among different biopsy methods, and the diagnostic efficacy in different PI-RADS score groups was further evaluated.\nA total of 118 PCa cases were detected in 220 patients enrolled in this study. The PCa detection rates of systematic biopsy and targeted biopsy were 40.45% and 43.64%, the result reveals no statistical significance (P=0.562). The PCa detection rate of combined biopsy was 53.64%, higher than single biopsy method and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). The detection rates of CsPCa in systematic biopsy and targeted biopsy were 28.18% and 37.27% which reveals significant statistical difference (P=0.042). The CsPCa detection rate of combined biopsy was 41.82%, higher than single biopsy method, the difference was statistically significant compared with systematic biopsy (P=0.003), but was not compared with targeted biopsy (P=0.330). In PI-RADS score 3 group, the PCa detection rate of systematic biopsy and targeted biopsy was 39.29% and 21.43%, which reveals no statistical significance (P=0.146). The PCa detection rate of combined biopsy was 50%, higher than single biopsy method, the difference was statistically significant compared with targeted biopsy (P=0.026), but was not compared with systematic biopsy (P=0.420). In PI-RADS 4 ~5 group, the PCa detection rate of systematic biopsy and targeted biopsy was 40.10%, and 46.88% which reveals no statistical significance (P=0.181). The PCa detection rate of combined biopsy was 54.17%, higher than single biopsy method, the difference was statistically significant compared with systematic biopsy (P=0.006), but was not compared with targeted biopsy (P=0.153). Among PCa patients detected by both systematic and targeted biopsy, 39 had concordant pathologic Gleason scores, 13 had escalating pathologic Gleason scores for systematic biopsy, and 18 had escalating pathologic Gleason scores for targeted biopsy.\nCompared with systematic biopsy, AI-guided mpMRI-TRUS image fusion assisted transperineal targeted prostate biopsy has a higher detection rate of CsPCa and is probably closer to the true pathological Gleason score. Compared with single biopsy, combined biopsy has higher diagnostic efficiency for PCa, which can be used as one of the options of prostate biopsy in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Recently, an artificial intelligence-based computer-assisted diagnosis (AI-CAD) for panoramic radiography was developed to scan the inferior margin of the mandible and automatically evaluate mandibular cortical morphology. The aim of this study was to analyze quantitatively the mandibular cortical morphology using the AI-CAD, especially focusing on underlying diseases and dental status in women over 20 years of age.\n419 patients in women over 20 years of age who underwent panoramic radiography were included in this study. The mandibular cortical morphology was analyzed with an AI-CAD that evaluated the degree of deformation of the mandibular inferior cortex (MIC) and mandibular cortical index (MCI) automatically. Those were analyzed in relation to underlying diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, rheumatism and osteoporosis, and dental status, such as the number of teeth present in the maxilla and mandible.\nThe degree of deformation of MIC in women under 51 years of age (21-50 years; n\u00a0=\u00a0229, 16.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.7) was significantly lower than those of over 50 years of age (51-90 years; n\u00a0=\u00a0190, 45.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.0), and the MCI was a significant difference for the different age group. Regarding the degree of deformation of MIC and MCI in women over 50 years of age, osteoporosis and number of total teeth present in the maxilla and mandible were significant differences.\nThe results of this study indicated that the mandibular cortical morphology using the AI-CAD is significantly related to osteoporosis and dental status in women over 50 years of age.",

    "abstract": "This essay examines how artificial intelligence (AI) technologies may shape international norms. Following a brief discussion of the ways in which AI technologies pose new governance questions, we reflect on the extent to which norm research in the discipline of International Relations (IR) is equipped to understand how AI technologies shape normative substance. Norm research has typically focused on the impact and failure of norms, offering increasingly diversified models of norm contestation, for instance. But present research has two shortcomings: a near-exclusive focus on modes and contexts of norm emergence and constitution that happen in the public space; and a focus on the workings of a pre-set normativity (ideas of oughtness and justice) that stands in an unclear relationship with normality (ideas of the standard, the average) emerging from practices. Responding to this, we put forward a research programme on AI and practical normativity/normality based on two pillars: first, we argue that operational practices of designing and using AI technologies typically performed outside of the public eye make norms; and second, we emphasise the interplay of normality and normativity as analytically influential in this process. With this, we also reflect on how increasingly relying on AI technologies across diverse policy domains has an under-examined effect on the exercise of human agency. This is important because the normality shaped by AI technologies can lead to forms of non-human generated normativity that risks replacing conventional models about how norms matter in AI-affected policy domains. We close with sketching three future research streams. We conclude that AI technologies are a major, yet still under-researched, challenge for understanding and studying norms. We should therefore reflect on new theoretical perspectives leading to insights that are also relevant for the struggle about top-down forms of AI regulation.\nThis essay critically discusses the interplay between artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and norms, focusing on the discipline of International Relations (IR). Here, norms are usually conceptualised as the products of reflection processes where actors debate and decide on \u201cagreeable\u201d standards. IR research on AI governance therefore turns towards international public and deliberative processes and their outcomes. But this risks missing two crucial pathways of how AI technologies may shape norms: first, how practices of designing and using AI technologies performed by actors at sites outside of the public eye make norms; and second, how design and use AI technologies may contribute to not only shaping normativity, in the sense of ideas of oughtness and justice, but also normality, in the sense of the average and the normal. We conclude that AI technologies pose an important challenge for research on norms and consequently require new conceptual and regulative perspectives.",

    "abstract": "The single largest contributor to human mortality is cardiovascular disease, the top risk factor for which is hypertension (HTN). The last two decades have placed much emphasis on the identification of genetic factors contributing to HTN. As a result, over 1,500 genetic alleles have been associated with human HTN. Mapping studies using genetic models of HTN have yielded hundreds of blood pressure (BP) loci but their individual effects on BP are minor, which limits opportunities to target them in the clinic. The value of collecting genome-wide association data is evident in ongoing research, which is beginning to utilize these data at individual-level genetic disparities combined with artificial intelligence (AI) strategies to develop a polygenic risk score (PRS) for the prediction of HTN. However, PRS alone may or may not be sufficient to account for the incidence and progression of HTN because genetics is responsible for <30% of the risk factors influencing the etiology of HTN pathogenesis. Therefore, integrating data from other nongenetic factors influencing BP regulation will be important to enhance the power of PRS. One such factor is the composition of gut microbiota, which constitute a more recently discovered important contributor to HTN. Studies to-date have clearly demonstrated that the transition from normal BP homeostasis to a state of elevated BP is linked to compositional changes in gut microbiota and its interaction with the host. Here, we first document evidence from studies on gut dysbiosis in animal models and patients with HTN followed by a discussion on the prospects of using microbiota data to develop a metagenomic risk score (MRS) for HTN to be combined with PRS and a clinical risk score (CRS). Finally, we propose that integrating AI to learn from the combined PRS, MRS and CRS may further enhance predictive power for the susceptibility and progression of HTN.",

    "abstract": "The sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship is deeply embedded in tradition - the Hippocratic oath, medical ethics, professional codes of conduct, and legislation - all of which are being disrupted by big data and 'artificial' intelligence (AI). The transition from paper-based records to electronic health records, wearables, mobile health applications and mobile phone data has created new opportunities to scale up data collection. Databases of unimaginable magnitude can be harnessed to develop algorithms for AI and to refine machine learning. Complex neural networks now lie at the core of ubiquitous AI systems in healthcare. A transformed healthcare environment enhanced by innovation, robotics, digital technology, and improved diagnostics and therapeutics is plagued by ethical, legal and social challenges. Global guidelines are emerging to ensure governance in AI, but many low- and middle-income countries have yet to develop context- specific frameworks. Legislation must be developed to frame liability and account for negligence due to robotics in the same way human healthcare providers are held accountable. The digital divide between high- and low-income settings is significant and has the potential to exacerbate health inequities globally.",

    "abstract": "OpenAI's Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) technology enables conversational interactions with applications across various fields, including sport. Here, ChatGPT's proficiency in designing a 12-week resistance training programme, following specific prompts, was investigated. GPT3.5 and GPT4.0 versions were requested to design 12-week resistance training programmes for male and female hypothetical subjects (20-years-old, no injury, and 'intermediate' resistance training experience). Subsequently, GPT4.0 was requested to design an 'advanced' training programme for the same profiles. The proposed training programmes were compared with established guidelines and literature (e.g., National Strength and Conditioning Association textbook), and discussed. ChatGPT suggested 12-week training programmes comprising three, 4-week phases, each with different objectives (e.g., hypertrophy/strength). GPT3.5 proposed a weekly frequency of ~3 sessions, load intensity of 70-85% of one repetition-maximum, repetition range of 4-8 (2-4 sets), and tempo of 2/0/2 (eccentric/pause/concentric/'pause'). GPT4.0 proposed intermediate- and advanced programme, with a frequency of 5 or 4 sessions, 60-90% or 70-95% intensity, 3-5 sets or 3-6 sets, 5-12 or 3-12 repetitions, respectively. GPT3.5 proposed rest intervals of 90-120 s, and exercise tempo of 2/0/2. GPT4.0 proposed 60-180 (intermediate) or 60-300 s (advanced), with exercise tempo of 2/1/2 for intermediates, and 3/0/1/0, 2/0/1/0, and 1/0/1/0 for advanced programmes. All derived programmes were objectively similar regardless of sex. ChatGPT generated training programmes which likely require additional fine-tuning before application. GPT4.0 synthesised more information than GPT3.5 in response to the prompt, and demonstrated recognition awareness of training experience (intermediate vs advanced). ChatGPT may serve as a complementary tool for writing 'draft' programme, but likely requires human expertise to maximise training programme effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare provides new possibilities for personalized health management. AI-based fitness applications are becoming more common, facilitating the opportunity for individualised exercise prescription. However, the use of AI carries the risk of inadequate expert supervision, and the efficacy and validity of such applications have not been thoroughly investigated, particularly in the context of diverse health conditions. The aim of the study was to critically assess the efficacy of exercise prescriptions generated by OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) model for five example patient profiles with diverse health conditions and fitness goals. Our focus was to assess the model's ability to generate exercise prescriptions based on a singular, initial interaction, akin to a typical user experience. The evaluation was conducted by leading experts in the field of exercise prescription. Five distinct scenarios were formulated, each representing a hypothetical individual with a specific health condition and fitness objective. Upon receiving details of each individual, the GPT-4 model was tasked with generating a 30-day exercise program. These AI-derived exercise programs were subsequently subjected to a thorough evaluation by experts in exercise prescription. The evaluation encompassed adherence to established principles of frequency, intensity, time, and exercise type; integration of perceived exertion levels; consideration for medication intake and the respective medical condition; and the extent of program individualization tailored to each hypothetical profile. The AI model could create general safety-conscious exercise programs for various scenarios. However, the AI-generated exercise prescriptions lacked precision in addressing individual health conditions and goals, often prioritizing excessive safety over the effectiveness of training. The AI-based approach aimed to ensure patient improvement through gradual increases in training load and intensity, but the model's potential to fine-tune its recommendations through ongoing interaction was not fully satisfying. AI technologies, in their current state, can serve as supplemental tools in exercise prescription, particularly in enhancing accessibility for individuals unable to access, often costly, professional advice. However, AI technologies are not yet recommended as a substitute for personalized, progressive, and health condition-specific prescriptions provided by healthcare and fitness professionals. Further research is needed to explore more interactive use of AI models and integration of real-time physiological feedback.",

A recent clinical trial investigating preimplantation DNA methylation screening (PIMS) revealed that whole genome DNA methylation level is a novel biomarker for assessing ART embryo quality. Here, we reinforced and estimated the clinical efficacy of PIMS. We introduce PIMS-AI, an innovative artificial intelligence (AI) based model, to predict the probability of an embryo producing live birth and subsequently assist ART embryo selection. Our model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 in cross-validation and 0.80 in independent testing. In simulated embryo selection, PIMS-AI attained an accuracy of 81% in identifying viable embryos for patients. Notably, PIMS-AI offers significant advantages over conventional preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A), including enhanced embryo discriminability and the potential to benefit a broader patient population. In conclusion, our approach holds substantial promise for clinical application and has the potential to significantly improve the ART success rate.",

    "abstract": "To investigate clinical factors associated with foveal avascular zone (FAZ) parameters obtained using OCT angiography (OCTA) with assistance from a previously developed artificial intelligence (AI) platform in eyes with open-angle glaucoma (OAG).\nRetrospective longitudinal.\nThis study followed up 885 eyes of 558 patients with OAG for \u2265 2 years; all eyes underwent\u00a0\u2265 5 Humphrey visual-field (VF) tests and had 3.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.0 mm macular OCTA scans available.\nAverage total deviation (TD) in the superior, superocentral, inferocentral, and inferior sectors of the Humphrey 24-2 program was calculated. We collected 3.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.0 mm macular OCTA images from each patient and used a previously developed AI platform with these images to obtain FAZ parameters, including FAZ area, FAZ circularity index (CI), and FAZ perimeter. Multivariable linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze the relationship between FAZ parameters, TD or TD slope in each quadrant, and systemic factors, adjusting for potential confounding factors, including axial length.\nOphthalmic and systemic variables, FAZ parameters, and TD or TD slope in each quadrant.\nThe multivariable model showed that FAZ parameters were correlated with both TD and TD slope in the inferocentral quadrant (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.244 - 0.168, \nArtificial intelligence-assisted OCTA-measured FAZ enlargement and irregular shape might be good markers of\u00a0ocular hypoperfusion and associated inferocentral VF defect progression in eyes with OAG.

ChatGPT may be able to augment the existing paradigm to work in conjunction with the clinical-teacher in PBL/CBL case generation. It can develop realistic patient cases that could be revised by clinical teachers to ensure accuracy and relevance. Further, it can be directed to include specific case content in order to facilitate the constructive alignment of the case with the broader learning objectives of the curriculum. There is also the possibility of improving engagement by 'gamifying' CBL/PBL.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40670-023-01934-5.",

    "abstract": "The diagnostic application of artificial intelligence (AI)-based models to detect cardiovascular diseases from electrocardiograms (ECGs) evolves, and promising results were reported. However, external validation is not available for all published algorithms. The aim of this study was to validate an existing algorithm for the detection of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) from 12-lead ECGs.\nPatients with digitalized data pairs of 12-lead ECGs and echocardiography (at intervals of \u22647 days) were retrospectively selected from the Heart Center Leipzig ECG and electronic medical records databases. A previously developed AI-based model was applied to ECGs and calculated probabilities for LVSD. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was computed overall and in cohorts stratified for baseline and ECG characteristics. Repeated echocardiography studies recorded \u22653 months after index diagnostics were used for follow-up (FU) analysis. At baseline, 42 291 ECG-echocardiography pairs were analysed, and AUROC for LVSD detection was 0.88. Sensitivity and specificity were 82% and 77% for the optimal LVSD probability cut-off based on Youden's J. AUROCs were lower in ECG subgroups with tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and wide QRS complexes. In patients without LVSD at baseline and available FU, model-generated high probability for LVSD was associated with a four-fold increased risk of developing LVSD during FU.\nWe provide the external validation of an existing AI-based ECG-analysing model for the detection of LVSD with robust performance metrics. The association of false positive LVSD screenings at baseline with a deterioration of ventricular function during FU deserves a further evaluation in prospective trials.",

    "abstract": "A majority of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) present without typical ST elevation. One-third of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients have an acutely occluded culprit coronary artery [occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI)], leading to poor outcomes due to delayed identification and invasive management. In this study, we sought to develop a versatile artificial intelligence (AI) model detecting acute OMI on single-standard 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and compare its performance with existing state-of-the-art diagnostic criteria.\nAn AI model was developed using 18 616 ECGs from 10 543 patients with suspected ACS from an international database with clinically validated outcomes. The model was evaluated in an international cohort and compared with STEMI criteria and ECG experts in detecting OMI. The primary outcome of OMI was an acutely occluded or flow-limiting culprit artery requiring emergent revascularization. In the overall test set of 3254 ECGs from 2222 patients (age 62 \u00b1 14 years, 67% males, 21.6% OMI), the AI model achieved an area under the curve of 0.938 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.924-0.951] in identifying the primary OMI outcome, with superior performance [accuracy 90.9% (95% CI: 89.7-92.0), sensitivity 80.6% (95% CI: 76.8-84.0), and specificity 93.7 (95% CI: 92.6-94.8)] compared with STEMI criteria [accuracy 83.6% (95% CI: 82.1-85.1), sensitivity 32.5% (95% CI: 28.4-36.6), and specificity 97.7% (95% CI: 97.0-98.3)] and with similar performance compared with ECG experts [accuracy 90.8% (95% CI: 89.5-91.9), sensitivity 73.0% (95% CI: 68.7-77.0), and specificity 95.7% (95% CI: 94.7-96.6)].\nThe present novel ECG AI model demonstrates superior accuracy to detect acute OMI when compared with STEMI criteria. This suggests its potential to improve ACS triage, ensuring appropriate and timely referral for immediate revascularization.",

    "abstract": "ECG abnormalities are often the first signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and we hypothesized that an artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced ECG could help identify patients with ARVC and serve as a valuable disease-detection tool.\nWe created a convolutional neural network to detect ARVC using a 12-lead ECG. All patients with ARVC who met the 2010 task force criteria and had disease-causative genetic variants were included. All case ECGs were randomly assigned in an 8:1:1 ratio into training, validation, and testing groups. The case ECGs were age- and sex-matched with control ECGs at our institution in a 1:100 ratio. Seventy-seven patients (51% male; mean age 47.2 \u00b1 19.9), including 56 patients with PKP2, 7 with DSG2, 6 with DSC2, 6 with DSP, and 2 with JUP were included. The model was trained using 61 case ECGs and 5009 control ECGs; validated with 7 case ECGs and 678 control ECGs and tested in 22 case ECGs and 1256 control ECGs. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the model were 77.3, 62.9, 3.32, and 99.4%, respectively. The area under the curve for rhythm ECG and median beat ECG was 0.75 and 0.76, respectively.\nOur study found that the model performed well in excluding ARVC and supports the concept that the AI ECG can serve as a biomarker for ARVC if a larger cohort were available for network training. A multicentre study including patients with ARVC from other centres would be the next step in refining, testing, and validating this algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Military AI optimists predict future AI assisting or making command decisions. We instead argue that, at a fundamental level, these predictions are dangerously wrong. The nature of war demands decisions based on abductive logic, whilst machine learning (or 'narrow AI') relies on inductive logic. The two forms of logic are not interchangeable, and therefore AI's limited utility in command - both tactical and strategic - is not something that can be solved by more data or more computing power. Many defence and government leaders are therefore proceeding with a false view of the nature of AI and of war itself.",

    "abstract": "Kidney disease is a serious public health problem and various kidney diseases could progress to end-stage renal disease. The many complications of end-stage renal disease. have a significant impact on the physical and mental health of patients. Ultrasound can be the test of choice for evaluating the kidney and perirenal tissue as it is real-time, available and non-radioactive. To overcome substantial interobserver variability in renal ultrasound interpretation, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to be a new method to help radiologists make clinical decisions. This review introduces the applications of AI in renal ultrasound, including automatic segmentation of the kidney, measurement of the renal volume, prediction of the kidney function, diagnosis of the kidney diseases. The advantages and disadvantages of the applications will also be presented clinicians to conduct research. Additionally, the challenges and future perspectives of AI are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Meticulous manual delineations of the prostate and the surrounding organs at risk are necessary for prostate cancer radiation therapy to avoid side effects to the latter. This process is time consuming and hampered by inter- and intraobserver variability, all of which could be alleviated by artificial intelligence (AI). This study aimed to evaluate the performance of AI compared with manual organ delineations on computed tomography (CT) scans for radiation treatment planning.\nManual delineations of the prostate, urinary bladder, and rectum of 1530 patients with prostate cancer who received curative radiation therapy from 2006 to 2018 were included. Approximately 50% of those CT scans were used as a training set, 25% as a validation set, and 25% as a test set. Patients with hip prostheses were excluded because of metal artifacts. After training and fine-tuning with the validation set, automated delineations of the prostate and organs at risk were obtained for the test set. S\u00f8rensen-Dice similarity coefficient, mean surface distance, and Hausdorff distance were used to evaluate the agreement between the manual and automated delineations.\nThe median S\u00f8rensen-Dice similarity coefficient between the manual and AI delineations was 0.82, 0.95, and 0.88 for the prostate, urinary bladder, and rectum, respectively. The median mean surface distance and Hausdorff distance were 1.7 and 9.2 mm for the prostate, 0.7 and 6.7 mm for the urinary bladder, and 1.1 and 13.5 mm for the rectum, respectively.\nAutomated CT-based organ delineation for prostate cancer radiation treatment planning is feasible and shows good agreement with manually performed contouring.",

    "abstract": "Recent systematic reviews of acute care medicine applications of artificial intelligence (AI) have focused on hospital and general prehospital uses. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify and describe the literature on AI use with a focus on applications in helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS).\nA literature search was performed with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles were grouped by characteristics such as publication year and general subject matter with categoric and temporal trend analyses.\nWe identified 21 records focused on the use of AI in HEMS. These applications included both clinical and triage uses and nonclinical uses. The earliest study appeared in 2006, but over one third of the identified studies have been published in 2021 or later. The passage of time has seen an increased likelihood of HEMS AI studies focusing on nonclinical issues; for each year, the likelihood of a nonclinical focus had an odds ratio of 1.3.\nThis scoping review provides overview and hypothesis-generating information regarding AI applications specific to HEMS. HEMS AI may be ultimately deployed in nonclinical arenas as much as or more than for clinical decision support. Future studies will inform future decisions as to how AI may improve HEMS systems design, asset deployment, and clinical care.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis is a prevalent and persistent chronic inflammatory skin disorder that poses significant challenges when it comes to accurately assessing its severity. The aim of this study was to evaluate deep learning models for automated atopic dermatitis severity scoring using a dataset of Aceh ethnicity individuals in Indonesia. The dataset of clinical images was collected from 250 patients at Dr. Zainoel Abidin Hospital, Banda Aceh, Indonesia and labeled by dermatologists as mild, moderate, severe, or none. Five pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN) architectures were evaluated: ResNet50, VGGNet19, MobileNetV3, MnasNet, and EfficientNetB0. The evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score, were employed to assess the models. Among the models, ResNet50 emerged as the most proficient, demonstrating an accuracy of 89.8%, precision of 90.00%, sensitivity of 89.80%, specificity of 96.60%, and an F1-score of 89.85%. These results highlight the potential of incorporating advanced, data-driven models into the field of dermatology. These models can serve as invaluable tools to assist dermatologists in making early and precise assessments of atopic dermatitis severity and therefore improve patient care and outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Resident training programs in the US use the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE) developed by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) to assess the current knowledge of their residents and to identify the residents at risk of failing the Amerian Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) examination. Optimal strategies for OITE preparation are constantly being explored. There may be a role for Large Language Models (LLMs) in orthopaedic resident education. ChatGPT, an LLM launched in late 2022 has demonstrated the ability to produce accurate, detailed answers, potentially enabling it to aid in medical education and clinical decision-making. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on Orthopaedic In-Training Examinations using Self-Assessment Exams from the AAOS database and approved literature as a proxy for the Orthopaedic Board Examination.\n301 SAE questions from the AAOS database and associated AAOS literature were input into ChatGPT's interface in a question and multiple-choice format and the answers were then analyzed to determine which answer choice was selected. A new chat was used for every question. All answers were recorded, categorized, and compared to the answer given by the OITE and SAE exams, noting whether the answer was right or wrong.\nOf the 301 questions asked, ChatGPT was able to correctly answer 183 (60.8%) of them. The subjects with the highest percentage of correct questions were basic science (81%), oncology (72.7%, shoulder and elbow (71.9%), and sports (71.4%). The questions were further subdivided into 3 groups: those about management, diagnosis, or knowledge recall. There were 86 management questions and 47 were correct (54.7%), 45 diagnosis questions with 32 correct (71.7%), and 168 knowledge recall questions with 102 correct (60.7%).\nChatGPT has the potential to provide orthopedic educators and trainees with accurate clinical conclusions for the majority of board-style questions, although its reasoning should be carefully analyzed for accuracy and clinical validity. As such, its usefulness in a clinical educational context is currently limited but rapidly evolving.\nChatGPT can access a multitude of medical data and may help provide accurate answers to clinical questions.",

    "abstract": "Dementia poses a growing challenge for health services but remains stigmatized and under-recognized. Digital technologies to aid the earlier detection of dementia are approaching market. These include traditional cognitive screening tools presented on mobile devices, smartphone native applications, passive data collection from wearable, in-home and in-car sensors, as well as machine learning techniques applied to clinic and imaging data. It has been suggested that earlier detection and diagnosis may help patients plan for their future, achieve a better quality of life, and access clinical trials and possible future disease modifying treatments. In this review, we explore whether digital tools for the early detection of dementia can or should be deployed, by assessing them against the principles of ethical screening programs. We conclude that while the importance of dementia as a health problem is unquestionable, significant challenges remain. There is no available treatment which improves the prognosis of diagnosed disease. Progression from early-stage disease to dementia is neither given nor currently predictable. Available technologies are generally not both minimally invasive and highly accurate. Digital deployment risks exacerbating health inequalities due to biased training data and inequity in digital access. Finally, the acceptability of early dementia detection is not established, and resources would be needed to ensure follow-up and support for those flagged by any new system. We conclude that early dementia detection deployed at scale via digital technologies does not meet standards for a screening program and we offer recommendations for moving toward an ethical mode of implementation.

    "abstract": "In its AI Act, the European Union chose to understand trustworthiness of AI in terms of the acceptability of its risks. Based on a narrative systematic literature review on institutional trust and AI in the public sector, this article argues that the EU adopted a simplistic conceptualization of trust and is overselling its regulatory ambition. The paper begins by reconstructing the conflation of \"trustworthiness\" with \"acceptability\" in the AI Act. It continues by developing a prescriptive set of variables for reviewing trust research in the context of AI. The paper then uses those variables for a narrative review of prior research on trust and trustworthiness in AI in the public sector. Finally, it relates the findings of the review to the EU's AI policy. Its prospects to successfully engineer citizen's trust are uncertain. There remains a threat of misalignment between levels of actual trust and the trustworthiness of applied AI.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the current application of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the teaching of ultrasound skills as they pertain to gynaecological ultrasound.\nA scoping review was performed. Eight databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMCARE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore and ACM digital library) were searched in December 2022 using predefined keywords. All types of publications were eligible for inclusion so long as they reported the use of an AI tool, included reference to or discussion of teaching or the improvement of ultrasound skills and pertained to gynaecological ultrasound. Conference abstracts and non-English language papers which could not be adequately translated into English were excluded.\nThe initial database search returned 481 articles. After screening against our inclusion and exclusion criteria, two were deemed to meet the inclusion criteria. Neither of the articles included reported original research (one systematic review and one review article). Neither of the included articles explicitly provided details of specific tools developed for the teaching of ultrasound skills for gynaecological imaging but highlighted similar applications within the field of obstetrics which could potentially be expanded.\nArtificial intelligence can potentially assist in the training of sonographers and other ultrasound operators, including in the field of gynaecological ultrasound. This scoping review revealed however that to date, no original research has been published reporting the use or development of such a tool specifically for gynaecological ultrasound.",

    "abstract": "Fluid intelligence is a cognitive domain that encompasses general reasoning, pattern recognition, and problem-solving abilities independent of task-specific experience. Understanding its genetic and neural underpinnings is critical yet challenging for predicting human development, lifelong health, and well-being. One approach to address this challenge is to map the network of correlations between intelligence and other constructs. In the current study, we performed a genome-wide association study using fluid intelligence quotient scores from the UK Biobank to explore the genetic architecture of the associations between obesity risk and fluid intelligence. Our results revealed novel common genetic loci (",

    "abstract": "Papilledema is a pathology delineated by the swelling of the optic disc secondary to raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Diagnosis by ophthalmoscopy can be useful in the timely stratification of further investigations, such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography to rule out pathologies associated with raised ICP. In resource-limited settings, in particular, access to trained specialists or radiological imaging may not always be readily available, and accurate fundoscopy-based identification of papilledema could be a useful tool for triage and escalation to tertiary care centres. Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a rise in neuro-ophthalmology research in recent years, but there are many barriers to the translation of AI to clinical practice. The objective of this systematic review is to garner and present a comprehensive overview of the existing evidence on the application of AI in ophthalmoscopy for papilledema, and to provide a valuable perspective on this emerging field that sits at the intersection of clinical medicine and computer science, highlighting possible avenues for future research in this domain.",

    "abstract": "On the basis of extracting mechanomyography (MMG) signal features, the classification of hand movements has certain application values in human-machine interaction systems and wearable devices. In this paper, pattern recognition of hand movements based on MMG signal is studied with swarm intelligence algorithms introduced to optimize support vector machine (SVM). Time domain (TD) features, wavelet packet node energy (WPNE) features, frequency domain (FD) features, convolution neural network (CNN) features were extracted from each channel to constitute different feature sets. Three novel swarm intelligence algorithms (i.e., bald eagle search (BES), sparrow search algorithm (SSA), grey wolf optimization (GWO)) optimized SVM is proposed to train the models and recognition of hand movements are tested for each MMG feature extraction method. Using GWO as the optimization algorithm, time consumption is less than using the other two swarm algorithms. Using GWO with TD+FD features can obtain the classification accuracy of 93.55\u00a0%, which is higher than other methods while using CNN to extract features can be independent of domain knowledge. The results confirm GWO-SVM with TD\u00a0+\u00a0FD features is superior to some other methods in the classification problem for tiny samples based on MMG.",

    "abstract": "US is a widely available, commonly used, and indispensable imaging modality for breast evaluation. It is often the primary imaging modality for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer in low-resource settings. In addition, it is frequently employed as a supplemental screening tool via either whole breast handheld US or automated breast US among women with dense breasts. In recent years, a variety of artificial intelligence systems have been developed to assist radiologists with the detection and diagnosis of breast lesions on US. This article reviews the background and evidence supporting the use of artificial intelligence tools for breast US, describes implementation strategies and impact on clinical workflow, and discusses potential emerging roles and future directions.",

    "abstract": "There is great interest in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications for medical imaging in general and specifically in breast imaging. Because of the scale of application and the potential for harm, there has been a parallel interest in assuring that these new technologies are scrutinized and applied in ethical ways. The four principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice are widely accepted as a framework for bioethical analysis. We incorporate a fifth principle of explicability (adapted from Floridi and Cowls) because of the unique considerations of AI. We review definitions of each of these principles and provide examples of their practical application to breast imaging.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to assess the \"real-world\" impact of an artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed to detect breast cancer in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) screening exams following 12 months of utilization in a subspecialized academic breast center.\nFollowing IRB approval, mammography audit reports, as specified in the BI-RADS atlas, were retrospectively generated for five radiologists reading at three locations during a 12-month time frame. One location had the AI tool (iCAD ProFound AI v2.0), and the other two locations did not. The co-primary endpoints were cancer detection rate (CDR) and abnormal interpretation rate (AIR). Secondary endpoints included positive predictive values (PPVs) for cancer among screenings with abnormal interpretations (PPV1) and for biopsies performed (PPV3). Odds ratios (OR) with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) summarized the impact of AI across radiologists using generalized estimating equations.\nNonsignificant differences were observed in CDR, AIR, and PPVs. The CDR was 7.3 with AI and 5.9 without AI (OR 1.3, 95% CI: 0.9-1.7). The AIR was 11.7% with AI and 11.8% without AI (OR 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8-1.3). The PPV1 was 6.2% with AI and 5.0% without AI (OR 1.3, 95% CI: 0.97-1.7). The PPV3 was 33.3% with AI and 32.0% without AI (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.8-1.5).\nAlthough we are unable to show statistically significant changes in CDR and AIR outcomes in the two groups, the results are consistent with prior reader studies. There is a nonsignificant trend toward improvement in CDR with AI, without significant increases in AIR.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effectiveness of a new strategy for using artificial intelligence (AI) as supporting reader for the detection of breast cancer in mammography-based double reading screening practice.\nLarge-scale multi-site, multi-vendor data were used to retrospectively evaluate a new paradigm of AI-supported reading. Here, the AI served as the second reader only if it agrees with the recall/no-recall decision of the first human reader. Otherwise, a second human reader made an assessment followed by the standard clinical workflow. The data included 280 594 cases from 180 542 female participants screened for breast cancer at seven screening sites in two countries and using equipment from four hardware vendors. The statistical analysis included non-inferiority and superiority testing of cancer screening performance and evaluation of the reduction in workload, measured as arbitration rate and number of cases requiring second human reading.\nArtificial intelligence as a supporting reader was found to be superior or noninferior on all screening metrics compared with human double reading while reducing the number of cases requiring second human reading by up to 87% (245 395/280 594). Compared with AI as an independent reader, the number of cases referred to arbitration was reduced from 13% (35 199/280 594) to 2% (5056/280 594).\nThe simulation indicates that the proposed workflow retains screening performance of human double reading while substantially reducing the workload. Further research should study the impact on the second human reader because they would only assess cases in which the AI prediction and first human reader disagree.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) in breast imaging is a rapidly developing field with promising results. Despite the large number of recent publications in this field, unanswered questions have led to limited implementation of AI into daily clinical practice for breast radiologists. This paper provides an overview of the key limitations of AI in breast imaging including, but not limited to, limited numbers of FDA-approved algorithms and annotated data sets with histologic ground truth; concerns surrounding data privacy, security, algorithm transparency, and bias; and ethical issues. Ultimately, the successful implementation of AI into clinical care will require thoughtful action to address these challenges, transparency, and sharing of AI implementation workflows, limitations, and performance metrics within the breast imaging community and other end-users.",

    "abstract": "A sizable percentage of the population in India still does not have easy access to dental facilities. Therefore, it is of interest to document the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in oral surveillance of underserved communities. Available data shows that AI makes it possible to screen, diagnose, track, prioritize, and monitor dental patients remotely via smart devices. As a result, dentists won't have to deal with simple situations that only require standard treatments; freeing them up to focus on more complicated cases. Additionally, this would allow dentists to reach a broader, more underprivileged population in difficult-to-reach places. AI fracture recognition and categorization performance has shown promise in preliminary testing. Methods for detecting aberrations are frequently employed in public health practise and research continues to be focused on them.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in augmented reality led to planning and navigation systems for orthopedic surgery. However little is known about mixed reality (MR) in orthopedics. Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to boost the capabilities of MR by enabling automation and personalization. The purpose of this work is to assess Holoknee prototype, based on AI and MR for multimodal data visualization and surgical planning in knee osteotomy, developed to run on the HoloLens 2 headset.\nTwo preclinical test sessions were performed with 11 participants (eight surgeons, two residents, and one medical student) executing three times six tasks, corresponding to a number of holographic data interactions and preoperative planning steps. At the end of each session, participants answered a questionnaire on user perception and usability.\nDuring the second trial, the participants were faster in all tasks than in the first one, while in the third one, the time of execution decreased only for two tasks (\"Patient selection\" and \"Scrolling through radiograph\") with respect to the second attempt, but without statistically significant difference (respectively [Formula: see text] = 0.14 and [Formula: see text] = 0.13, [Formula: see text]). All subjects strongly agreed that MR can be used effectively for surgical training, whereas 10 (90.9%) strongly agreed that it can be used effectively for preoperative planning. Six (54.5%) agreed and two of them (18.2%) strongly agreed that it can be used effectively for intraoperative guidance.\nIn this work, we presented Holoknee, the first holistic application of AI and MR for surgical planning for knee osteotomy. It reported promising results on its potential translation to surgical training, preoperative planning, and surgical guidance. Clinical and Translational Impact Statement - Holoknee can be helpful to support surgeons in the preoperative planning of knee osteotomy. It has the potential to impact positively the training of the future generation of residents and aid surgeons in the intraoperative stage.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly a part of our everyday lives. Though much AI work in healthcare has been outside of applied behavior analysis (ABA), researchers within ABA have begun to demonstrate many different ways that AI might improve the delivery of ABA services. Though AI offers many exciting advances, absent from the behavior analytic literature thus far is conversation around ethical considerations when developing, building, and deploying AI technologies. Further, though AI is already in the process of coming to ABA, it is unknown the extent to which behavior analytic practitioners are familiar (and comfortable) with the use of AI in ABA. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, to describe how existing ethical publications (e.g., BACB Code of Ethics) do and do not speak to the unique ethical concerns with deploying AI in everyday, ABA service delivery settings. Second, to raise questions for consideration that might inform future ethical guidelines when developing and using AI in ABA service delivery. In total, we hope this article sparks proactive dialog around the ethical use of AI in ABA before the field is required to have a reactionary conversation.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to affect nearly every aspect of our daily lives and nearly every industry and profession. Many readers of this journal likely work in one or more areas of behavioral health. For readers who work in behavioral health and who are interested in AI, the purpose of this article is to highlight the pervasiveness of AI research being conducted around many facets of behavioral health service delivery. To do this, we first provide a brief overview of some of the areas within AI and the types of problems each area of AI attempts to solve. We then outline the prototypical client journey in behavioral healthcare beginning with diagnosis/assessment and ending with intervention withdrawal or ongoing monitoring. Next, for each stage in the client journey, we highlight several areas that parallel existing behavior analytic practice where researchers have begun to use AI, often to improve the efficiency of service delivery or to learn new things that improve the effectiveness of behavioral health services. Finally, for those whose appetite has been whet for getting involved with AI, we close by describing three roles they might consider trying out and that parallel the three main domains of behavior analysis. These three roles are an AI tool designer (akin to EAB), AI tool implementer (akin to ABA), or AI tool supporter (akin to practice).",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly advanced in various domains, including its application in psychotherapy. AI-powered psychotherapy tools present promising solutions for increasing accessibility to mental health care. However, the integration of AI in psychotherapy raises significant ethical concerns that require thorough consideration and regulation to ensure ethical practice, patient safety, and data privacy. This article discusses the ethical considerations surrounding the utilization of AI in psychotherapy, emphasizing the need for responsible implementation, patient privacy, and the human-AI interaction. The challenge raised by the use of artificial intelligence requires a comprehensive approach. Schools, in particular, are crucial in providing both knowledge and ethical guidance, helping young individuals decipher the complexities of online content. Additionally, parental support is essential, requiring the provision of time, fostering relationships, encouraging dialogue, and creating a safe environment to share experiences amidst the intricacies of adolescence. Reimagining social and healthcare services tailored for adolescents is equally crucial, taking into account recent societal changes. The integration of AI in psychotherapy has vast potential to transform mental healthcare. However, ensuring its accuracy and effectiveness demands a proactive approach to address associated ethical considerations. By adopting responsible practices, preserving patient autonomy, and continually refining AI systems, the field can leverage the benefits of AI in psychotherapy while maintaining high ethical standards.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare is a topic of significant concern within the academic and business sectors. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable effect on the health of people worldwide. The rapid increase in cases adversely affects a nation's economy, public health, and residents' social and personal well-being. Improving the precision of COVID-19 infection forecasts can aid in making informed decisions regarding interventions, given the pandemic's harmful impact on numerous aspects of human life, such as health and the economy. This study aims to predict the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia using Bayesian optimization (BOA) and deep learning (DL) methods. Two methods were assessed for their efficacy in predicting the occurrence of positive cases of COVID-19. The research employed data from confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia (SA), the United Kingdom (UK), and Tunisia (TU) from 2020 to 2021. The findings from the BOA model indicate that accurately predicting the number of COVID-19 positive cases is difficult due to the BOA projections needing to align with the assumptions. Thus, a DL approach was utilized to enhance the precision of COVID-19 positive case prediction in South Africa. The DQN model performed better than the BOA model when assessing RMSE and MAPE values. The model operates on a local server infrastructure, where the trained policy is transmitted solely to DQN. DQN formulated a reward function to amplify the efficiency of the DQN algorithm. By examining the rate of change and duration of sleep in the test data, this function can enhance the DQN model's training. Based on simulation findings, it can decrease the DQN work cycle by roughly 28% and diminish data overhead by more than 50% on average.",

    "abstract": "Online questionnaires that use crowdsourcing platforms to recruit participants have become commonplace, due to their ease of use and low costs. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based large language models (LLMs) have made it easy for bad actors to automatically fill in online forms, including generating meaningful text for open-ended tasks. These technological advances threaten the data quality for studies that use online questionnaires. This study tested whether text generated by an AI for the purpose of an online study can be detected by both humans and automatic AI detection systems. While humans were able to correctly identify the authorship of such text above chance level (76% accuracy), their performance was still below what would be required to ensure satisfactory data quality. Researchers currently have to rely on a lack of interest among bad actors to successfully use open-ended responses as a useful tool for ensuring data quality. Automatic AI detection systems are currently completely unusable. If AI submissions of responses become too prevalent, then the costs associated with detecting fraudulent submissions will outweigh the benefits of online questionnaires. Individual attention checks will no longer be a sufficient tool to ensure good data quality. This problem can only be systematically addressed by crowdsourcing platforms. They cannot rely on automatic AI detection systems and it is unclear how they can ensure data quality for their paying clients.",

    "abstract": "Rare diseases (RDs) are rare complex genetic diseases affecting a conservative estimate of 300 million people worldwide. Recent Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) studies are unraveling the underlying genetic heterogeneity of this group of diseases. NGS-based methods used in RDs studies have improved the diagnosis and management of RDs. Concomitantly, a suite of bioinformatics tools has been developed to sort through big data generated by NGS to understand RDs better. However, there are concerns regarding the lack of consistency among different methods, primarily linked to factors such as the lack of uniformity in input and output formats, the absence of a standardized measure for predictive accuracy, and the regularity of updates to the annotation database. Today, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning, is widely used in a variety of biological contexts, changing the healthcare system. AI has demonstrated promising capabilities in boosting variant calling precision, refining variant prediction, and enhancing the user-friendliness of electronic health record (EHR) systems in NGS-based diagnostics. This paper reviews the state of the art of AI in NGS-based genetics, and its future directions and challenges. It also compare several rare disease databases.",

    "abstract": "Skin-interfaced electronics is gradually changing medical practices by enabling continuous and noninvasive tracking of physiological and biochemical information. With the rise of big data and digital medicine, next-generation electronic skin (e-skin) will be able to use artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize its design as well as uncover user-personalized health profiles. Recent multimodal e-skin platforms have already employed machine learning (ML) algorithms for autonomous data analytics. Unfortunately, there is a lack of appropriate AI protocols and guidelines for e-skin devices, resulting in overly complex models and non-reproducible conclusions for simple applications. This review aims to present AI technologies in e-skin hardware and assess their potential for new inspired integrated platform solutions. We outline recent breakthroughs in AI strategies and their applications in engineering e-skins as well as understanding health information collected by e-skins, highlighting the transformative deployment of AI in robotics, prosthetics, virtual reality, and personalized healthcare. We also discuss the challenges and prospects of AI-powered e-skins as well as predictions for the future trajectory of smart e-skins.",

    "abstract": "To determine if there was an association between intrapartum stillbirths and both traveled distance for delivery and delivery care accessibility, assessing periods before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis is a population-based cohort study. Patients had birth occurring after the onset of labor; the primary outcome was intrapartum stillbirth. City of residence was classified according to the ratio between deliveries performed and total births among its residents; values lower than 0.1 indicated low delivery care accessibility. Travel distance was calculated using the Haversine formula. Education level, maternal age, and birth sex were included. In each period, relative risk was assessed by generalized linear model with Poisson variance.\nThere were 2 267 534 deliveries with birth occurring after the onset of labor. Most patients were between age 20 and 35 years, had between 8 and 11 years of education, and resided in cities with high delivery care accessibility. Low delivery care accessibility increased risk of intrapartum stillbirth in the pre-pandemic (relative risk [RR] 2.02; 95% CI [1.64, 2.47]; \nLow delivery care accessibility is associated with the risk of intrapartum stillbirths, and accessibility reduced during the pandemic. Delivery of patients by family physicians and midwives, as well as official communication channels between primary care physicians and specialists, could improve patient healthcare-seeking behavior.\nThe SPIRIT 2013 statement aims to improve the completeness of clinical trial protocol reporting by providing evidence-based recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed. This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human-AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial.\nA declara\u00e7\u00e3o SPIRIT 2013 tem como objetivo melhorar a integralidade dos relat\u00f3rios dos protocolos de ensaios cl\u00ednicos, fornecendo recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es baseadas em evid\u00eancias para o conjunto m\u00ednimo de itens que devem ser abordados.

    "abstract": "Missed fractures are a costly healthcare issue, not only negatively impacting patient lives, leading to potential long-term disability and time off work, but also responsible for high medicolegal disbursements that could otherwise be used to improve other healthcare services. When fractures are overlooked in children, they are particularly concerning as opportunities for safeguarding may be missed. Assistance from artificial intelligence (AI) in interpreting medical images may offer a possible solution for improving patient care, and several commercial AI tools are now available for radiology workflow implementation. However, information regarding their development, evidence for performance and validation as well as the intended target population is not always clear, but vital when evaluating a potential AI solution for implementation. In this article, we review the range of available products utilizing AI for fracture detection (in both adults and children) and summarize the evidence, or lack thereof, behind their performance. This will allow others to make better informed decisions when deciding which product to procure for their specific clinical requirements.",

    "abstract": "Radiomics and artificial intelligence carry the promise of increased precision in oncologic imaging assessments due to the ability of harnessing thousands of occult digital imaging features embedded in conventional medical imaging data. While powerful, these technologies suffer from a number of sources of variability that currently impede clinical translation. In order to overcome this impediment, there is a need to control for these sources of variability through harmonization of imaging data acquisition across institutions, construction of standardized imaging protocols that maximize the acquisition of these features, harmonization of post-processing techniques, and big data resources to properly power studies for hypothesis testing. For this to be accomplished, it will be critical to have multidisciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration.",

    "abstract": "The CONSORT 2010 statement provides minimum guidelines for reporting randomized trials. Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency in the evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human-AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes.\nLa declaraci\u00f3n CONSORT 2010 proporciona unas directrices m\u00ednimas para informar sobre los ensayos cl\u00ednicos aleatorizados. Su uso generalizado ha sido fundamental para garantizar la transparencia en la evaluaci\u00f3n de nuevas intervenciones. M\u00e1s recientemente, se ha reconocido cada vez m\u00e1s que las intervenciones con inteligencia artificial (IA) deben someterse a una evaluaci\u00f3n rigurosa y prospectiva para demostrar su impacto en la salud.

Ambas directrices se desarrollaron a trav\u00e9s de un proceso de consenso por etapas que inclu\u00eda la revisi\u00f3n de la literatura y la consulta a expertos para generar 29 elementos candidatos, que fueron evaluados por un grupo internacional de m\u00faltiples partes interesadas en una encuesta Delphi de dos etapas (103 partes interesadas congregados en una reuni\u00f3n de consenso de dos d\u00edas (31 partes interesadas) y refinados a trav\u00e9s de una lista de verificaci\u00f3n piloto (34 participantes). La ampliaci\u00f3n del CONSORT-AI incluye 14 nuevos elementos que se consideraron lo suficientemente importantes para las intervenciones de IA como para que se informen de forma rutinaria, adem\u00e1s de los elementos b\u00e1sicos del CONSORT 2010. CONSORT-AI recomienda que los investigadores proporcionen descripciones claras de la intervenci\u00f3n de IA, incluyendo las instrucciones y las habilidades requeridas para su uso, el entorno en el que se integra la intervenci\u00f3n de IA, el manejo de los datos de entrada y los datos de salida de la intervenci\u00f3n de IA, la interacci\u00f3n entre el ser humano y la IA y la provisi\u00f3n de un an\u00e1lisis de los casos de error. CONSORT-AI ayudar\u00e1 a promover la transparencia y la exhaustividad en los informes de los ensayos cl\u00ednicos de las intervenciones de AI, tambi\u00e9n ayudar\u00e1 a los editores y revisores, as\u00ed como a los lectores en general, a entender, interpretar y valorar cr\u00edticamente la calidad del dise\u00f1o del ensayo cl\u00ednico y el riesgo de sesgo en los resultados comunicados.\nA declara\u00e7\u00e3o CONSORT 2010 apresenta diretrizes m\u00ednimas para relat\u00f3rios de ensaios cl\u00ednicos randomizados.

A total of 1091 patients were analyzed for pressure gradient predictions (mean age 76.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.2\u00a0years, 57.8% male), and 1063 patients were analyzed for aortic valve area predictions (mean age 76.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.3\u00a0years, 57.2% male). An artificial intelligence learning model was trained (training: n\u00a0=\u00a0663 patients, validation: n\u00a0=\u00a0206 patients) and tested (testing: n\u00a0=\u00a0222 patients) to predict pressure gradient, and a separate artificial intelligence learning model was trained (training: n\u00a0=\u00a0640 patients, validation: n\u00a0=\u00a0218 patients) and tested (testing: n\u00a0=\u00a0205 patients) for predicting aortic valve area.\nThe mean absolute error for pressure gradient and aortic valve area predictions was 3.0\u00a0mm Hg and 0.45\u00a0cm\nThe artificial intelligence-based algorithm has demonstrated potential in predicting post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement transvalvular pressure gradient predictions for patients with aortic valve stenosis. Further studies are necessary to differentiate pressure gradient between valve types.",

    "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology with vast potential for use in several fields of medicine. However, little is known about the application of AI in treatment decisions for patients with polytrauma. In this systematic review, we investigated the benefits and performance of AI in predicting the management of patients with polytrauma and trauma.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were extracted from the PubMed and Google Scholar databases from their inception until November 2022, using the search terms \"Artificial intelligence,\" \"polytrauma,\" and \"decision.\" Seventeen articles were identified and screened for eligibility. Animal studies, review articles, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and studies that did not involve polytrauma or severe trauma management decisions were excluded. Eight studies were eligible for final review.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Eight studies focusing on patients with trauma, including two on military trauma, were included. The AI applications were mainly implemented for predictions and/or decisions on shock, bleeding, and blood transfusion. Few studies predicted death/survival. The identification of trauma patients using AI was proposed in a previous study. The overall performance of AI was good (six studies), excellent (one study), and acceptable (one study).&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussion:&lt;/b&gt; AI demonstrated satisfactory performance in decision-making and management prediction in patients with polytrauma/severe trauma, especially in situations of shock/bleeding.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Importance:&lt;/b&gt; The present study serves as a basis for further research to develop practical AI applications for the management of patients with trauma.&lt;/br&gt.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is being tested and deployed in major hospitals to monitor patients, leading to improved health outcomes, lower costs, and time savings. This uptake is in its infancy, with new applications being considered. In this Article, the challenges of deploying AI in mental health wards are examined by reference to AI surveillance systems, suicide prediction and hospital administration. The examination highlights risks surrounding patient privacy, informed consent, and data considerations. Overall, these risks indicate that AI should only be used in a psychiatric ward after careful deliberation, caution, and ongoing reappraisal.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is transforming radiation oncology. As prominent vanguards of AGI, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and PaLM 2 can process extensive texts and large vision models (LVMs) such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) can process extensive imaging data to enhance the efficiency and precision of radiation therapy. This paper explores full-spectrum applications of AGI across radiation oncology including initial consultation, simulation, treatment planning, treatment delivery, treatment verification, and patient follow-up. The fusion of vision data with LLMs also creates powerful multimodal models that elucidate nuanced clinical patterns. Together, AGI promises to catalyze a shift towards data-driven, personalized radiation therapy. However, these models should complement human expertise and care. This paper provides an overview of how AGI can transform radiation oncology to elevate the standard of patient care in radiation oncology, with the key insight being AGI's ability to exploit multimodal clinical data at scale.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of drugs against emerging and re-emerging viruses is required to prevent future pandemics. However, inhibitors usually take a long time to optimize. Here, to improve the optimization step, we used two heptad repeats (HR) in the spike protein (S protein) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a model and established a screening system for peptide-based inhibitors containing an \u03b1-helix region (SPICA). SPICA can be used to identify critical amino acid regions and evaluate the inhibitory effects of peptides as decoys. We further employed an artificial intelligence structure-prediction system (AlphaFold2) for the rapid analysis of structure-activity relationships. Here, we identified that critical amino acid regions, DVDLGD (amino acids 1163-1168 in the S protein), IQKEIDRLNE (1179-1188), and NLNESLIDL (1192-1200), played a pivotal role in SARS-CoV-2 fusion. Peptides containing these critical amino acid regions efficiently blocked viral replication. We also demonstrated that AlphaFold2 could successfully predict structures similar to the reported crystal and cryo-electron microscopy structures of the post-fusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Notably, the predicted structures of the HR1 region and the peptide-based fusion inhibitors corresponded well with the antiviral effects of each fusion inhibitor. Thus, the combination of SPICA and AlphaFold2 is a powerful tool to design viral fusion inhibitors using only the amino-acid sequence of the fusion protein.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence or AI may be identified as the use of Personal Computers and/or machines in performing certain specific types of tasks that usually have the requirement of humanized knowledge. These specific tasks include acknowledgment of the problem, understanding disease dynamics, and determining the clinical diagnosis.\nThis cross-sectional and prospective study was conducted on Dental professionals who were practicing all across India after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethical Board. A previously validated as well as pre-analyzed questionnaire form was distributed using electronic mail and through the use of social media with a briefly explained description of the study purpose and an informed consent form. The study questionnaire comprised \"close-ended\" queries that were then divided into foursections. All the study participants were then instructed to select any one option among all the provided answers. The entire study was completed within one month. Collected observations were entered within a Microsoft Excel 2007\u00ae master chart. Statistical analytical software tool SPSS version 20.0, IBM Corporation was employed. \"Chi-square\" test was performed for evaluating statistical association. A \nOn analyzing the level of knowledge, 82.5% of subjects had knowledge of artificial intelligence while 11.4% had no knowledge and 6.1% had some knowledge of this tool. 69.1% were knowledgeable regarding the use of AI in lesional diagnosis, 12.8% had no knowledge regarding artificial intelligence for the diagnosis and 18.1% had no knowledge regarding AI in the diagnosis. 71% had knowledge concerning the use of AI for Imaging. Knowledge of AI in Oral Hygiene was seen in 54.3%. 91.2% of participants had knowledge of robotics use in Oral Surgery. 77% of dentists had knowledge regarding the use of AI for the enhancement of clinical practice. 95.5% had a higher 'positive' attitude toward the use of AI in academics. 69.1% of dentists had a positive attitude regarding AI incorporation in practice. 5% of dentists considered artificial intelligence better than human intelligence for diagnosis. 10% believed that disparities can exist between AI-based and human diagnosis.\nPositive correlations were noted between knowledge, attitude, and practice of AI among studied dentists.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of novel medical technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), into traditional clinical practice presents legal liability challenges that need to be squarely addressed by litigants and courts when something goes wrong. Some of the most promising applications for the use of AI in medicine will lead to vexed liability questions. As AI in health care is in its relative infancy, there is a paucity of case law globally upon which to draw. This article analyses medical malpractice where AI is involved, what problems arise when applying the tort of negligence - such as establishing the essential elements of breach of duty of care and causation - and how can these can be addressed. Product liability under Australian Consumer Law is beyond the scope of this article. In order to address this question, the article: (1) identifies the general problems that black box AI causes in the health care sector; (2) identifies the problems that will arise in establishing breach and causation due to the \"black box\" nature of AI, with reference to the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) and common law through two hypothetical examples; and (3) considers selected legal solutions to the problems caused by \"black box\" AI.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has disrupted modern workplaces like never before and has induced digital workstyles. These technological advancements are generating significant interest among HR leaders to embrace AI in human resource management (HRM). Researchers and practitioners are keen to investigate the adoption of AI in HRM and the resultant human-machine collaboration. This study investigates HRM specific factors that enable and inhibit the adoption of AI in extended HR ecosystems and adopts a qualitative case research design with an abductive approach. It studies three well-known Indian companies at different stages of AI adoption in HR functions. This research investigates key enablers such as optimistic and collaborative employees, strong digital leadership, reliable HR data, specialized HR partners, and well-rounded AI ethics. The study also examines barriers to adoption: the inability to have a timely pulse check of employees' emotions, ineffective collaboration of HR employees with digital experts as well as external HR partners, and not embracing AI ethics. This study contributes to the theory by providing a model for AI adoption and proposes additions to the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology in the context of AI adoption in HR ecosystems. The study also contributes to the best-in-class industry HR practices and digital policy formulation to reimagine workplaces, promote harmonious human-AI collaboration, and make workplaces future-ready in the wake of massive digital disruptions.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairments are a prevalent consequence of acquired brain injury, dementia, and age-related cognitive decline, hampering individuals' daily functioning and independence, with significant societal and economic implications. While neurorehabilitation represents a promising avenue for addressing these deficits, traditional rehabilitation approaches face notable limitations. First, they lack adaptability, offering one-size-fits-all solutions that may not effectively meet each patient's unique needs. Furthermore, the resource-intensive nature of these interventions, often confined to clinical settings, poses barriers to widespread, cost-effective, and sustained implementation, resulting in suboptimal outcomes in terms of intervention adaptability, intensity, and duration. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces NeuroAIreh@b, an innovative cognitive profiling and training methodology that uses an AI-driven framework to optimize neurorehabilitation prescription. NeuroAIreh@b effectively bridges the gap between neuropsychological assessment and computational modeling, thereby affording highly personalized and adaptive neurorehabilitation sessions. This approach also leverages virtual reality-based simulations of daily living activities to enhance ecological validity and efficacy. The feasibility of NeuroAIreh@b has already been demonstrated through a clinical study with stroke patients employing a tablet-based intervention. The NeuroAIreh@b methodology holds the potential for efficacy studies in large randomized controlled trials in the future.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with radiotherapy can benefit patients with localized prostate cancer. However, ADT can negatively impact quality of life, and there remain no validated predictive models to guide its use. METHODS: We used digital pathology images from pretreatment prostate tissue and clinical data from 5727 patients enrolled in five phase 3 randomized trials, in which treatment was radiotherapy with or without ADT, as our data source to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)\u2013derived predictive patient-specific model that would determine which patients would develop the primary end point of distant metastasis. The model used baseline data to provide a binary output that a given patient will likely benefit from ADT or not. After the model was locked, validation was performed using data from NRG Oncology/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9408 (n=1594), a trial that randomly assigned men to radiotherapy plus or minus 4\u2009months of ADT. Fine\u2013Gray regression and restricted mean survival times were used to assess the interaction between treatment and the predictive model and within predictive model\u2013positive, i.e., benefited from ADT, and \u2013negative subgroup treatment effects. RESULTS: Overall, in the NRG/RTOG 9408 validation cohort (14.9\u2009years of median follow-up), ADT significantly improved time to distant metastasis. Of these enrolled patients, 543 (34%) were model positive, and ADT significantly reduced the risk of distant metastasis compared with radiotherapy alone. Of 1051 patients who were model negative, ADT did not provide benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Our AI-based predictive model was able to identify patients with a predominantly intermediate risk for prostate cancer likely to benefit from short-term ADT.

    "abstract": "To evaluate mydriatic handheld retinal imaging performance assessed by point-of-care (POC) artificial intelligence (AI) as compared with retinal image graders at a centralized reading center (RC) in identifying diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME).\nProspective, comparative study.\nFive thousand five hundred eighty-five eyes from 2793 adult patients with diabetes.\nPoint-of-care AI assessment of disc and macular handheld retinal images was compared with RC evaluation of validated 5-field handheld retinal images (disc, macula, superior, inferior, and temporal) in identifying referable DR (refDR; defined as moderate nonproliferative DR [NPDR], or worse, or any level of DME) and vision-threatening DR (vtDR; defined as severe NPDR or worse, or any level of center-involving DME [ciDME]). Reading center evaluation of the 5-field images followed the international DR/DME classification. Sensitivity (SN) and specificity (SP) for ungradable images, refDR, and vtDR were calculated.\nAgreement for DR and DME; SN and SP for refDR, vtDR, and ungradable images.\nDiabetic retinopathy severity by RC evaluation: no DR, 67.3%; mild NPDR, 9.7%; moderate NPDR, 8.6%; severe NPDR, 4.8%; proliferative DR, 3.8%; and ungradable, 5.8%. Diabetic macular edema severity by RC evaluation was as follows: no DME (80.4%), non-ciDME (7.7%), ciDME (4.4%), and ungradable (7.5%). Referable DR was present in 25.3% and vtDR was present in 17.5% of eyes. Images were ungradable for DR or DME in 7.5% by RC evaluation and 15.4% by AI. There was substantial agreement between AI and RC for refDR (\u03ba\u00a0= 0.66) and moderate agreement for vtDR (\u03ba\u00a0= 0.54). The SN/SP of AI grading compared with RC evaluation was 0.86/0.86 for refDR and 0.92/0.80 for vtDR.\nThis study demonstrates that POC AI following a defined handheld retinal imaging protocol at the time of imaging has SN and SP for refDR that meets the current United States Food and Drug Administration thresholds of 85% and 82.5%, but not for vtDR. Integrating AI at the POC could substantially reduce centralized RC burden and speed information delivery to the patient, allowing more prompt eye care referral.\nProprietary or commercial disclosure may be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence technology can be applied in several aspects of healthcare delivery and its integration into the Nigerian healthcare value chain is expected to bring about new opportunities. This study aimed at assessing the knowledge and perception of healthcare professionals in Nigeria regarding the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the health sector.\nA cross-sectional study was undertaken amongst healthcare professionals in Nigeria with the use of a questionnaire. Data were collected across the six geopolitical zones in the Country using a stratified multistage sampling method. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were undertaken for the data obtained.\nFemale participants (55.7%) were slightly higher in proportion compared to the male respondents (44.3%). Pharmacists accounted for 27.7% of the participants, and this was closely followed by medical doctors (24.5%) and nurses (19.3%). The majority of the respondents (57.2%) reported good knowledge regarding artificial intelligence and machine learning, about a third of the participants (32.2%) were of average knowledge, and 10.6% of the sample had poor knowledge. More than half of the respondents (57.8%) disagreed with the notion that the adoption of artificial intelligence in the Nigerian healthcare sector could result in job losses. Two-thirds of the participants (66.7%) were of the view that the integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare will augment human intelligence. Three-quarters (77%) of the respondents agreed that the use of machine learning in Nigerian healthcare could facilitate efficient service delivery.\nThis study provides novel insights regarding healthcare professionals' knowledge and perception with respect to the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in healthcare. The emergent findings from this study can guide government and policymakers in decision-making as regards deployment of artificial intelligence and machine learning for healthcare delivery.",

    "results": "Female participants (55.7%) were slightly higher in proportion compared to the male respondents (44.3%). Pharmacists accounted for 27.7% of the participants, and this was closely followed by medical doctors (24.5%) and nurses (19.3%). The majority of the respondents (57.2%) reported good knowledge regarding artificial intelligence and machine learning, about a third of the participants (32.2%) were of average knowledge, and 10.6% of the sample had poor knowledge. More than half of the respondents (57.8%) disagreed with the notion that the adoption of artificial intelligence in the Nigerian healthcare sector could result in job losses. Two-thirds of the participants (66.7%) were of the view that the integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare will augment human intelligence. Three-quarters (77%) of the respondents agreed that the use of machine learning in Nigerian healthcare could facilitate efficient service delivery.",

    "abstract": "Rituximab is a first-line treatment for membranous nephropathy. Nephrotic syndrome limits rituximab exposure due to urinary drug loss. Rituximab underdosing (serum level\u00a0<2 \u03bcg/ml at month-3) is a risk factor for treatment failure. We developed a machine learning algorithm to predict the risk of underdosing based on patients' characteristics at rituximab infusion. We investigated the relationship between the predicted risk of underdosing and the cumulative dose of rituximab required to achieve remission.\nRituximab concentrations were measured at month-3 in 92 sera from adult patients with primary membranous nephropathy, split into a training (75%) and a testing set (25%). A forward-backward machine-learning procedure determined the best combination of variables to predict rituximab underdosing in the training data set, which was tested in the test set. The performances were evaluated for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in 10-fold cross-validation training and test sets.\nThe best variables combination to predict rituximab underdosing included age, gender, body surface area (BSA), anti-phospholipase A2 receptor type 1 (anti-PLA2R1) antibody titer on day-0, serum albumin on day-0 and day-15, and serum creatinine on day-0 and day-15. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were respectively 79.4%, 78.7%, and 81.0% (training data set), and 79.2%, 84.6% and 72.7% (testing data set). In both sets, the algorithm performed significantly better than chance (\nThis algorithm could allow for early intensification of rituximab regimen in patients at high estimated risk of underdosing to increase the likelihood of remission.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the quality and readability of information regarding rotator cuff repair surgery available using an online AI software.\nAn open AI model (ChatGPT) was used to answer 24 commonly asked questions from patients on rotator cuff repair. Questions were stratified into one of three categories based on the Rothwell classification system: fact, policy, or value. The answers for each category were evaluated for reliability, quality and readability using The Journal of the American Medical Association Benchmark criteria, DISCERN score, Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease Score and Grade Level.\nThe Journal of the American Medical Association Benchmark criteria score for all three categories was 0, which is the lowest score indicating no reliable resources cited. The DISCERN score was 51 for fact, 53 for policy, and 55 for value questions, all of which are considered good scores. Across question categories, the reliability portion of the DISCERN score was low, due to a lack of resources. The Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease Score (and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level) was 48.3 (10.3) for the fact class, 42.0 (10.9) for the policy class, and 38.4 (11.6) for the value class.\nThe quality of information provided by the open AI chat system was generally high across all question types but had significant shortcomings in reliability due to the absence of source material citations. The DISCERN scores of the AI generated responses matched or exceeded previously published results of studies evaluating the quality of online information about rotator cuff repairs. The responses were U.S. 10",

    "abstract": "The SPIRIT 2013 statement aims to improve the completeness of clinical trial protocol reporting by providing evidence-based recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed. This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human-AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial.\nLa declaraci\u00f3n SPIRIT 2013 tiene como objetivo mejorar la exhaustividad de los informes de los protocolos de los ensayos cl\u00ednicos proporcionando recomendaciones basadas en la evidencia para el conjunto m\u00ednimo de elementos que deben abordarse. Esta gu\u00eda ha sido fundamental para promover la evaluaci\u00f3n transparente de nuevas intervenciones. M\u00e1s recientemente, se ha reconocido cada vez m\u00e1s que las intervenciones con inteligencia artificial (IA) deben someterse a una evaluaci\u00f3n rigurosa y prospectiva para demostrar su impacto en los resultados m\u00e9dicos. La extensi\u00f3n SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s) es una nueva directriz para el reporte de los protocolos de ensayos cl\u00ednicos que eval\u00faan intervenciones con un componente de IA. Esta directriz se desarroll\u00f3 en paralelo con su declaraci\u00f3n complementaria para los informes de ensayos cl\u00ednicos: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Ambas directrices se desarrollaron a trav\u00e9s de un proceso de consenso por etapas que inclu\u00eda la revisi\u00f3n de la literatura y la consulta a expertos para generar 26 \u00edtems candidatos, que fueron consultados por un grupo internacional de m\u00faltiples partes interesadas en una encuesta Delphi de dos etapas (103 partes interesadas), acordados en una reuni\u00f3n de consenso (31 partes interesadas) y refinados a trav\u00e9s de una lista de verificaci\u00f3n piloto (34 participantes). La ampliaci\u00f3n de SPIRIT-AI incluye 15 nuevos elementos que se consideraron suficientemente importantes para los protocolos de los ensayos cl\u00ednicos con intervenciones de IA. Estos nuevos \u00edtems deben ser reportados rutinariamente adem\u00e1s de los \u00edtems centrales de SPIRIT 2013. SPIRIT-AI recomienda que los investigadores proporcionen descripciones claras de la intervenci\u00f3n de IA, incluyendo las instrucciones y las habilidades necesarias para su uso, el entorno en el que se integrar\u00e1 la intervenci\u00f3n de IA, las consideraciones para el manejo de los datos de entrada y salida, la interacci\u00f3n entre el ser humano y la IA y el an\u00e1lisis de los casos de error. SPIRIT-AI ayudar\u00e1 a promover la transparencia y la exhaustividad de los protocolos de los ensayos cl\u00ednicos de las intervenciones de IA. Su uso ayudar\u00e1 a los editores y revisores, as\u00ed como a los lectores en general, a comprender, interpretar y valorar cr\u00edticamente el dise\u00f1o y el riesgo de sesgo de un futuro ensayo cl\u00ednico.\nA declara\u00e7\u00e3o SPIRIT 2013 tem como objetivo melhorar a integralidade dos relat\u00f3rios dos protocolos de ensaios cl\u00ednicos, fornecendo recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es baseadas em evid\u00eancias para o conjunto m\u00ednimo de itens que devem ser abordados.

    "abstract": "In the setting of underdiagnosed and undertreated perinatal depression (PD), Artificial intelligence (AI) solutions are poised to help predict and treat PD. In the near future, perinatal patients may interact with AI during clinical decision-making, in their patient portals, or through AI-powered chatbots delivering psychotherapy. The increase in potential AI applications has led to discussions regarding responsible AI and explainable AI (XAI). Current discussions of RAI, however, are limited in their consideration of the patient as an active participant with AI. Therefore, we propose a patient-centered, rather than a patient-adjacent, approach to RAI and XAI, that identifies autonomy, beneficence, justice, trust, privacy, and transparency as core concepts to uphold for health professionals and patients. We present empirical evidence that these principles are strongly valued by patients. We further suggest possible design solutions that uphold these principles and acknowledge the pressing need for further research about practical applications to uphold these principles.",

    "abstract": "In a drip-and-ship model for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT), early identification of large vessel occlusion (LVO) and timely referral to a comprehensive center (CSC) are crucial when patients are admitted to an acute stroke center (ASC). Several artificial intelligence (AI) decision-aid tools are increasingly being used to facilitate the rapid identification of LVO. This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the impact of deploying e-Stroke AI decision support software in the hyperacute stroke pathway on process metrics and patient outcomes at an ASC in the United Kingdom.\nExcept for the deployment of e-Stroke on 01 March 2020, there were no significant changes made to the stroke pathway at the ASC. The data were obtained from a prospective stroke registry between 01 January 2019 and 31 March 2021. The outcomes were compared between the 14\u2009months before and 12\u2009months after the deployment of AI (pre-e-Stroke cohort vs. post-e-Stroke cohort) on 01 March 2020. Time window analyses were performed using Welch's t-test. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to compare changes in disability at 3\u2009months assessed by modified Rankin Score (mRS) ordinal shift analysis, and Fisher's exact test was used for dichotomised mRS analysis.\nIn the pre-e-Stroke cohort, 19 of 22 patients referred received EVT. In the post-e-Stroke cohort, 21 of the 25 patients referred were treated. The mean door-in-door-out (DIDO) and door-to-referral times in pre-e-Stroke vs. post-e-Stroke cohorts were 141 vs. 79\u2009min (difference 62\u2009min, 95% CI 96.9-26.8\u2009min, \nIn this single-center study in the United Kingdom, the DIDO time significantly decreased since the introduction of e-Stroke decision support software into an ASC hyperacute stroke pathway. The reduction in door-in to referral time indicates faster image interpretation and referral for EVT. There was an indication of an increased proportion of patients regaining independent function after EVT. However, this should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size. Larger, prospective studies and further systematic real-world evaluation are needed to demonstrate the widespread generalisability of these findings.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of heart failure (HF) is increasing, necessitating accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment. The accumulation of clinical information from patients with HF generates big data, which poses challenges for traditional analytical methods. To address this, big data approaches and artificial intelligence (AI) have been developed that can effectively predict future observations and outcomes, enabling precise diagnoses and personalized treatments of patients with HF. Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that allows computers to analyze data, find patterns, and make predictions without explicit instructions. ML can be supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised. Deep learning is a branch of ML that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to find complex patterns. These AI technologies have shown significant potential in various aspects of HF research, including diagnosis, outcome prediction, classification of HF phenotypes, and optimization of treatment strategies. In addition, integrating multiple data sources, such as electrocardiography, electronic health records, and imaging data, can enhance the diagnostic accuracy of AI algorithms. Currently, wearable devices and remote monitoring aided by AI enable the earlier detection of HF and improved patient care. This review focuses on the rationale behind utilizing AI in HF and explores its various applications.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence is the self-perception related to identification and regulation of emotions. Several studies have been done among Indian teachers evaluating emotional intelligence in relation to demographic, professional and various psychological parameters, but the variety of scales, teacher types, and conflicting results makes it difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from this heterogeneous data.The present work aims to synthesize the available data by both qualitative and quantitative analysis and is the first such attempt to include only Indian studies in this field. The main objectives were to determine the correlation of emotional intelligence with teachers' health parameters and to study the gender difference in emotional intelligence.\nAfter a thorough literature search in Google, Google scholar, Scopus, Web of science and Pubmed, fifty-five Indian studies were selected which empirically examined teachers' emotional intelligence, either alone or in association with another parameter evaluating teachers' psychological health and performance. After qualitative assessment of major findings, quantitative analysis was performed. Three separate meta-analysis were carried out. The first one with fifteen effect sizes among 3291 participants evaluated correlation with personal health parameters. The second with nineteen effect sizes in 4165 participants evaluated correlation with professional health parameters. The third with twenty-six studies involving 6005 participants assessed effect of gender.\nThe results show that almost all studies have used a trait measure, teachers' emotional intelligence is positively correlated with both personal and professional health parameters and gender has no effect on emotional intelligence.\nMajor limitations are a very high degree of heterogeneity of the data, incomplete description of the scales, inadequate randomization and small sample sizes in many studies. The results indicate the importance of emotional intelligence in both personal and professional life of teachers and no effect of gender preparing a solid base for future research.",

    "abstract": "Given the severe effects that toxic compounds present in wastewater streams have on humans, it is imperative that water and wastewater streams pollution be addressed globally. This review comprehensively examines various water and wastewater treatment methods and water quality management methods based on artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning (ML) and AI have become a powerful tool for addressing problems in the real world and has gained a lot of interest since it can be used for a wide range of activities. The foundation of ML techniques involves training of a network with collected data, followed by application of learned network to the process simulation and prediction. The creation of ML models for process simulations requires measured data. In order to forecast and simulate chemical and physical processes such chemical reactions, heat transfer, mass transfer, energy, pharmaceutics and separation, a variety of machine-learning algorithms have recently been developed. These models have shown to be more adept at simulating and modeling processes than traditional models. Although AI offers many advantages, a number of disadvantages have kept these methods from being extensively applied in actual water treatment systems. Lack of evidence of application in actual water treatment scenarios, poor repeatability and data availability and selection are a few of the main problems that need to be resolved.",

    "abstract": "The study's purpose was to compare the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) in auto-contouring compared with a human practitioner in terms of precision, differences in dose distribution, and time consumption.\nDatasets of previously irradiated patients in 3 different segments (head and neck, breast, and prostate cancer) were retrospectively collected. An experienced radiation oncologist (MD) performed organs-at-risk (OARs) and standard clinical target volume delineations as baseline structures for comparison. AI-based autocontours were generated in 2 additional CT copies; therefore, 3 groups were assessed: MD alone, AI alone, and AI plus MD corrections (AI+C). Differences in Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and person-hour burden were assessed. Furthermore, changes in clinically relevant dose-volume parameters were evaluated and compared.\nSeventy-five previously treated cases were collected (25 per segment) for the analysis. Compared with MD contours, the mean DSC scores were higher than 0.7 for 74% and 80% of AI and AI+C, respectively. After corrections, 17.1% structures presented DSC score deviations higher than 0.1 and 10.4% dose-volume parameters significantly changed in AI-contoured structures. The time consumption assessment yielded mean person-hour reductions of 68%, 51%, and 71% for breast, prostate, and head and neck cancer, respectively.\nIn great extent, AI yielded clinically acceptable OARs and certain clinical target volumes in the explored anatomic segments. Sparse correction and assessment requirements place AI+C as a standard workflow. Minimal clinically relevant differences in OAR exposure were identified. A substantial amount of person-hours could be repurposed with this technology.",

    "abstract": "Domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are facing formidable challenges in effectively eliminating emerging pollutants and conventional nutrients. In microbiome engineering, two approaches have been developed: a top-down method focusing on domesticating seed microbiomes into engineered ones, and a bottom-up strategy that synthesizes engineered microbiomes from microbial isolates. However, these approaches face substantial hurdles that limit their real-world applicability in wastewater treatment engineering. Addressing this gap, we propose the creation of a Global WWTP Microbiome-based Integrative Information Platform, inspired by the untapped microbiome and engineering data from WWTPs and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). This open platform integrates microbiome and engineering information globally and utilizes AI-driven tools for identifying seed microbiomes for new plants, providing technical upgrades for existing facilities, and deploying microbiomes for accidental pollution remediation. Beyond its practical applications, this platform has significant scientific and social value, supporting multidisciplinary research, documenting microbial evolution, advancing Wastewater-Based Epidemiology, and enhancing global resource sharing. Overall, the platform is expected to enhance WWTPs' performance in pollution control, safeguarding a harmonious and healthy future for human society and the natural environment.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, offering potential benefits and challenges. In healthcare, AI enhances efficiency, streamlines processes, and supports decision-making. However, challenges include potential errors and biases in algorithms, data privacy concerns, legal and ethical issues, and resistance to change. In nursing, a delicate balance emerges between AI and human touch. While AI aids in data-driven decision-making and administrative tasks, it lacks the emotional intelligence, empathy, and nuanced understanding crucial to nursing care. Nurses excel in critical thinking, adaptability to dynamic situations, patient advocacy, collaboration, and establishing human connections. AI supports these functions by automating routine tasks and offering decision support tools, yet its rigidity in dynamic situations and lack of human touch pose limitations. This review underscores the necessity of careful AI integration in healthcare, acknowledging its advantages while mitigating drawbacks. In nursing, the symbiosis between AI and human qualities is vital. The role of AI should be to complement, not replace, the unique skills and empathetic aspects of nursing care. Addressing concerns related to bias, transparency, data privacy, and professional training is essential for maximizing the benefits of AI in healthcare while preserving the human touch in patient care. This article explores whether AI can replace unique nursing roles.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a complex and heterogeneous syndrome that remains a serious challenge to healthcare worldwide. Patients afflicted by severe sepsis or septic shock are customarily placed under intensive care unit (ICU) supervision, where a multitude of apparatus is poised to produce high-granularity data. This reservoir of high-quality data forms the cornerstone for the integration of AI into clinical practice. However, existing reviews currently lack the inclusion of the latest advancements. This review examines the evolving integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in sepsis management. Applications of artificial intelligence include early detection, subtyping analysis, precise treatment and prognosis assessment. AI-driven early warning systems provide enhanced recognition and intervention capabilities, while profiling analyzes elucidate distinct sepsis manifestations for targeted therapy. Precision medicine harnesses the potential of artificial intelligence for pathogen identification, antibiotic selection, and fluid optimization. In conclusion, the seamless amalgamation of artificial intelligence into the domain of sepsis management heralds a transformative shift, ushering in novel prospects to elevate diagnostic precision, therapeutic efficacy, and prognostic acumen. As AI technologies develop, their impact on shaping the future of sepsis care warrants ongoing research and thoughtful implementation.",

    "abstract": "While AI is widely used in biomedical research and medical practice, its use is constrained to few specific practical areas, e.g., radiomics. Participants of the workshop on \"Artificial Intelligence in Biology and Medicine\" (Jerusalem, Feb 14-15, 2023), both researchers and practitioners, aimed to build a holistic picture by exploring AI advancements, challenges and perspectives, as well as to suggest new fields for AI applications. Presentations showcased the potential of large language models (LLMs) in generating molecular structures, predicting protein-ligand interactions, and promoting democratization of AI development. Ethical concerns in medical decision making were also addressed. In biological applications, AI integration of multi-omics and clinical data elucidated the health relevant effects of low doses of ionizing radiation. Bayesian latent modeling identified statistical associations between unobserved variables. Medical applications highlighted liquid biopsy methods for non-invasive diagnostics, routine laboratory tests to identify overlooked illnesses, and AI's role in oral and maxillofacial imaging. Explainable AI and diverse image processing tools improved diagnostics, while text classification detected anorexic behavior in blog posts. The workshop fostered knowledge sharing, discussions, and emphasized the need for further AI development in radioprotection research in support of emerging public health issues. The organizers plan to continue the initiative as an annual event, promoting collaboration and addressing issues and perspectives in AI applications with a focus on low-dose radioprotection research. Researchers involved in radioprotection research and experts in relevant public policy domains are invited to explore the utility of AI in low-dose radiation research at the next workshop.",

    "abstract": "The study of bioactive molecules of marine origin has created an important bridge between biological knowledge and its applications in biotechnology and biomedicine. Current studies in different research fields, such as biomedicine, aim to discover marine molecules characterized by biological activities that can be used to produce potential drugs for human use. In recent decades, increasing attention has been paid to a particular group of marine invertebrates, the Ascidians, as they are a source of bioactive products. We describe omics data and computational methods relevant to identifying the mechanisms and processes of innate immunity underlying the biosynthesis of bioactive molecules, focusing on innovative computational approaches based on Artificial Intelligence. Since there is increasing attention on finding new solutions for a sustainable supply of bioactive compounds, we propose that a possible improvement in the biodiscovery pipeline might also come from the study and utilization of marine invertebrates' innate immunity.",

    "abstract": "The polymorphism of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) complicates diagnosis in health care services because lesions may be confused with other dermatoses such as sporotrichosis, paracocidiocomycosis, and venous insufficiency. Automated identification of skin diseases based on deep learning (DL) has been applied to assist diagnosis. In this study, we evaluated the performance of AlexNet, a DL algorithm, to identify pictures of CL lesions in patients from Midwest Brazil. We used a set of 2458 pictures (up to 10 of each lesion) obtained from patients treated between 2015 and 2022 in the Leishmaniasis Clinic at the University Hospital of Brasilia. We divided the picture database into training (80%), internal validation (10%), and testing sets (10%), and trained and tested AlexNet to identify pictures of CL lesions. We performed three simulations and trained AlexNet to differentiate CL from 26 other dermatoses (e.g., chromomycosis, ecthyma, venous insufficiency). We obtained an average accuracy of 95.04% (Confidence Interval 95%: 93.81-96.04), indicating an excellent performance of AlexNet in identifying pictures of CL lesions. We conclude that automated CL identification using AlexNet has the potential to assist clinicians in diagnosing skin lesions. These results contribute to the development of a mobile application to assist in the diagnosis of CL in health care services.",

    "abstract": "With the exponential advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the realm of medicine is experiencing a paradigm shift, engendering a multitude of prospects and trials for healthcare practitioners, encompassing those devoted to the practice of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). This study explores the evolving landscape for TCM practitioners in the AI era, emphasizing that while AI can be helpful, it cannot replace the role of TCM practitioners. It is paramount to underscore the intrinsic worth of human expertise, accentuating that artificial intelligence (AI) is merely an instrument. On the one hand, AI-enabled tools like intelligent symptom checkers, diagnostic assistance systems, and personalized treatment plans can augment TCM practitioners' expertise and capacity, improving diagnosis accuracy and treatment efficacy. AI-empowered collaborations between Western medicine and TCM can strengthen holistic care. On the other hand, AI may disrupt conventional TCM workflow and doctor-patient relationships. Maintaining the humanistic spirit of TCM while embracing AI requires upholding professional ethics and establishing appropriate regulations. To leverage AI while retaining the essence of TCM, practitioners need to hone holistic analytical skills and see AI as complementary. By highlighting promising applications and potential risks of AI in TCM, this study provides strategic insights for stakeholders to promote the integrated development of AI and TCM for better patient outcomes. With proper implementation, AI can become a valuable assistant for TCM practitioners to elevate healthcare quality.",

    "abstract": "In the domain of healthcare, most importantly pediatric healthcare, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted the medical field. Congenital heart diseases represent a group of heart diseases that are known to be some of the most critical cardiac conditions present at birth. These heart diseases need a swift diagnosis as well as an intervention to ensure the wellbeing of newborns. Fortunately, with the help of AI, including the highly advanced algorithms, analytics and imaging involved, it provides us with a promising era for neonatal care. This article reviewed published data in PubMed, Science Direct, UpToDate, and Google Scholar between the years 2015-2023. To conclude The use of artificial intelligence in detecting congenital heart diseases has shown great promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of AI-based approaches for diagnosing congenital heart diseases, with results indicating that the systems can achieve high levels of sensitivity and specificity. In addition, AI can help reduce the workload of healthcare professionals allowing them to focus on other critical aspects of patient care. Despite the potential benefits of using AI, in addition to detecting congenital heart disease, there are still some challenges to overcome, such as the need for large amounts of high-quality data and the requirement for careful validation of the algorithms. Nevertheless, with ongoing research and development, AI is likely to become an increasingly valuable tool for improving the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart diseases.",

    "abstract": "In the last years, several techniques of artificial intelligence have been applied to data from COVID-19. In addition to the symptoms related to COVID-19, many individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection have described various long-lasting symptoms, now termed Long COVID. In this context, artificial intelligence techniques have been utilized to analyze data from Long COVID patients in order to assist doctors and alleviate the considerable strain on care and rehabilitation facilities. In this paper, we explore the impact of the machine learning methodologies that have been applied to analyze the many aspects of Long COVID syndrome, from clinical presentation through diagnosis. We also include the text mining techniques used to extract insights and trends from large amounts of text data related to Long COVID. Finally, we critically compare the various approaches and outline the work that has to be done to create a robust artificial intelligence approach for efficient diagnosis and treatment of Long COVID.",

    "abstract": "Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite all available diagnostics and treatments, these conditions pose a significant individual, economic and social burden. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to support clinical decision-making processes by optimizing diagnosis and treatment strategies of these heterogeneous and complex chronic respiratory diseases. Its capabilities extend to predicting exacerbation risk, disease progression and mortality, providing healthcare professionals with valuable insights for more effective care. Nevertheless, the knowledge gap between respiratory clinicians and data scientists remains a major constraint for wide application of AI and may hinder future progress. This narrative review aims to bridge this gap and encourage AI deployment by explaining its methodology and added value in asthma and COPD diagnosis and treatment.\nThis review offers an overview of the fundamental concepts of AI and machine learning, outlines the key steps in building a model, provides examples of their applicability in asthma and COPD care, and discusses barriers to their implementation.\nMachine learning can advance our understanding of asthma and COPD, enabling personalized therapy and better outcomes. Further research and validation are needed to ensure the development of clinically meaningful and generalizable models.",

    "abstract": "Stem/progenitor cells have been widely evaluated as a promising therapeutic option for heart failure (HF). Numerous clinical trials with stem/progenitor cell-based therapy (SCT) for HF have demonstrated encouraging results, but not without limitations or discrepancies. Recent technological advancements in multiomics, bioinformatics, precision medicine, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) provide new approaches and insights for stem cell research and therapeutic development. Integration of these new technologies into stem/progenitor cell therapy for HF may help address: 1) the technical challenges to obtain reliable and high-quality therapeutic precursor cells, 2) the discrepancies between preclinical and clinical studies, and 3) the personalized selection of optimal therapeutic cell types/populations for individual patients in the context of precision medicine. This review summarizes the current status of SCT for HF in clinics and provides new perspectives on the development of computation-aided SCT in the era of precision medicine and AI/ML.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis remains a major challenge internationally for healthcare systems. Its incidence is rising due to poor public awareness and delays in its recognition and subsequent management. In sepsis, mortality increases with every hour left untreated. Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming worldwide healthcare delivery at present. This review has outlined how AI can augment strategies to address this global disease burden. AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms can analyze vast quantities of increasingly complex clinical datasets from electronic medical records to assist clinicians in diagnosing and treating sepsis earlier than traditional methods. Our review highlights how these models can predict the risk of sepsis and organ failure even before it occurs. This gives providers additional time to plan and execute treatment plans, thereby avoiding increasing complications associated with delayed diagnosis of sepsis. The potential for cost savings with AI implementation is also discussed, including improving workflow efficiencies, reducing administrative costs, and improving healthcare outcomes. Despite these advantages, clinicians have been slow to adopt AI into clinical practice. Some of the limitations posed by AI solutions include the lack of diverse data sets for model building so that they are widely applicable for routine clinical use. Furthermore, the subsequent algorithms are often based on complex mathematics leading to clinician hesitancy to embrace such technologies. Finally, we highlight the need for robust political and regulatory frameworks in this area to achieve the trust and approval of clinicians and patients to implement this transformational technology.",

    "abstract": "Moral reasoning is necessary to the nursing profession. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the mediating role of moral reasoning in spiritual intelligence and caring behaviors among Iranian emergency nurses. In this descriptive-analytical study structural equation modeling (SEM) is employed for the data analysis. the minimum required sample size determined by the number of parameters of the model was 18. Considering that 5 to 15 samples were required for each of the parameters; the required sample size was 272. Nurses working in the emergency department of all hospitals in Qom, Iran, were selected by convenience sampling. Demographic characteristics inventory, King's Spiritual Intelligence Self-Report Inventory, Crisham's Nursing Dilemma Test, and Wolf's Caring Behaviors Inventory used for data collection. SPSS (V20) and Mplus were used to analyze the data. The results showed that a significant direct relationship was observed between moral reasoning and caring behaviors. According to SEM results, direct and indirect effects were observed of spiritual intelligence on caring behavior It is therefore recommended managers and hospital officials pay meticulous attention to spiritual intelligence and the power of decision-making in nurses to improve their caring behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based genome editing (GED) technologies have unlocked exciting possibilities for understanding genes and improving medical treatments. On the other hand, Artificial intelligence (AI) helps genome editing achieve more precision, efficiency, and affordability in tackling various diseases, like Sickle cell anemia or Thalassemia. AI models have been in use for designing guide RNAs (gRNAs) for CRISPR-Cas systems. Tools like DeepCRISPR, CRISTA, and DeepHF have the capability to predict optimal guide RNAs (gRNAs) for a specified target sequence. These predictions take into account multiple factors, including genomic context, Cas protein type, desired mutation type, on-target/off-target scores, potential off-target sites, and the potential impacts of genome editing on gene function and cell phenotype. These models aid in optimizing different genome editing technologies, such as base, prime, and epigenome editing, which are advanced techniques to introduce precise and programmable changes to DNA sequences without relying on the homology-directed repair pathway or donor DNA templates. Furthermore, AI, in collaboration with genome editing and precision medicine, enables personalized treatments based on genetic profiles. AI analyzes patients' genomic data to identify mutations, variations, and biomarkers associated with different diseases like Cancer, Diabetes, Alzheimer's, etc. However, several challenges persist, including high costs, off-target editing, suitable delivery methods for CRISPR cargoes, improving editing efficiency, and ensuring safety in clinical applications. This review explores AI's contribution to improving CRISPR-based genome editing technologies and addresses existing challenges. It also discusses potential areas for future research in AI-driven CRISPR-based genome editing technologies. The integration of AI and genome editing opens up new possibilities for genetics, biomedicine, and healthcare, with significant implications for human health.",

    "abstract": "Skin cancer is one of the most common forms worldwide, with a significant increase in incidence over the last few decades. Early and accurate detection of this type of cancer can result in better prognoses and less invasive treatments for patients. With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), tools have emerged that can facilitate diagnosis and classify dermatological images, complementing traditional clinical assessments and being applicable where there is a shortage of specialists. Its adoption requires analysis of efficacy, safety, and ethical considerations, as well as considering the genetic and ethnic diversity of patients.\nThe systematic review aims to examine research on the detection, classification, and assessment of skin cancer images in clinical settings.\nWe conducted a systematic literature search on PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science, encompassing studies published until April 4th, 2023. Study selection, data extraction, and critical appraisal were carried out by two independent reviewers. Results were subsequently presented through a narrative synthesis.\nThrough the search, 760 studies were identified in four databases, from which only 18 studies were selected, focusing on developing, implementing, and validating systems to detect, diagnose, and classify skin cancer in clinical settings. This review covers descriptive analysis, data scenarios, data processing and techniques, study results and perspectives, and physician diversity, accessibility, and participation.\nThe application of artificial intelligence in dermatology has the potential to revolutionize early detection of skin cancer. However, it is imperative to validate and collaborate with healthcare professionals to ensure its clinical effectiveness and safety.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of humanistic care is conducive to providing high quality nursing, improving patient satisfaction and establishing harmonious nursery-patient relationship. Current researchs show that humanistic caring ability is affected by emotional intelligence, empathy, interpersonal communication. But the exact relationship and internal mechanism of such factors have not been fully understood.\nTo explore the multiple mediating effect of empathy and communication ability on nursing students' emotional intelligence and caring ability.\nA case study was conducted by examining a sample of 1,165 nursing students from a junior college in Anhui, China. The multidimensional scales, and a self-designed demographic characteristics questionnaire were utilized. Path relationships and mutual effects were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM).\nEmotional intelligence, empathy, and communication ability were found to positively affect nursing students' caring ability, as well as positive interrelationships with one another (standardized estimate\u2009=\u20090.312-0.584, \nThe chain mediating role of empathy and communication ability in emotional intelligence and caring ability is explored, which not only enrichis previous studies, but also reveals the mechanism of emotional intelligence's influence on caring ability.

    "abstract": "No-boundary thinking enables the scientific community to reflect in a thoughtful manner and discover new opportunities, create innovative solutions, and break through barriers that might have otherwise constrained their progress. This concept encourages thinking without being confined by traditional rules, limitations, or established norms, and a mindset that is not limited by previous work, leading to fresh perspectives and innovative outcomes. So, where do we see the field of artificial intelligence (AI) in bioinformatics going in the next 30\u00a0years? That was the theme of a \"No-Boundary Thinking\" Session as part of the Mid-South Computational Bioinformatics Society's (MCBIOS) 19th annual meeting in Irving, Texas. This session addressed various areas of AI in an open discussion and raised some perspectives on how popular tools like ChatGPT can be integrated into bioinformatics, communicating with scientists in different fields to properly utilize the potential of these algorithms, and how to continue educational outreach to further interest of data science and informatics to the next-generation of scientists.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) poses a significant threat as the third leading cause of cardiovascular death, prompting the widespread use of CT pulmonary angiogram for rapid detection. Despite its prevalence, diagnostic accuracy remains variable among radiologists. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), notably through convolutional neural networks and deep learning reconstruction, offers a promising avenue to enhance PE detection. AI demonstrates superior sensitivity and negative predictive values, reducing the risk of missed diagnoses. Implementation of AI-based worklist prioritization substantially shortens detection and notification times, streamlining radiological workflows. However, it is crucial to underscore that AI acts as a complement, not a replacement, for radiologists, synergizing with human expertise. As AI integration progresses, it holds the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in pulmonary embolism detection while maintaining the essential role of human judgment in medical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized medical care in recent years and plays a vital role in a number of areas, such as diagnostics and forecasting. In this review, we discuss the most promising areas of AI application to the field of bone tissue engineering and prosthetics, which can drastically benefit from AI-assisted optimization and patient personalization of implants and scaffolds in ways ranging from visualization and real-time monitoring to the implantation cases prediction, thereby leveraging the compromise between specific architecture decisions, material choice, and synthesis procedure. With the emphasized crucial role of accuracy and robustness of developed AI algorithms, especially in bone tissue engineering, it was shown that rigorous validation and testing, demanding large datasets and extensive clinical trials, are essential, and we discuss how through developing multidisciplinary cooperation among biology, chemistry with materials science, and AI, these challenges can be addressed.",

    "abstract": "Our study aimed to assess the role of a hand-held fundus camera and artificial intelligence (AI)-based grading system in diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening and determine its diagnostic accuracy in detecting DR compared with clinical examination and a standard fundus camera. This cross-sectional instrument validation study, as a part of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Project, included 160 patients (320 eyes) with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). After the standard indirect slit-lamp fundoscopy, each patient first underwent fundus photography with a standard 45\u00b0 camera VISUCAM Zeiss and then with a hand-held camera TANG (Shanghai Zhi Tang Health Technology Co., Ltd.). Two retina specialists independently graded the images taken with the standard camera, while the images taken with the hand-held camera were graded using the DeepDR system and an independent IDF ophthalmologist. The three screening methods did not differ in detecting moderate/severe nonproliferative and proliferative DR. The area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, kappa (\u0138) agreement, diagnostic odds ratio, and diagnostic effectiveness for a hand-held camera compared to clinical examination were 0.921, 89.1%, 100%, 100%, 91.4%, infinity, 0.11, 0.86, 936.48, and 94.9%, while compared to the standard fundus camera were 0.883, 83.2%, 100%, 100%, 87.3%, infinity, 0.17, 0.78, 574.6, and 92.2%. The results of our study suggest that fundus photography with a hand-held camera and AI-based grading system is a short, simple, and accurate method for the screening and early detection of DR, comparable to clinical examination and fundus photography with a standard camera.",

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex, systemic autoimmune disease characterised by immune dysregulation. Pathogenesis is multifactorial, contributing to clinical heterogeneity and posing challenges for diagnosis and treatment. Although strides in treatment options have been made in the past 15 years, with the US Food and Drug Administration approval of belimumab in 2011, there are still many patients who have inadequate responses to therapy. A better understanding of underlying disease mechanisms with a holistic and multiparametric approach is required to improve clinical assessment and treatment. This Review discusses the evolution of genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics in the study of systemic lupus erythematosus and ways to amalgamate these silos of data with a systems-based approach while also discussing ways to strengthen the overall process. These mechanistic insights will facilitate the discovery of functionally relevant biomarkers to guide rational therapeutic selection to improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. An objective diagnosis method is urgently needed in clinical practice. In this study, deep learning and radiomics techniques were studied to automatically diagnose PD from healthy controls (HCs).\n155 PD patients and 154 HCs were randomly divided into a training set (246 patients) and a testing set (63 patients). The brain subregions identification and segmentation were automatically performed with a VB-net, and radiomics features of billateral thalamus, caudatum, putamen and pallidum were extracted. Five independent machine learning classifiers [Support Vector Machine (SVM), Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), random forest (RF), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and decision tree (DT)] were trained on the training set, and validated on the testing. Delong test was used to compare the performance of different models.\nOur VB-net could automatically identify and segment the brain into 109 regions. 2,264 radiomics features were automatically extracted from the billateral thalamus, caudatum, putamen or pallidum of each patient. After four step of features dimensionality reduction, Delong tests showed that the SVM model based on combined features had the best performance, with AUCs of 0.988 (95% CI: 0.979\u2009~\u20090.998, specificity\u2009=\u200991.1%, sensitivity =100%, accuracy\u2009=\u200989.4% and precision\u2009=\u200988.2%) and 0.976 (95% CI: 0.942\u2009~\u20091.000, specificity\u2009=\u2009100%, sensitivity\u2009=\u200987.1%, accuracy\u2009=\u200993.5% and precision\u2009=\u200988.6%) in the training set and testing set, respectively. Decision curve analysis showed that the clinical benefit of the line graph model was high.\nThe SVM model based on combined features could be used to diagnose PD with high accuracy. Our fully automatic model could rapidly process the MRI data and distinguish PD and HCs in one minute. It greatly improved the diagnostic efficiency and has a great potential value in clinical practice to help the early diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Patients with facial trauma may suffer from injuries such as broken bones, bleeding, swelling, bruising, lacerations, burns, and deformity in the face. Common causes of facial-bone fractures are the results of road accidents, violence, and sports injuries. Surgery is needed if the trauma patient would be deprived of normal functioning or subject to facial deformity based on findings from radiology. Although the image reading by radiologists is useful for evaluating suspected facial fractures, there are certain challenges in human-based diagnostics. Artificial intelligence (AI) is making a quantum leap in radiology, producing significant improvements of reports and workflows. Here, an updated literature review is presented on the impact of AI in facial trauma with a special reference to fracture detection in radiology. The purpose is to gain insights into the current development and demand for future research in facial trauma. This review also discusses limitations to be overcome and current important issues for investigation in order to make AI applications to the trauma more effective and realistic in practical settings. The publications selected for review were based on their clinical significance, journal metrics, and journal indexing.",

    "abstract": "As the field of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to progress, the use of AI-powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT, in higher education settings has gained significant attention. This paper addresses a well-defined problem pertaining to the critical need for a comprehensive examination of students' ChatGPT adoption in higher education. To examine such adoption, it is imperative to focus on measuring actual user behavior. While measuring students' ChatGPT usage behavior at a specific point in time can be valuable, a more holistic approach is necessary to understand the temporal dynamics of AI adoption. To address this need, a longitudinal survey was conducted, examining how students' ChatGPT usage behavior changes over time among students, and unveiling the drivers of such behavior change. The empirical examination of 222 Dutch higher education students revealed a significant decline in students' ChatGPT usage behavior over an 8 month period. This period was defined by two distinct data collection phases: the initial phase (T1) and a follow-up phase conducted 8 months later (T2). Furthermore, the results demonstrate that changes in trust, emotional creepiness, and Perceived Behavioral Control significantly predicted the observed change in usage behavior. The findings of this research carry significant academic and managerial implications, as they advance our comprehension of the temporal aspects of AI adoption in higher education. The findings also provide actionable guidance for AI developers and educational institutions seeking to optimize student engagement with AI technologies.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, deep learning (DL) has contributed a paradigm shift in computer vision and image recognition creating widespread opportunities of using artificial intelligence in research as well as industrial applications. DL has been extensively studied in medical imaging applications, including those related to pulmonary diseases. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, lung cancer, pneumonia, and, more recently, COVID-19 are common lung diseases affecting nearly 7.4% of world population. Pulmonary imaging has been widely investigated toward improving our understanding of disease etiologies and early diagnosis and assessment of disease progression and clinical outcomes. DL has been broadly applied to solve various pulmonary image processing challenges including classification, recognition, registration, and segmentation. This paper presents a survey of pulmonary diseases, roles of imaging in translational and clinical pulmonary research, and applications of different DL architectures and methods in pulmonary imaging with emphasis on DL-based segmentation of major pulmonary anatomies such as lung volumes, lung lobes, pulmonary vessels, and airways as well as thoracic musculoskeletal anatomies related to pulmonary diseases.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric acquired brain injury (pABI) profoundly affects cognitive functions, encompassing IQ and executive functions (EFs). Particularly, young age at insult may lead to persistent and debilitating deficits, affecting daily-life functioning negatively. This study delves into the intricate interplay of age at insult, time post-insult, and their associations with IQ and EFs during chronic (>1\u2009year) pABI. Additionally, we investigate cognitive performance across different levels of global function, recognizing the multifaceted nature of developmental factors influencing outcomes.\nDrawing upon insult data and baseline information analyzing secondary outcomes from a multicenter RCT, including comprehensive medical and neuropsychological assessments of participants aged 10 to 17\u2009years with pABI and parent-reported executive dysfunctions. The study examined associations between age at insult (early, EI; \u22647y vs. late, LI; > 7y) and time post-insult with IQ and EFs (updating, shifting, inhibition, and executive attention). Additionally, utilizing the Pediatric Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended, we explored cognitive performance across levels of global functioning.\nSeventy-six participants, median 8\u2009years at insult and 5\u2009years post-insult, predominantly exhibiting moderate disability (\nEarly insults and prolonged post-insult durations impose lasting tribulations in chronic pABI. While confirmation through larger studies is needed, these findings carry clinical implications, underscoring the importance of vigilance regarding early insults. Moreover, they dispel the notion that children fully recover from pABI; instead, they advocate equitable rehabilitation offerings for pABI, tailored to address cognitive functions, recognizing their pivotal role in achieving independence and participation in society. Incorporating disability screening in long-term follow-up assessments may prove beneficial.",

    "abstract": "As one of the largest contributors of morbidity and mortality, psychiatric disorders are anticipated to triple in prevalence over the coming decade or so. Major obstacles to psychiatric care include stigma, funding constraints, and a dearth of resources and psychiatrists. The main thrust of our present-day discussion has been towards the direction of how machine learning and artificial intelligence could influence the way that patients experience care. To better grasp the issues regarding trust, privacy, and autonomy, their societal and ethical ramifications need to be probed. There is always the possibility that the artificial mind could malfunction or exhibit behavioral abnormalities. An in-depth philosophical understanding of these possibilities in both human and artificial intelligence could offer correlational insights into the robotic management of mental disorders in the future. This article looks into the role of artificial intelligence, the different challenges associated with it, as well as the perspectives in the management of such mental illnesses as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in breast imaging span a wide range of tasks including decision support, risk assessment, patient management, quality assessment, treatment response assessment and image enhancement. However, their integration into the clinical workflow has been slow due to the lack of a consensus on data quality, benchmarked robust implementation, and consensus-based guidelines to ensure standardization and generalization. Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) has improved sensitivity and specificity compared to current standards of breast cancer diagnostic imaging i.e., mammography (MG) and/or conventional ultrasound (US), with comparable accuracy to MRI (current diagnostic imaging benchmark), but at a much lower cost and higher throughput. This makes CEM an excellent tool for widespread breast lesion characterization for all women, including underserved and minority women. Underlining the critical need for early detection and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer, this review examines the limitations of conventional approaches and reveals how AI can help overcome them. The Methodical approaches, such as image processing, feature extraction, quantitative analysis, lesion classification, lesion segmentation, integration with clinical data, early detection, and screening support have been carefully analysed in recent studies addressing breast cancer detection and diagnosis. Recent guidelines described by Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM) to establish a robust framework for rigorous evaluation and surveying has inspired the current review criteria.",

    "abstract": "A growing amount of research is being conducted on cultural intelligence (CQ), which is the ability to adjust and adapt successfully to a variety of surroundings. CQ is a vital quality for people in diversified societies, as are seen today. However, it is still unclear how an individual can develop or strengthen CQ because previous studies have shown that variables such as foreign experience and personality are not exclusively sufficient as CQ antecedents. If CQ can be treated health-scientifically, as the CQ developers argue, diet and exercise that are effective in keeping the body and brain healthy may also correlate with CQ. It is of great significance to clarify the relationship between lifestyle and CQ by applying recent previous research showing the relationship between CQ and both the brain and intelligence, as well as between lifestyle and both the brain and intelligence. Using data derived from 142 Japanese businesspersons, the results of structural equation modeling indicate that lifestyles (dietary balance and walking frequency) are significantly associated with CQ after controlling for personalities (curiosity and grit) and international experiences (length of studying and working abroad), which have been used as predictors of CQ in previous studies. Furthermore, the moderation test showed that the effect of dietary balance on increasing CQ is greater for people with less overseas experience, indicating that dietary balance compensates for lack of overseas experience in the effect of maintaining the level of CQ. These suggest the effectiveness of a health-scientific approach to the influencing factors of CQ. This study is the first to show that CQ is influenced by lifestyle such as walking and dieting, in addition to personality and overseas experience, and will contribute to the future development of health science and cross-cultural research.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is efficient for the diagnosis of preoperative uterine sarcoma; however, misdiagnoses may occur. In this study, we developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) system to overcome the limitations of requiring specialists to manually process datasets and a large amount of computer resources.\nThe AI system comprises a tumor image filter, which extracts MRI slices containing tumors, and sarcoma evaluator, which diagnoses uterine sarcomas. We used 15 types of MRI patient sequences to train deep neural network (DNN) models used by tumor filter and sarcoma evaluator with 8 cross-validation sets. We implemented tumor filter and sarcoma evaluator using ensemble prediction technique with 9 DNN models. Ten tumor filters and sarcoma evaluator sets were developed to evaluate fluctuation accuracy. Finally, AutoDiag-AI was used to evaluate the new validation dataset, including 8 cases of sarcomas and 24 leiomyomas.\nTumor image filter and sarcoma evaluator accuracies were 92.68% and 90.50%, respectively. AutoDiag-AI with the original dataset accuracy was 89.32%, with 90.47% sensitivity and 88.95% specificity, whereas AutoDiag-AI with the new validation dataset accuracy was 92.44%, with 92.25% sensitivity and 92.50% specificity.\nOur newly established AI system automatically extracts tumor sites from MRI images and diagnoses them as uterine sarcomas without human intervention. Its accuracy is comparable to that of a radiologist. With further validation, the system could be applied for diagnosis of other diseases. Further improvement of the system's accuracy may enable its clinical application in the future.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies embody countless solutions in radiation oncology, yet translation of AI-assisted software tools to actual clinical environments remains unrealized. We present the Deep Learning On-Demand Assistant (DL-ODA), a fully automated, end-to-end clinical platform that enables AI interventions for any disease site featuring an automated model-training pipeline, auto-segmentations, and QA reporting.\nWe developed, tested, and prospectively deployed the DL-ODA system at a large university affiliated hospital center. Medical professionals activate the DL-ODA via two pathways (1): On-Demand, used for immediate AI decision support for a patient-specific treatment plan, and (2) Ambient, in which QA is provided for all daily radiotherapy (RT) plans by comparing DL segmentations with manual delineations and calculating the dosimetric impact. To demonstrate the implementation of a new anatomy segmentation, we used the model-training pipeline to generate a breast segmentation model based on a large clinical dataset. Additionally, the contour QA functionality of existing models was assessed using a retrospective cohort of 3,399 lung and 885 spine RT cases. Ambient QA was performed for various disease sites including spine RT and heart for dosimetric sparing.\nSuccessful training of the breast model was completed in less than a day and resulted in clinically viable whole breast contours. For the retrospective analysis, we evaluated manual-versus-AI similarity for the ten most common structures. The DL-ODA detected high similarities in heart, lung, liver, and kidney delineations but lower for esophagus, trachea, stomach, and small bowel due largely to incomplete manual contouring. The deployed Ambient QAs for heart and spine sites have prospectively processed over 2,500 cases and 230 cases over 9 months and 5 months, respectively, automatically alerting the RT personnel.\nThe DL-ODA capabilities in providing universal AI interventions were demonstrated for On-Demand contour QA, DL segmentations, and automated model training, and confirmed successful integration of the system into a large academic radiotherapy department. The novelty of deploying the DL-ODA as a multi-modal, fully automated end-to-end AI clinical implementation solution marks a significant step towards a generalizable framework that leverages AI to improve the efficiency and reliability of RT systems.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Intelligence quotient (IQ) is an indicator to measure a child's cognitive ability to learn or understand and to deal with new situations with their logical and analytical skills. Children with better IQ exhibit increased cooperation when undergoing dental treatments, leading to a positive attitude toward dental care. The primary aim of the study was to assess the interrelationship between the IQ of children, space maintainer therapy, and the behavior of children aged 6-10 years. Materials and methods A total of 104 children were divided into two groups: group 1 included children undergoing space maintainer therapy and group 2 included children who did not undergo space maintainer therapy. Their IQ scores were assessed using Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices and behavior and the Frankl behavior rating scale. The data were analyzed by SPSS Version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Independent t-tests were used to evaluate the differences between IQ and children with space maintainers, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess the differences between behavior and space maintainers. Results The mean age of the participants was approximately 8.28 years. The mean IQ score of the group of children undergoing the space maintainer therapy was 90.69 \u00b1 7.65 and that of the control group was 105.59\u00b110.71. Based on the Frankl behavior rating scale, the mean score in the space maintainer group was 35.44 and that of the control group was 69.56. There was a significant association between IQ, behavior, and the presence of space maintainers. Conclusion The group of children undergoing space maintainer therapy demonstrated comparatively lesser IQ, and the majority of children exhibited negative behavior. Also, children wearing space maintainers had undergone one or multiple extractions, which is traumatic for children and may lead to them likely exhibiting a negative behavior than children in the control group. Hence, it may be concluded that intelligence, behavior, and space maintainers are all significantly associated with each other.",

    "abstract": "The last decade has led to rapid developments and increased usage of computational tools at the single-cell level. However, our knowledge remains limited in how extracellular cues alter quantitative macrophage morphology and how such morphological changes can be used to predict macrophage phenotype as well as cytokine content at the single-cell level.\nUsing an artificial intelligence (AI) based approach, this study determined whether (i) accurate macrophage classification and (ii) prediction of intracellular IL-10 at the single-cell level was possible, using only morphological features as predictors for AI. Using a quantitative panel of shape descriptors, our study assessed image-based original and synthetic single-cell data in two different datasets in which CD14+ monocyte-derived macrophages generated from human peripheral blood monocytes were initially primed with GM-CSF or M-CSF followed by polarization with specific stimuli in the presence/absence of continuous GM-CSF or M-CSF. Specifically, M0, M1 (GM-CSF-M1, TNF\u03b1/IFN\u03b3-M1, GM-CSF/TNF\u03b1/IFN\u03b3-M1) and M2 (M-CSF-M2, IL-4-M2a, M-CSF/IL-4-M2a, IL-10-M2c, M-CSF/IL-10-M2c) macrophages were examined.\nPhenotypes were confirmed by ELISA and immunostaining of CD markers. Variations of polarization techniques significantly changed multiple macrophage morphological features, demonstrating that macrophage morphology is a highly sensitive, dynamic marker of phenotype. Using original and synthetic single-cell data, cell morphology alone yielded an accuracy of 93% for the classification of 6 different human macrophage phenotypes (with continuous GM-CSF or M-CSF). A similarly high phenotype classification accuracy of 95% was reached with data generated with different stimuli (discontinuous GM-CSF or M-CSF) and measured at a different time point. These comparably high accuracies clearly validated the here chosen AI-based approach. Quantitative morphology also allowed prediction of intracellular IL-10 with 95% accuracy using only original data.\nThus, image-based machine learning using morphology-based features not only (i) classified M0, M1 and M2 macrophages but also (ii) classified M2a and M2c subtypes and (iii) predicted intracellular IL-10 at the single-cell level among six phenotypes. This simple approach can be used as a general strategy not only for macrophage phenotyping but also for prediction of IL-10 content of any IL-10 producing cell, which can help improve our understanding of cytokine biology at the single-cell level.",

    "abstract": "Social media dominate today's information ecosystem and provide valuable information for social research. Market researchers, social scientists, policymakers, government entities, public health researchers, and practitioners recognize the potential for social data to inspire innovation, support products and services, characterize public opinion, and guide decisions. The appeal of mining these rich datasets is clear. However, there is potential risk of data misuse, underscoring an equally huge and fundamental flaw in the research: there are no procedural standards and little transparency. Transparency across the processes of collecting and analyzing social media data is often limited due to proprietary algorithms. Spurious findings and biases introduced by artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrate the challenges this lack of transparency poses for research. Social media research remains a virtual \"wild west,\" with no clear standards for reporting regarding data retrieval, preprocessing steps, analytic methods, or interpretation. Use of emerging generative AI technologies to augment social media analytics can undermine validity and replicability of findings, potentially turning this research into a \"black box\" enterprise. Clear guidance for social media analyses and reporting is needed to assure the quality of the resulting research. In this article, we propose criteria for evaluating the quality of studies using social media data, grounded in established scientific practice. We offer clear documentation guidelines to ensure that social data are used properly and transparently in research and applications. A checklist of disclosure elements to meet minimal reporting standards is proposed. These criteria will make it possible for scholars and practitioners to assess the quality, credibility, and comparability of research findings using digital data.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) since it was introduced into dentistry, has become an important and valuable tool in many fields. It was applied in different specialties with different uses, for example, in diagnosis of oral cancer, periodontal disease and dental caries, and in the treatment planning and predicting the outcome of orthognathic surgeries. The aim of this comprehensive review is to report on the application and performance of AI models designed for application in the field of endodontics.\nPubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched to collect the most relevant articles using terms, such as AI, endodontics, and dentistry. This review included 56 papers related to AI and its application in endodontics.\nThe applications of AI were in detecting and diagnosing periapical lesions, assessing root fractures, working length determination, prediction for postoperative pain, studying root canal anatomy and decision-making in endodontics for retreatment. The accuracy of AI in performing these tasks can reach up to 90%.\nArtificial intelligence has valuable applications in the field of modern endodontics with promising results. Larger and multicenter data sets can give external validity to the AI models.\nIn the field of dentistry, AI models are specifically crafted to contribute to the diagnosis of oral diseases, ranging from common issues such as dental caries to more complex conditions like periodontal diseases and oral cancer. AI models can help in diagnosis, treatment planning, and in patient management in endodontics. Along with the modern tools like cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), AI can be a valuable aid to the clinician. How to cite this article: Ahmed ZH, Almuharib AM, Abdulkarim AA, ",

    "abstract": "The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medical science is growing immensely. Since AI contains features that can address both preventive and therapeutic aspects of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), it can potentially lessen the massive burden of morbidity and mortality associated with NCDs. AI can help in various ways in NCDs including predicting disease occurrence, monitoring, ensuring treatment and follow-up of patients. Low- and middle-income countries can harness the benefit of AI for the management of chronic diseases and effectively address challenges like manpower shortage, accessibility to health care, etc. However, AI needs to be used responsibly and rationally in NCDs for its maximum benefit.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative dementia syndromes, such as Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), have traditionally been diagnosed based in part on verbal and nonverbal cognitive profiles. Debate continues about whether PPA is best subdivided into three variants and also regarding the most distinctive linguistic features for classifying PPA variants. In this study, we harnessed the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to first perform unsupervised classification of concise, connected speech samples from 78 PPA patients. Large Language Models discerned three distinct PPA clusters, with 88.5% agreement with independent clinical diagnoses. Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Seventeen features emerged as most valuable for this purpose, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of brief connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in predicting PPA subtypes and healthy controls. Our findings provide pivotal insights for refining early-stage dementia diagnosis, deepening our understanding of the characteristics of these neurodegenerative phenotypes and the neurobiology of language processing, and enhancing diagnostic evaluation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Certain features are helpful in the identification of gunshot entrance and exit wounds, such as the presence of muzzle imprints, peripheral tears, stippling, bone beveling, and wound border irregularity. Some cases are less straightforward and wounds can thus pose challenges to an emergency room doctor or forensic pathologist. In recent years, deep learning has shown promise in various automated medical image classification tasks. This study explores the feasibility of using a deep learning model to classify entry and exit gunshot wounds in digital color images. A collection of 2418 images of entrance and exit gunshot wounds were procured. Of these, 2028 entrance and 1314 exit wounds were cropped, focusing on the area around each gunshot wound. A ConvNext Tiny deep learning model was trained using the Fastai deep learning library, with a train/validation split ratio of 70/30, until a maximum validation accuracy of 92.6% was achieved. An additional 415 entrance and 293 exit wound images were collected for the test (holdout) set. The model achieved an accuracy of 87.99%, precision of 83.99%, recall of 87.71%, and F1-score 85.81% on the holdout set. Correctly classified were 88.19% of entrance wounds and 87.71% of exit wounds. The results are comparable to what a forensic pathologist can achieve without other morphologic cues. This study represents one of the first applications of artificial intelligence to the field of forensic pathology. This work demonstrates that deep learning models can discern entrance and exit gunshot wounds in digital images with high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The concept of evidence-based practice has persisted over several years and remains a cornerstone in clinical practice, representing the gold standard for optimal patient care. However, despite widespread recognition of its significance, practical application faces various challenges and barriers, including a lack of skills in interpreting studies, limited resources, time constraints, linguistic competencies, and more. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of a groundbreaking technological revolution known as artificial intelligence. Although artificial intelligence has become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, some reluctance persists among certain segments of the public. This article explores the potential of artificial intelligence as a solution to some of the main barriers encountered in the application of evidence-based practice. It highlights how artificial intelligence can assist in staying updated with the latest evidence, enhancing clinical decision-making, addressing patient misinformation, and mitigating time constraints in clinical practice. The integration of artificial intelligence into evidence-based practice has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, leading to more precise diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and improved doctor-patient interactions. This proposed synergy between evidence-based practice and artificial intelligence may necessitate adjustments to its core concept, heralding a new era in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "The quantified measurement and comprehensive analysis of artificial intelligence development (AIDEV) are vital for countries to form AI industrial ecology and promote the long-term development of regional AI technology. Based on the innovation ecosystems (IE) theory, this paper constructs an evaluation system to measure and analyze the spatiotemporal distribution and dynamic evolution of the AIDEV in China from 2011 to 2020. The results show that the AIDEV of China presents an overall upward trend and an obvious unbalance in the spatial distribution which is \"eastern\u00a0>\u00a0central\u00a0>\u00a0western\". Meanwhile, the provinces of low-level AIDEV are catching up with the high-level provinces, which leads to the regional difference of AIDEV narrowing. Moreover, the concentration and polarization phenomenon of AIDEV in China has been weakening and the AIDEV will continue to increase in the next three years. Further, there is a significantly positive spatial autocorrelation of AIDEV. Finally, high AIDEV provinces will increase the probability of surrounding provinces' AIDEV to develop. This paper expands the research stream in the field of AI research, extends the application scenarios of IE theory, and puts forward some relevant policy recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Ravens and other corvids are renowned for their 'intelligence'. For long, this reputation has been based primarily on anecdotes but in the last decades experimental evidence for impressive cognitive skills has accumulated within and across species. While we begin to understand the building blocks of corvid cognition, the question remains why these birds have evolved such skills. Focusing on Northern Ravens \nRaben und ihre Verwandtschaft gelten gemeinhin als \u201ekluge\u201c V\u00f6gel. Lange beruhte ihr Ruf weitgehend auf Anekdoten, erst in den letzten Jahrzehnten wurden ihre beeindruckenden kognitiven F\u00e4higkeiten auch in Verhaltensexperimenten nachgewiesen. W\u00e4hrend wir immer besser die kognitiven Bausteine von \u201eRaben-Intelligenz\u201c verstehen, bleibt die Frage offen, warum diese V\u00f6gel derartig leistungsstarke Gehirne entwickelt haben. In diesem Artikel gehe ich dieser Frage an Kolkraben ",

    "abstract": "Nuclear medicine and molecular imaging plays a significant role in the detection and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD). With recent advancements in computer power and the availability of digital archives, artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly gaining traction in the field of medical imaging, including nuclear medicine and molecular imaging. However, the complex and time-consuming workflow and interpretation involved in nuclear medicine and molecular imaging, limit their extensive utilization in clinical practice. To address this challenge, AI has emerged as a fundamental tool for enhancing the role of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging. It has shown promising applications in various crucial aspects of nuclear cardiology, such as optimizing imaging protocols, facilitating data processing, aiding in CVD diagnosis, risk classification and prognosis. In this review paper, we will introduce the key concepts of AI and provide an overview of its current progress in the field of nuclear cardiology. In addition, we will discuss future perspectives for AI in this domain.",

    "abstract": "In pursuit of applying universal non-biased Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, it is essential that data from different geographies are represented.\nTo assess the diagnostic performance of an AI-powered dermatological algorithm called Skin Image Search on Fitzpatrick 6 skin type (dark skin) dermatological conditions.\n123 dermatological images selected from a total of 173 images were retrospectively extracted from the electronic database of a Ugandan telehealth company, The Medical Concierge Group (TMCG) after getting their consent. Details of age, gender, and dermatological clinical diagnosis were analysed using R on R studio software to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the AI app along with disease diagnosis and body part. Predictability levels of the AI app were graded on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0- no prediction was made and 1-5 demonstrated a reduction incorrect diagnosis prediction rate of the AI.\n76 (62%) of the dermatological images were from females and 47 (38%) from males. Overall diagnostic accuracy of the AI app on black dermatological conditions was low at 17% (21 out of 123 predictable images) compared to 69.9% performance on Caucasian skin type as reported from the training results. There were varying predictability levels correctness i.e., 1-8.9%, 2-2.4%, 3-2.4%, 4-1.6%, 5-1.6% with performance along individual diagnosis highest with dermatitis (80%).\nThere is need for diversity of image datasets used to train dermatology algorithms for AI applications to increase accuracy across skin types and geographies.",

    "abstract": "Outdoor air pollution has been found to have a significant adverse effect on health. When the authors attempted to monitor air quality that cyclists or e-scooter users' breath during commuting in different locations for health and safety analysis, it was found that the existence of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars has a significant effect on the pollution levels and the monitoring process. To comprehensively study the effect of cars and traffic on air quality that cyclists and e-scooters users experience, a low-cost and reliable system was needed to detect the proximity of cars that have diesel or petrol engines. Video cameras can be used to visually detect vehicles, but in the modern age with the existence of many electric and hybrid vehicles and the need to reduce the cost of instrumentation, there was a need to determine the passing of vehicles near e-scooter and bike users from the combined engine and tires sounds. To address this issue, this study suggests a novel approach of using sound waves of internal combustion engines and tire sounds during the passing of cars, combined with AI techniques (neural networks), to detect the proximity of cars from cyclists and e-scooter users. Audio-visual data was collected using Go-Pro cameras in order to combine the data with GPS location and pollution levels. Geographical data maps were produced to demonstrate the density of cars that cyclists encounter when on or near the road. This method will enable air quality monitoring research to detect the existence of ICE cars for future correlation with measured pollution levels. The proposed method allows for:\u2022The automated selection of sensitive features from sound waves to detect vehicles.\u2022Low-cost hardware which is independent of orientation that can be integrated with other air quality and GPS sensors.\u2022The successful application of sensor fusion and neural networks.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of patients with suspected clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) are undergoing prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). The role of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in interpreting prostate mpMRI needs to be tested with multicenter external data. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic efficacy of an AI model in detecting and localizing visible csPCa on mpMRI a multicenter external data set.\nThe data of 2,105 patients suspected of having prostate cancer from four hospitals were retrospectively collected to develop an AI model to detect and localize suspicious csPCa. The lesions were annotated based on pathology records by two radiologists. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were used as the input for the three-dimensional U-Net framework. Subsequently, the model was validated using an external data set comprising the data of 557 patients from three hospitals. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were employed to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the model.\nAt the lesion level, the model had a sensitivity of 0.654. At the overall sextant level, the model had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.846, 0.884, and 0.874, respectively. At the patient level, the model had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.943, 0.776, and 0.849, respectively. The AI-predicted accuracy for the csPCa patients (231/245, 0.943) was significantly higher than that for the non-csPCa patients (242/312, 0.776) (P<0.001). The lesion number and tumor volume were greater in the correctly diagnosed patients than the incorrectly diagnosed patients (both P<0.001). Among the positive patients, those with lower average ADC values had a higher rate of correct diagnosis than those with higher average ADC values (P=0.01).\nThe AI model exhibited acceptable accuracy in detecting and localizing visible csPCa at the patient and sextant levels. However, further improvements need to be made to enhance the sensitivity of the model at the lesion level.",

    "abstract": "Pneumonia can be anatomically classified into lobar, lobular, and interstitial types, with each type associated with different pathogens. Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to determine the anatomical classifications of pneumonia and assist in refining the differential diagnosis may offer a more viable and clinically relevant solution. This study aimed to develop a multi-classification model capable of identifying the occurrence of pneumonia in patients by utilizing case-specific computed tomography (CT) information, categorizing the pneumonia type (lobar, lobular, and interstitial pneumonia), and performing segmentation of the associated lesions.\nA total of 61 lobar pneumonia patients, 60 lobular pneumonia patients, and 60 interstitial pneumonia patients were consecutively enrolled at our local hospital from June 2020 and May 2022. All selected cases were divided into a training cohort (n=135) and an independent testing cohort (n=46). To generate the ground truth labels for the training process, manual segmentation and labeling were performed by three junior radiologists. Subsequently, the segmentations were manually reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist. AI models were developed to automatically segment the infected lung regions and classify the pneumonia. The accuracy of pneumonia lesion segmentation was analyzed and evaluated using the Dice coefficient. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to assess the efficacy of pneumonia classification.\nOur AI model achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.743 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.657-0.826] for lesion segmentation in the training set and 0.723 (95% CI: 0.602-0.845) in the test set. In the test set, our model achieved an accuracy of 0.927 (95% CI: 0.876-0.978), precision of 0.889 (95% CI: 0.827-0.951), sensitivity of 0.889 (95% CI: 0.827-0.951), specificity of 0.946 (95% CI: 0.902-0.990), and AUC of 0.989 (95% CI: 0.969-1.000) for pneumonia classification. We trained the model using labels annotated by senior physicians and compared it to a model trained using labels annotated by junior physicians. The Dice coefficient of the model's segmentation improved by 0.014, increasing from 0.709 (95% CI: 0.589-0.830) to 0.723 (95% CI: 0.602-0.845), and the AUC improved by 0.042, rising from 0.947 to 0.989.\nOur study presents a robust multi-task learning model with substantial promise in enhancing the segmentation and classification of pneumonia in medical imaging.",

    "abstract": "In 2020, our center established a Tanner-Whitehouse 3 (TW3) artificial intelligence (AI) system using a convolutional neural network (CNN), which was built upon 9059 radiographs. However, the system, upon which our study is based, lacked a gold standard for comparison and had not undergone thorough evaluation in different working environments.\nTo further verify the applicability of the AI system in clinical bone age assessment (BAA) and to enhance the accuracy and homogeneity of BAA, a prospective multi-center validation was conducted. This study utilized 744 left-hand radiographs of patients, ranging from 1 to 20 years of age, with 378 boys and 366 girls. These radiographs were obtained from nine different children's hospitals between August and December 2020. The BAAs were performed using the TW3 AI system and were also reviewed by experienced reviewers. Bone age accuracy within 1 year, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) were statistically calculated to evaluate the accuracy. Kappa test and Bland-Altman (B-A) plot were conducted to measure the diagnostic consistency.\nThe system exhibited a high level of performance, producing results that closely aligned with those of the reviewers. It achieved a RMSE of 0.52 years and an accuracy of 94.55% for the radius, ulna, and short bones series. When assessing the carpal series of bones, the system achieved a RMSE of 0.85 years and an accuracy of 80.38%. Overall, the system displayed satisfactory accuracy and RMSE, particularly in patients over 7 years old. The system excelled in evaluating the carpal bone age of patients aged 1-6. Both the Kappa test and B-A plot demonstrated substantial consistency between the system and the reviewers, although the model encountered challenges in consistently distinguishing specific bones, such as the capitate. Furthermore, the system's performance proved acceptable across different genders and age groups, as well as radiography instruments.\nIn this multi-center validation, the system showcased its potential to enhance the efficiency and consistency of healthy delivery, ultimately resulting in improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.",

    "abstract": "Fatty liver disease, also known as hepatic steatosis, poses a significant global health concern due to the excessive accumulation of fat within the liver. If left untreated, this condition can give rise to severe complications. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI, specifically AI-based ultrasound imaging) offer promising tools for diagnosing this condition. This review endeavors to explore the current state of research concerning AI's role in diagnosing fatty liver disease, with a particular emphasis on imaging methods. To this end, a comprehensive search was conducted across electronic databases, including Google Scholar and Embase, to identify relevant studies published between January 2010 and May 2023, with keywords such as \"fatty liver disease\" and \"artificial intelligence (AI).\" The article selection process adhered to the PRISMA framework, ultimately resulting in the inclusion of 13 studies. These studies leveraged AI-assisted ultrasound due to its accessibility and cost-effectiveness, and they hailed from diverse countries, including India, China, Singapore, the United States, Egypt, Iran, Poland, Malaysia, and Korea. These studies employed a variety of AI classifiers, such as support vector machines, convolutional neural networks, multilayer perceptron, fuzzy Sugeno, and probabilistic neural networks, all of which demonstrated a remarkable level of precision. Notably, one study even achieved a diagnostic accuracy rate of 100%, underscoring AI's potential in diagnosing fatty liver disease. Nevertheless, the review acknowledged certain limitations within the included studies, with the majority featuring relatively small sample sizes, often encompassing fewer than 100 patients. Additionally, the variability in AI algorithms and imaging techniques added complexity to the comparative analysis. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the potential of AI in enhancing the diagnosis and management of fatty liver disease through advanced imaging techniques. Future research endeavors should prioritize the execution of large-scale studies that employ standardized AI algorithms and imaging techniques to validate AI's utility in diagnosing this prevalent health condition.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a progressive condition with high global incidence. HF has two main subtypes: HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). There is an inherent need for simple yet effective electrocardiogram (ECG)-based artificial intelligence (AI; ECG-AI) models that can predict HF risk early to allow for risk modification.\nThe main objectives were to validate HF risk prediction models using Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) data and assess performance on HFpEF and HFrEF classification.\nThere were six models in comparision derived using ARIC data. 1) The ECG-AI model predicting HF risk was developed using raw 12-lead ECGs with a convolutional neural network. The clinical models from 2) ARIC (ARIC-HF) and 3) Framingham Heart Study (FHS-HF) used 9 and 8 variables, respectively. 4) Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model developed using the clinical risk factors in ARIC-HF or FHS-HF. 5) CPH model using the outcome of ECG-AI and the clinical risk factors used in CPH model (ECG-AI-Cox) and 6) A Light Gradient Boosting Machine model using 288 ECG Characteristics (ECG-Chars). All the models were validated on MESA. The performances of these models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared using the DeLong test.\nECG-AI, ECG-Chars, and ECG-AI-Cox resulted in validation AUCs of 0.77, 0.73, and 0.84, respectively. ARIC-HF and FHS-HF yielded AUCs of 0.76 and 0.74, respectively, and CPH resulted in AUC = 0.78. ECG-AI-Cox outperformed all other models. ECG-AI-Cox provided an AUC of 0.85 for HFrEF and 0.83 for HFpEF.\nECG-AI using ECGs provides better-validated predictions when compared to HF risk calculators, and the ECG feature model and also works well with HFpEF and HFrEF classification.",

    "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) are the physiological signals and a standard test to measure the heart's electrical activity that depicts the movement of cardiac muscles. A review study has been conducted on ECG signals analysis with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) methods over the last ten years i.e., 2012-22. Primarily, the method of ECG analysis by software systems was divided into classical signal processing (e.g. spectrograms or filters), machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), including recursive models, transformers and hybrid. Secondly, the data sources and benchmark datasets were depicted. Authors grouped resources by ECG acquisition methods into hospital-based portable machines and wearable devices. Authors also included new trends like advanced pre-processing, data augmentation, simulations and agent-based modeling. The study found improvement in ECG examination perfection made each year through ML, DL, hybrid models, and transformers. Convolutional neural networks and hybrid models were more targeted and proved efficient. The transformer model extended the accuracy from 90% to 98%. The Physio-Net library helps acquire ECG signals, including the popular benchmark databases such as MIT-BIH, PTB, and challenging datasets. Similarly, wearable devices have been established as a appropriate option for monitoring patient health without the time and place limitations and are also helpful for AI model calibration with so far accuracy of 82%-83% on Samsung smartwatch. In the pre-processing signals, spectrogram generation through Fourier and wavelet transformations are erected leading approaches promoting on average accuracy of 90%-95%. Likewise, data enhancement using geometrical techniques is well-considered; however, extraction and concatenation-based methods need attention. As the what-if analysis in healthcare or cardiac issues can be performed using a complex simulation, the study reviews agent-based modeling and simulation approaches for cardiovascular risk event assessment.",

    "abstract": "Irrespective of men and women, colorectal cancer (CRC), is the third most common cancer in the population with more than 1.85 million cases annually. Fewer than 20% of patients only survive beyond five years from diagnosis. CRC is a highly preventable disease if diagnosed at the early stage of malignancy. Several screening methods like endoscopy (like colonoscopy; gold standard), imaging examination [computed tomographic colonography (CTC)], guaiac-based fecal occult blood (gFOBT), immunochemical test from faeces, and stool DNA test are available with different levels of sensitivity and specificity. The available screening methods are associated with certain drawbacks like invasiveness, cost, or sensitivity. In recent years, computer-aided systems-based screening, diagnosis, and treatment have been very promising in the early-stage detection and diagnosis of CRC cases. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an enormously in-demand, cost-effective technology, that uses various tools machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) to screen, diagnose, and stage, and has great potential to treat CRC. Moreover, different ML algorithms and neural networks [artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVMs)] have been deployed to predict precise and personalized treatment options. This review examines and summarizes different ML and DL models used for therapeutic intervention in CRC cancer along with the gap and challenges for AI.",

    "abstract": "Cardiogenic shock (CS) may have a negative impact on mortality in patients with heart failure (HF) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Early prediction of CS can result in improved survival. Artificial intelligence (AI) through machine learning (ML) models have\u00a0shown promise in predictive medicine. Here, we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of these models in the early prediction of CS. A thorough search of the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus databases was conducted from the time of inception until November 2, 2023, to find relevant studies. Our outcomes were area under the curve (AUC), the sensitivity and specificity of the ML model, the accuracy of the ML model, and the predictor variables that had the most impact in predicting CS. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) Version 3.0 was used to conduct the meta-analysis. Six studies were considered in our study. The pooled mean AUC was 0.808 (95% confidence interval: 0.727, 0.890). The AUC in the included studies ranged from 0.77 to 0.91. ML models performed well, with accuracy ranging from 0.88 to 0.93 and sensitivity and specificity of 58%-78% and 88%-93%, respectively. Age, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and blood glucose were the most significant variables required by ML models to acquire their outputs. In conclusion, AI has the potential for early prediction of CS, which may lead to a decrease in the high mortality rate associated with it. Future studies are needed to confirm the results.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have profoundly impacted various fields, including diagnostic imaging. Integrating AI technologies such as deep learning and convolutional neural networks has the potential to drastically improve diagnostic methods in the field\u00a0of dentistry and maxillofacial radiography. A systematic study that adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards was carried out to examine the efficacy and uses of AI in dentistry and maxillofacial radiography. Incorporating cohort studies, case-control studies, and randomized clinical trials, the study used an interdisciplinary methodology. A thorough search spanning peer-reviewed research papers from 2009 to 2023 was done in databases including MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE. The inclusion criteria were original clinical research in English that employed AI models to recognize anatomical components in oral and maxillofacial pictures, identify anomalies, and diagnose disorders. The study looked at numerous research that used cutting-edge technology to show how accurate and dependable dental imaging is. Among the tasks covered by these investigations were age estimation, periapical lesion detection, segmentation of maxillary structures, assessment of dentofacial abnormalities, and segmentation of the mandibular canal. The study revealed important developments in the precise definition of anatomical structures and the identification of diseases. The use of AI technology in dental imaging marks a revolutionary development that will usher in a time of unmatched accuracy and effectiveness. These technologies have not only improved diagnostic accuracy and enabled early disease detection but have also streamlined intricate procedures, significantly enhancing patient outcomes. The symbiotic collaboration between human expertise and machine intelligence promises a future of more sophisticated and empathetic oral healthcare.",

Reoperations, emergency (salvage), or cases requiring mechanical assist were excluded. Data were extracted from electronic medical records and chart reviews. Two primary outcome variables were length of stay in the intensive care unit (using Society of Thoracic Surgeons definitions) and acute kidney injury (using modified Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria). One secondary outcome variable, total initial ventilation hours, used Society of Thoracic Surgeons definitions. Differences in length of stay in the intensive care unit and total ventilation time were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and stepwise multiple linear regression. Acute kidney injury stage used chi-square and stepwise cumulative logistic regression.\nA total of 1404 cases (795 preprogram; 609 program) were identified. Overall reductions of 6.8 and 4.4\u00a0hours in intensive care unit length of stay (\nAdding artificial intelligence-guided hemodynamic management to cardiac enhanced recovery pathways resulted in associated reduced time in the intensive care unit for patients undergoing nonemergency cardiac surgery across institutions in a real-world setting.",

    "abstract": "Accurate staging of bladder cancer assists in identifying optimal treatment (e.g., transurethral resection vs. radical cystectomy vs. bladder preservation). However, currently, about one-third of patients are over-staged and one-third are under-staged. There is a pressing need for a more accurate staging modality to evaluate patients with bladder cancer to assist clinical decision-making. We hypothesize that MRI/RNA-seq-based radiogenomics and artificial intelligence can more accurately stage bladder cancer. A total of 40 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were available for analysis. Twenty-eight (28) MRI and their matched FFPE tissues were available for training analysis, and 12 matched MRI and FFPE tissues were used for validation. FFPE samples were subjected to bulk RNA-seq, followed by bioinformatics analysis. In the radiomics, several hundred image-based features from bladder tumors in MRI were extracted and analyzed. Overall, the model obtained mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 94%, 88%, and 92%, respectively, in differentiating intra- vs. extra-bladder cancer. The proposed model demonstrated improvement in the three matrices by 17%, 33%, and 25% and 17%, 16%, and 17% as compared to the genetic- and radiomic-based models alone, respectively. The radiogenomics of bladder cancer provides insight into discriminative features capable of more accurately staging bladder cancer. Additional studies are underway.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, edge intelligence (EI) has emerged, combining edge computing with AI, and specifically deep learning, to run AI algorithms directly on edge devices. In practical applications, EI faces challenges related to computational power, power consumption, size, and cost, with the primary challenge being the trade-off between computational power and power consumption. This has rendered traditional computing platforms unsustainable, making heterogeneous parallel computing platforms a crucial pathway for implementing EI. In our research, we leveraged the Xilinx Zynq 7000 heterogeneous computing platform, employed high-level synthesis (HLS) for design, and implemented two different accelerators for LeNet-5 using loop unrolling and pipelining optimization techniques. The experimental results show that when running at a clock speed of 100 MHz, the PIPELINE accelerator, compared to the UNROLL accelerator, experiences an 8.09% increase in power consumption but speeds up by 14.972 times, making the PIPELINE accelerator superior in performance. Compared to the CPU, the PIPELINE accelerator reduces power consumption by 91.37% and speeds up by 70.387 times, while compared to the GPU, it reduces power consumption by 93.35%. This study provides two different optimization schemes for edge intelligence applications through design and experimentation and demonstrates the impact of different quantization methods on FPGA resource consumption. These experimental results can provide a reference for practical applications, thereby providing a reference hardware acceleration scheme for edge intelligence applications.",

    "abstract": "The presence of chironomid larvae in tap water has sparked public concern regarding the water supply system in South Korea. Despite ongoing efforts to establish a safe water supply system, entirely preventing larval occurrences remains a significant challenge. Therefore, we developed a real-time chironomid larva detection system (RT-CLAD) based on deep learning technology, which was implemented in drinking water treatment plants. The acquisition of larval images was facilitated by a multi-spectral camera with a wide spectral range, enabling the capture of unique wavelet bands associated with larvae. Three state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, namely the convolutional neural network (CNN), you only look once (YOLO), and residual neural network (ResNet), renowned for their exceptional performance in object detection tasks, were employed. Following a comparative analysis of these algorithms, the most accurate and rapid model was selected for RT-CLAD. To achieve the efficient and accurate detection of larvae, the original images were transformed into a specific wavelet format, followed by preprocessing to minimize data size. Consequently, the CNN, YOLO, and ResNet algorithms successfully detected larvae with 100% accuracy. In comparison to YOLO and ResNet, the CNN algorithm demonstrated greater efficiency because of its faster processing and simpler architecture. We anticipate that our RT-CLAD will address larva detection challenges in water treatment plants, thereby enhancing water supply security.",

    "abstract": "This work involves exploring non-invasive sensor technologies for data collection and preprocessing, specifically focusing on novel thermal calibration methods and assessing low-cost infrared radiation sensors for facial temperature analysis. Additionally, it investigates innovative approaches to analyzing acoustic signals for quantifying coughing episodes. The research integrates diverse data capture technologies to analyze them collectively, considering their temporal evolution and physical attributes, aiming to extract statistically significant relationships among various variables for valuable insights. The study delineates two distinct aspects: cough detection employing a microphone and a neural network, and thermal sensors employing a calibration curve to refine their output values, reducing errors within a specified temperature range. Regarding control units, the initial implementation with an ESP32 transitioned to a Raspberry Pi model 3B+ due to neural network integration issues. A comprehensive testing is conducted for both fever and cough detection, ensuring robustness and accuracy in each scenario. The subsequent work involves practical experimentation and interoperability tests, validating the proof of concept for each system component. Furthermore, this work assesses the technical specifications of the prototype developed in the preceding tasks. Real-time testing is performed for each symptom to evaluate the system's effectiveness. This research contributes to the advancement of non-invasive sensor technologies, with implications for healthcare applications such as remote health monitoring and early disease detection.",

    "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is intricately linked to obesity and diabetes, which are widespread risk factors. Medical imaging, especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plays a major role in EC assessment, particularly for disease staging. However, the diagnostic performance of MRI exhibits variability in the detection of clinically relevant prognostic factors (e.g., deep myometrial invasion and metastatic lymph nodes assessment). To address these challenges and enhance the value of MRI, radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms emerge as promising tools with a potential to impact EC risk assessment, treatment planning, and prognosis prediction. These advanced post-processing techniques allow us to quantitatively analyse medical images, providing novel insights into cancer characteristics beyond conventional qualitative image evaluation. However, despite the growing interest and research efforts, the integration of radiomics and AI to EC management is still far from clinical practice and represents a possible perspective rather than an actual reality. This review focuses on the state of radiomics and AI in EC MRI, emphasizing risk stratification and prognostic factor prediction, aiming to illuminate potential advancements and address existing challenges in the field.",

    "abstract": "Leprosy is a neglected tropical disease that can cause physical injury and mental disability. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, but can be inconclusive due to the absence of initial symptoms and similarity to other dermatological diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been used in dermatology, assisting clinical procedures and diagnostics. In particular, AI-supported solutions have been proposed in the literature to aid in the diagnosis of leprosy, and this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) aims to characterize the state of the art. This SLR followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) framework and was conducted in the following databases: ACM Digital Library, IEEE Digital Library, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. Potentially relevant research articles were retrieved. The researchers applied criteria to select the studies, assess their quality, and perform the data extraction process. Moreover, 1659 studies were retrieved, of which 21 were included in the review after selection. Most of the studies used images of skin lesions, classical machine learning algorithms, and multi-class classification tasks to develop models to diagnose dermatological diseases. Most of the reviewed articles did not target leprosy as the study's primary objective but rather the classification of different skin diseases (among them, leprosy). Although AI-supported leprosy diagnosis is constantly evolving, research in this area is still in its early stage, then studies are required to make AI solutions mature enough to be transformed into clinical practice. Expanding research efforts on leprosy diagnosis, coupled with the advocacy of open science in leveraging AI for diagnostic support, can yield robust and influential outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid cancer, specifically differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), is one of the most prevalent endocrine malignancies worldwide. Radioactive iodine therapy (RAIT) using I-131 has been a standard-of-care approach for DTC due to its ability to ablate remnant thyroid disease following surgery, thus reducing the risk of recurrence. It is also used for the treatment of iodine-avid metastases. RAIT dosimetry can be employed to determine the optimal treatment dose of I-131 to effectively treat cancer cells while safeguarding against undesirable radiation effects such as bone marrow toxicity or radiation pneumonitis. Conventional dosimetry protocols for RAIT, however, are complex and time-consuming, involving multiple days of imaging and blood sampling. This study explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in simplifying and optimizing RAIT. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 83 adult patients with DTC who underwent RAIT dosimetry at our institution between 1996 and 2023. The conventional MIRD-based dosimetry protocol involved imaging and blood sampling at 4, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-administration of a tracer activity of I-131. An AI system based on a deep-learning neural network was developed to predict the maximum permissible activity (MPA) for RAIT using only the data obtained from the initial 4, 24, and 48 h time points. The AI system predicted the MPA values with high accuracy, showing no significant difference compared to the results obtained from conventional MIRD-based analysis utilizing a paired ",

    "abstract": "DUS measurements for popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) specifically can be time-consuming, error-prone, and operator-dependent. To eliminate this subjectivity and provide efficient segmentation, we applied artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately delineate inner and outer lumen on DUS. DUS images were selected from a cohort of patients with PAAs from a multi-institutional platform. Encord is an easy-to-use, readily available online AI platform that was used to segment both the inner lumen and outer lumen of the PAA on DUS images. A model trained on 20 images and tested on 80 images had a mean Average Precision of 0.85 for the outer polygon and 0.23 for the inner polygon. The outer polygon had a higher recall score than precision score at 0.90 and 0.85, respectively. The inner polygon had a score of 0.25 for both precision and recall. The outer polygon false-negative rate was the lowest in images with the least amount of blur. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the widely available Encord AI platform to identify standard features of PAAs that are critical for operative decision making.",

    "abstract": "Caring behavior is a major focus of the nursing profession and an important dimension of nursing practice that sets nurses apart from other healthcare professionals. Effective patient-centered care requires ensuring nurses have the emotional intelligence and happiness to address the daily demands of practice. The purpose of this study is to examine the emotional intelligence and happiness among nursing students and their relationship with caring behaviors.\nA cross-sectional, descriptive correlational study was conducted on nursing students (\nNursing students reported their highest degree of caring was in terms of 'respectful differences to others', while their lowest was in 'knowledge and skills'. Emotional intelligence and happiness were significant predictors of caring behaviors and explained the variance in assurance of human presence (17.5%), knowledge and skills (17.5%), respectful differences to others (18%), and positive connectedness (12.9%). In the final regression model, emotional intelligence and happiness were significant predictors of caring behaviors and explained 19.5% of the variance.\nEmotional intelligence and happiness among nursing students were found to be important factors to improve their caregiving behaviors. Therefore, nursing educators should consider integrating emotional intelligence and happiness interventions for students into their curriculum.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we developed an AI-based real-time motion feedback system for patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) during rehabilitation, aiming to enhance their interest and motivation. The effectiveness of the system in improving upper-limb muscle strength during the Thera band exercises was evaluated. The motion analysis program, including exercise repetition counts and calorie consumption, was developed using MediaPipe, focusing on three key motions (chest press, shoulder press, and arm curl) for upper extremity exercises. The participants with SCI were randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG = 4) or control group (CG = 5), engaging in 1 h sessions three times a week for 8 weeks. Muscle strength tests (chest press, shoulder press, lat pull-down, and arm curl) were performed before and after exercises. Although both groups did not show significant differences, the EG group exhibited increased strength in all measured variables, whereas the CG group showed constant or reduced results. Consequently, the computer program-based system developed in this study could be effective in muscle strengthening. Furthermore, these findings may serve as a valuable foundation for future AI-driven rehabilitation exercise systems.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify and analyze the main constituent elements of text generated by ChatGPT in response to questions on an emerging topic in the academic literature in Portuguese - health literacy - and discuss how the evidence produced can contribute to improving our understanding of the limits and challenges of using artificial intelligence (AI) in academic writing. We conducted an exploratory descriptive study based on responses to five consecutive questions in Portuguese and English with increasing levels of complexity put to ChatGPT. Our findings reveal the potential of the use of widely available, unrestricted access AI-based technologies like ChatGPT for academic writing. Featuring a simple and intuitive interface, the tool generated structured and coherent text using natural-like language. Considering that academic productivism is associated with a growing trend in professional misconduct, especially plagiarism, there is a need too take a careful look at academic writing and scientific knowledge dissemination processes mediated by AI technologies.\nO presente estudo buscou conhecer as principais caracter\u00edsticas das respostas geradas pela ferramenta ChatGPT a consultas sobre um tema emergente na literatura acad\u00eamica de l\u00edngua portuguesa - a literacia em sa\u00fade -, assim como discutir de que forma tais evid\u00eancias podem contribuir para uma melhor compreens\u00e3o sobre os limites e os desafios relacionados ao uso de Intelig\u00eancia Artificial (IA) para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o do conhecimento acad\u00eamico. Trata-se de um estudo descritivo e explorat\u00f3rio, baseado em consultas ao ChatGPT, a partir de cinco perguntas disparadoras, feitas em sequ\u00eancia, nas l\u00ednguas portuguesa (Brasil) e inglesa, com n\u00edveis de complexidade lingu\u00edstica crescentes. A an\u00e1lise dos resultados evidenciou uma ampla perspectiva para o uso de tecnologias baseadas em IA, como o ChatGPT, uma ferramenta disponibilizada de forma ampla e irrestrita, com uma interface intuitiva e simples, que se mostrou capaz de gerar textos coerentes, estruturados, em linguagem natural. Considerando o fen\u00f4meno do produtivismo acad\u00eamico, associado a uma tend\u00eancia crescente de m\u00e1 conduta profissional, sobretudo o pl\u00e1gio, coloca-se necessidade de um olhar ainda mais cuidadoso sobre o processo de produ\u00e7\u00e3o e divulga\u00e7\u00e3o do conhecimento cient\u00edfico mediado por tecnologias de IA.",

    "abstract": "The objective of our study was to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model and detection and classification of benign and malignant radiolucent lesions in orthopantomogram (OPG) by implementing CNN.\nTwo basic CNN models were implemented on Anaconda with Python 3 on 64-bit, CNN-I for detection of radiolucency and CNN-II for classification of radiolucency into benign and malignant lesions. One hundred fifty eight OPG with radiolucency and 115 OPG without radiolucency was used for training and validation of CNN models. Data augmentation was performed for the training and validation dataset. The evaluation of the performance of both CNN by new data consisting (60 OPG images) 30 benign and 30 malignant lesions.\nPerformed using SPSS (Statistical package for social science) 20.0 version. The descriptive statistics was performed. The Cohen kappa correlation coefficient was used for assessment of reliability of the diagnostic methods. P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Determination of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value was also performed.\nCNN-I showing sensitivity for detection of the benign lesion is 76.6% and sensitivity for the malignant lesion is 63.3% with overall sensitivity is 70%. CNN-II showing sensitivity for classification of the benign lesion is 70% and for classification of the malignant lesion is 63.3% with overall classification sensitivity is 66.6%. The kappa correlation coefficient value for diagnosis made by CNN-II is 0.333 and P < .05.\nBoth CNN showed statistically significant and satisfactory results in detecting and classifying radiolucency in OPG.",

    "abstract": "Network pharmacology (NP) provides a new methodological perspective for understanding traditional medicine from a holistic perspective, giving rise to frontiers such as traditional Chinese medicine network pharmacology (TCM-NP). With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, it is key for NP to develop network-based AI methods to reveal the treatment mechanism of complex diseases from massive omics data. In this review, focusing on the TCM-NP, we summarize involved AI methods into three categories: network relationship mining, network target positioning and network target navigating, and present the typical application of TCM-NP in uncovering biological basis and clinical value of Cold/Hot syndromes. Collectively, our review provides researchers with an innovative overview of the methodological progress of NP and its application in TCM from the AI perspective.",

    "abstract": "The development of costs-effective and sensitive screening solutions to prevent amblyopia and identify its risk factors (strabismus, refractive problems or mixed) is a significant priority of pediatric ophthalmology. The main objective of our study was to compare the classification performance of various vision screening tests, including classic, stereoacuity-based tests (Lang II, TNO, Stereo Fly, and Frisby), and non-stereoacuity-based, low-density static, dynamic, and noisy anaglyphic random dot stereograms. We determined whether the combination of non-stereoacuity-based tests integrated in the simplest artificial intelligence (AI) model could be an alternative method for vision screening.\nOur study, conducted in Spain and Hungary, is a non-experimental, cross-sectional diagnostic test assessment focused on pediatric eye conditions. Using convenience sampling, we enrolled 423 children aged 3.6-14\u2009years, diagnosed with amblyopia, strabismus, or refractive errors, and compared them to age-matched emmetropic controls. Comprehensive pediatric ophthalmologic examinations ascertained diagnoses. Participants used filter glasses for stereovision tests and red-green goggles for an AI-based test over their prescribed glasses. Sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were our metrics, with sensitivity being the primary endpoint. AUCs were analyzed using DeLong's method, and binary classifications (pathologic vs. normal) were evaluated using McNemar's matched pair and Fisher's nonparametric tests.\nFour non-overlapping groups were studied: (1) amblyopia (\nThe combination of multiple tests utilizing anaglyphic random dot stereograms with varying parameters (density, noise, dynamism) in AI leads to the most advanced and sensitive screening test for identifying amblyopia and amblyogenic conditions compared to all the other tests studied.",

    "abstract": "To provide an overview of global publications on artificial intelligence (AI) in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) through bibliometric analysis.\nPublications related to AI in TAO from inception until April 2023 were retrieved from the Web of Science database. The trends of publications and citations, publishing performance, collaboration among countries and institutions, and the funding agencies, relevant research domains, leading journals, hotspots and their evolution were identified.\nA total of 55 publications were included for analysis. The number of publications and citations continued to grow since 1998, with a significant acceleration of growth after 2020. China is the most productive country with the highest number of productive institutions, followed by the United States. European countries have the most extensive collaboration. The most relevant research domain was radiology, nuclear medicine & medical imaging. The European Journal of Radiology was one of the most productive journals, with the most influential articles published. \"Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy\" and \"neural network\" maintain hotspots during the entire period. Studies were more focused on clinical features during 1998 and 2016, clinical features and medical data during 2017 and 2020, and medical data and AI techniques during 2021 and 2023.\nThis study summarized the global research status regarding AI in TAO in terms of trends, countries, institutions, research domains, journals, and key topics. AI has shown great potential in TAO. Sponsored by funding agencies such as NSFC, China has become the most productive country in the field of AI in TAO. Our findings help researchers better understand the development of this field and provide valuable clues for future research directions.",

    "abstract": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) is a fellowship in applied epidemiology for physicians, veterinarians, nurses, scientists, and other health professionals. Each EIS fellow is assigned to a position at a federal, state, or local site for 2\u2009years of on-the-job training in outbreak investigation, epidemiologic research, surveillance system evaluation, and scientific communication. Although the original focus of the program on the control of infectious diseases remains salient, positions are available for training in other areas of public health, including occupational respiratory disease. In this Perspective, we describe the EIS program, highlight three positions (one federal and two state-based) that provide training in occupational respiratory epidemiology, and summarize trainees' experiences in these positions over a 30-year period. For early-career health professionals interested in understanding and preventing occupational respiratory hazards and diseases, EIS offers a unique career development opportunity.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing our life, including the medical field. Repeated machine learning using big data made various fields more predictable and accurate. In medicine, IBM Watson for Oncology (WFO), trained by Memorial Slone Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), was first introduced and applied in 14 countries worldwide.Our study was designed to assess the feasibility of WFO in actual clinical practice. We aimed to investigate the concordance rate between WFO and multidisciplinary tumor board (MTB) in Urologic cancer patients.\nWe reviewed retrospectively collected data for consecutive patients who underwent WFO and MTB simultaneously in the diagnosis of urologic malignancy before determining further treatment between August 2017 and September 2020. We compared the recommendation of the AI system, WFO (IBM Watson Health, Cambridge, MA), with the opinion of MTB for further managing all patients diagnosed with urologic malignancies such as prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer.\nA total of 55 patients were enrolled in our study. The number of patients with prostate cancer was 48. The number of bladder and kidney cancer patients was 5 and 2, respectively. The overall concordance rate between WFO and MTB was 92.7%. Three patients could not suggest proper treatment options using WFO, and the recommended choice of WFO was not feasible in the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service.\nThe decision of WFO showed a high concordance rate with a multidisciplinary tumor board for urologic oncology. However, some recommendations of WFO were not feasible in actual practice, and WFO still has some points to improve and modify. Interestingly, applying WFO is likely to facilitate a multidisciplinary team approach.",

    "abstract": "Pneumoconiosis is the occupational disease with the highest burden in China currently. The diagnosis of pneumoconiosis mainly relies on manual reading of X-ray high-kilovoltage or digital photography chest radiograph, which has some problems such as low efficiency, strong subjectivity, and cannot accurately judge the critical lesions. With the progress of machine-aided diagnosis technology, the efficient, objective and quantitative of artificial intelligence diagnosis technology just solve the shortcomings above. This paper reviews the research progress in digital chest radiography diagnosis of pneumoconiosis using artificial intelligence technology, especially deep learning model, combined with the limitations of conventional manual reading, in order to clarify the application prospect of artificial intelligence technology in the diagnosis of pneumoconiosis by digital chest radiography, and provide a direction for future research in this field.\n\u5c18\u80ba\u75c5\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u6211\u56fd\u8d1f\u62c5\u6700\u91cd\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u75c5\uff0c\u5176\u8bca\u65ad\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u9760\u4eba\u5de5\u9605\u8bfbX\u5c04\u7ebf\u9ad8\u5343\u4f0f\u6216\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u6444\u5f71\u80f8\u7247\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u5bf9\u4e34\u754c\u75c5\u53d8\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u5224\u65ad\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8bca\u65ad\u6280\u672f\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u7b49\u7279\u70b9\u6070\u597d\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u76ee\u524d\u5e94\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c18\u80ba\u75c5\u6570\u5b57\u80f8\u7247\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5e38\u89c4\u4eba\u5de5\u8bfb\u7247\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u9610\u660e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5c18\u80ba\u75c5\u6570\u5b57\u80f8\u7247\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002.",

    "abstract": "Despite the high efficacy of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), approximately 1-3% of hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients fail to achieve a sustained virological response. We conducted a nationwide study to investigate risk factors associated with DAA treatment failure. Machine-learning algorithms have been applied to discriminate subjects who may fail to respond to DAA therapy.\nWe analyzed the Taiwan HCV Registry Program database to explore predictors of DAA failure in HCV patients. Fifty-five host and virological features were assessed using multivariate logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and artificial neural network. The primary outcome was undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after the end of treatment.\nThe training (n=23,955) and validation (n=10,346) datasets had similar baseline demographics, with an overall DAA failure rate of 1.6% (n=538). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, poor DAA adherence, and higher hemoglobin A1c were significantly associated with virological failure. XGBoost outperformed the other algorithms and logistic regression models, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 1.000 in the training dataset and 0.803 in the validation dataset. The top five predictors of treatment failure were HCV RNA, body mass index, \u03b1-fetoprotein, platelets, and FIB-4 index. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the XGBoost model (cutoff value=0.5) were 99.5%, 69.7%, 99.9%, 97.4%, and 99.5%, respectively, for the entire dataset.\nMachine learning algorithms effectively provide risk stratification for DAA failure and additional information on the factors associated with DAA failure.",

XGBoost outperformed the other algorithms and logistic regression models, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 1.000 in the training dataset and 0.803 in the validation dataset. The top five predictors of treatment failure were HCV RNA, body mass index, \u03b1-fetoprotein, platelets, and FIB-4 index. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the XGBoost model (cutoff value=0.5) were 99.5%, 69.7%, 99.9%, 97.4%, and 99.5%, respectively, for the entire dataset.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer has the highest incidence and second-highest mortality rate among all cancers. The management of breast cancer is being revolutionized by artificial intelligence (AI), which is improving early detection, pathological diagnosis, risk assessment, individualized treatment recommendations, and treatment response prediction. Nuclear medicine has used artificial intelligence (AI) for over 50 years, but more recent advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have given AI in nuclear medicine additional capabilities. AI accurately analyzes breast imaging scans for early detection, minimizing false negatives while offering radiologists reliable, swift image processing assistance. It smoothly fits into radiology workflows, which may result in early treatments and reduced expenditures. In pathological diagnosis, artificial intelligence improves the quality of diagnostic data by ensuring accurate diagnoses, lowering inter-observer variability, speeding up the review process, and identifying errors or poor slides. By taking into consideration nutritional, genetic, and environmental factors, providing individualized risk assessments, and recommending more regular tests for higher-risk patients, AI aids with the risk assessment of breast\u00a0cancer. The integration of clinical and genetic data into individualized treatment recommendations by AI facilitates collaborative decision-making and resource allocation optimization while also enabling patient progress monitoring, drug interaction consideration, and alignment with clinical guidelines. AI is used to analyze patient data, imaging, genomic data, and pathology reports in order to forecast how a treatment would respond. These models anticipate treatment outcomes, make sure that clinical recommendations are followed, and learn from historical data. The implementation of AI in medicine is hampered by issues with data quality, integration with healthcare IT systems, data protection, bias reduction, and ethical considerations, necessitating transparency and constant surveillance. Protecting patient privacy, resolving biases, maintaining transparency, identifying fault for mistakes, and ensuring fair access are just a few examples of ethical considerations. To preserve patient trust and address the effect on the healthcare workforce, ethical frameworks must be developed. The amazing potential of AI in the treatment of breast cancer calls for careful examination of its ethical and practical implications. We aim to review the comprehensive role of artificial intelligence in breast cancer management.",

    "abstract": "The primary source of energy losses in distribution networks (DNs) is rooted in line losses, which is crucial to conduct a thorough and reasonable examination of any unusual sources of line losses to guarantee the power supply in a timely and safe manner. In recent studies, identifying and analyzing abnormal line losses in DNs has been a widely and challenging research subject. This article investigates a key technology for the line loss analyses of DNs and intelligent diagnosis of abnormal causes by implementing artificial intelligence (AI), resulting in several prominent results. The proposed algorithm optimizes the parameters of the support vector machine (SVM) and suggests an intelligent diagnosis algorithm called the Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm and Support Vector Machine (ISSA-SVM). The ISSA-SVM algorithm is trained to calculate the data anomalies of line losses when changing loads and exhibiting exceptional performance to identify abnormal line losses. The accuracy of abnormality identification employing the ISSA-SVM algorithm reaches an impressive 98%, surpassing the performances of other available algorithms. Moreover, the practical performance of the proposed approach for analyzing large volumes of abnormal line loss data daily in DNs is also noteworthy. The ISSA-SVM accurately identifies the root causes of abnormal line losses and lowers the error in calculating abnormal line loss data. By combining different types of power operation data and creating a multidimensional feature traceability model, the study successfully determines the factors contributing to abnormal line losses. The relationship between transformers and voltage among various lines is determined by using the Pearson correlation, which provides valuable insights into the relationship between these variables and line losses. The algorithm's reliability and its potential to be applied to real-world scenarios bring an opportunity to improve the efficiency and safety of power supply systems. The ISSA that incorporates advanced techniques such as the Sobol sequence, golden sine algorithm, and Gaussian difference mutation appears to be a promising tool.",

    "abstract": "To systematically evaluate the ability of the CINA\u00ae LVO software to detect large vessel occlusions eligible for mechanical thrombectomy on CTA using conventional neuroradiological assessment as gold standard.\nRetrospectively, two hundred consecutive patients referred for a brain CTA and two hundred patients that had been subject for endovascular thrombectomy, with an accessible preceding CTA, were assessed for large vessel occlusions (LVO) using the CINA\u00ae LVO software. The patients were sub-grouped by occlusion site. The original radiology report was used as ground truth and cases with disagreement were reassessed. Two-by-two tables were created and measures for LVO detection were calculated.\nA total of four-hundred patients were included; 221 LVOs were present in 215 patients (54 %). The overall specificity was high for LVOs in the anterior circulation (93 %). The overall sensitivity for LVOs in the anterior circulation was 54 % with the highest sensitivity for the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (87 %) and T-type internal carotid occlusions (84 %). The sensitivity was low for occlusions in the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery (13 % and 0 % for proximal and distal M2 occlusions respectively) and in posterior circulation occlusions (0 %, not included in the intended use of the software).\nLVO detection sensitivity for the CINA\u00ae LVO software differs largely depending on the location of the occlusion, with low sensitivity for detection of some LVOs potentially eligible for mechanical thrombectomy. Further development of the software to increase sensitivity to all LVO locations would increase the clinical usefulness.",

    "abstract": "The author traces his experience with the application of computers in clinical microbiology over the past 60 years, specifically in directing clinicians to treat bacterial infections diagnosed by the laboratory and the antibacterial agent(s) that could be used to treat those infections. Appropriate use of antibiotics will result in reduced antimicrobial resistance, which is increasing worldwide. An early form of AI, Mycin (1976), a system based on rules provided by experts designed to propose antibiotic regimens for central nervous system infections, was never applied due to the limitations in the number of rules that could be incorporated into the clinical workflow. Machine learning (ML) was developed to overcome the limitations of expert systems. Several variables that influence the outcome bacteria/drug interaction, such as the source of the infection, absence of antimicrobial resistance markers, patients' health profile, and the historical susceptibility within the hospital and the local area are incorporated in the proposed comprehensive AI/ML program. The role of AI in the discovery of new antimicrobial agents is also addressed.",

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) shocked the world with its unprecedented ability and raised significant tensions in the education field. Educators inevitably transition to an educational future that embraces GAI rather than shuns it. Understanding the mechanism between students interacting with GAI tools and their achievement is important for educators and schools, but relevant empirical evidence is relatively lacking. Due to the characteristics of personalization and real-time interactivity of GAI tools, we propose that the students-GAI interaction would affect their learning achievement through serial mediators of self-efficacy and cognitive engagement. Based on questionnaire surveys that include 389 participants as the objective, this study finds that: (1) in total, there is a significantly positive relationship between student-GAI interaction and learning achievement. (2) This positive relationship is mediated by self-efficacy, with a significant mediation effect value of 0.015. (3) Cognitive engagement also acts as a mediator in the mechanism between the student-GAI interaction and learning achievement, evidenced by a significant and relatively strong mediating effect value of 0.046. (4) Self-efficacy and cognitive engagement in series mediate this positive association, with a serial mediating effect value of 0.011, which is relatively small in comparison but also shows significance. In addition, the propensity score matching (PSM) method is applied to alleviate self-selection bias, reinforcing the validity of the results. The findings offer empirical evidence for the incorporation of GAI in teaching and learning.",

    "abstract": "Barrett's esophagus (BE), which has increased in prevalence worldwide, is a precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Although there is a gap in the detection rates between endoscopic BE and histological BE in current research, we trained our artificial intelligence (AI) system with images of endoscopic BE and tested the system with images of histological BE.\nTo assess whether an AI system can aid in the detection of BE in our setting.\nEndoscopic narrow-band imaging (NBI) was collected from Chung Shan Medical University Hospital and Changhua Christian Hospital, resulting in 724 cases, with 86 patients having pathological results. Three senior endoscopists, who were instructing physicians of the Digestive Endoscopy Society of Taiwan, independently annotated the images in the development set to determine whether each image was classified as an endoscopic BE. The test set consisted of 160 endoscopic images of 86 cases with histological results.\nSix pre-trained models were compared, and EfficientNetV2B2 (accuracy [ACC]: 0.8) was selected as the backbone architecture for further evaluation due to better ACC results. In the final test, the AI system correctly identified 66 of 70 cases of BE and 85 of 90 cases without BE, resulting in an ACC of 94.37%.\nOur AI system, which was trained by NBI of endoscopic BE, can adequately predict endoscopic images of histological BE. The ACC, sensitivity, and specificity are 94.37%, 94.29%, and 94.44%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Gastroenterology is a particularly data-rich field, generating vast repositories of data that are a fruitful ground for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications. In this opinion review, we initially elaborate on the current status of the application of AI/ML-based software in gastroenterology. Currently, AI/ML-based models have been developed in the following applications: Models integrated into the clinical setting following real-time patient data flagging patients at high risk for developing a gastrointestinal disease, models employing non-invasive parameters that provide accurate diagnoses aiming to either replace, minimize, or refine the indications of endoscopy, models utilizing genomic data to diagnose various gastrointestinal diseases, computer-aided diagnosis systems facilitating the interpretation of endoscopy images, models to facilitate treatment allocation and predict the response to treatment, and finally, models in prognosis predicting complications, recurrence following treatment, and overall survival. Then, we elaborate on several challenges and how they may negatively impact the widespread application of AI in healthcare and gastroenterology. Specifically, we elaborate on concerns regarding accuracy, cost-effectiveness, cybersecurity, interpretability, oversight, and liability. While AI is unlikely to replace physicians, it will transform the skillset demanded by future physicians to practice. Thus, physicians are expected to engage with AI to avoid becoming obsolete.",

    "abstract": "The role of artificial intelligence is emergent in facial plastic surgery. It offers specialists a potentially precise and efficient method of understanding our technical skills and pathways, and their impacts on patient outcomes and error rates. Algorithms have given life to personalised pre-operative assessment, surgical planning and outcome simulation, and post-operative monitoring. Despite these benefits, limitations at this time include the ethical acquisition of large datasets, biases produced by human input and trust in novel technologies. Careful consideration should be given to the role artificial intelligence may play in shaping the patient-surgeon relationship in the near future.",

    "abstract": "T-wave alternans (TWA) analysis was shown in >14,000 individuals studied worldwide over the past two decades to be a useful tool to assess risk for cardiovascular mortality and sudden arrhythmic death. TWA analysis by the modified moving average (MMA) method is FDA-cleared and CMS-reimbursed (CAG-00293R2).\nBecause the MMA technique is inherently suitable for dynamic tracking of alternans levels, it was selected for development of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled algorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to achieve rapid, efficient, and accurate assessment of P-wave alternans (PWA), R-wave alternans (RWA), and TWA.\nThe novel application of CNN algorithms to enhance MMA analysis generated efficient and powerful pattern-recognition algorithms for highly accurate alternans quantification. Algorithm reliability and accuracy were verified using simulated ECGs achieving R\nAccuracy of the new AI-MMA algorithms in TWA analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a05) was significantly improved over unsupervised, automated MMA output (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036) and did not differ from conventional MMA analysis with expert overreading (p\u00a0=\u00a00.21). Accuracy of AI-MMA in PWA analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a045) was significantly improved over unsupervised, automated MMA output (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005) and did not differ from conventional MMA analysis with expert overreading (p\u00a0=\u00a00.89). TWA and PWA by AI-MMA were correlated with conventional MMA output over-read by an expert reader (R\nThis novel technique for AI-MMA analysis could be suitable for use in diverse in-hospital and out-of-hospital monitoring systems, including cardiac implantable electronic devices and smartwatches, for tracking atrial and ventricular arrhythmia risk.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronically progressive mental condition, associated with a reduced quality of life and greater disability. Patient admissions are preventable events with a considerable impact on global functioning and social adjustment. While machine learning (ML) approaches have proven prediction ability in other diseases, little is known about their utility to predict patient admissions in this pathology.\nTo develop prediction models for hospital admission/readmission within 5\u2009years of diagnosis in patients with BD using ML techniques.\nThe study utilized data from patients diagnosed with BD in a major healthcare organization in Colombia. Candidate predictors were selected from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and included sociodemographic and clinical variables. ML algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Logistic Regressions, and Support Vector Machines, were used to predict patient admission or readmission. Survival models, including a penalized Cox Model and Random Survival Forest, were used to predict time to admission and first readmission. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and concordance index.\nThe admission dataset included 2,726 BD patients, with 354 admissions, while the readmission dataset included 352 patients, with almost half being readmitted. The best-performing model for predicting admission was the Random Forest, with an accuracy score of 0.951 and an AUC of 0.98. The variables with the greatest predictive power in the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) importance analysis were the number of psychiatric emergency visits, the number of outpatient follow-up appointments and age. Survival models showed similar results, with the Random Survival Forest performing best, achieving an AUC of 0.95. However, the prediction models for patient readmission had poorer performance, with the Random Forest model being again the best performer but with an AUC below 0.70.\nML models, particularly the Random Forest model, outperformed traditional statistical techniques for admission prediction. However, readmission prediction models had poorer performance. This study demonstrates the potential of ML techniques in improving prediction accuracy for BD patient admissions.",

Our goal in this research is to compare two methods for decreasing the annotation time to establish ground truth: Skip-slice annotation and AI-initiated annotation.\nWe developed a 2D U-Net as an AI second observer for detecting colorectal cancer (CRC) and an ensemble of 5 differently initiated 2D U-Net for ensemble technique. Each model was trained with 51 cases of annotated CRC computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, tested with 7 cases, and validated with 20 cases from The Cancer Imaging Archive cases. The sensitivity, false positives per case, and estimated Dice coefficient were obtained for each method of training. We compared the two methods of annotations and the time reduction associated with the technique. The time differences were tested using Friedman's two-way analysis of variance.\nSparse annotation significantly reduces the time for annotation particularly skipping 2 slices at a time (\nOur data support the sparse annotation technique as an efficient technique for reducing the time needed to establish the ground truth.",

Children with DS have varying intelligence quotient (IQ) that can predict their learning abilities.\nTo assess the brain metabolic profiles of children with DS and compare them to standard controls, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and correlating the results with IQ.\nThis case-control study included 40 children with DS aged 6-15 years and 40 age and sex-matched healthy children as controls. MRS was used to evaluate ratios of choline/creatine (Cho/Cr), N-acetyl aspartic acid/creatine (NAA/Cr), and myoinositol/creatine (MI/Cr (in the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes and basal ganglia and compared to controls and correlated with IQ.\nChildren with DS showed significant reductions in NAA/Cr and MI/Cr and a non-significant reduction in Cho/Cr in frontal lobes compared to controls. Additionally, we observed significant decreases in NAA/Cr, MI/Cr, and Cho/Cr in the temporal and occipital lobes and basal ganglia in children with DS compared to controls. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between IQ and metabolic ratios in the brains of children with DS.\nBrain metabolic profile could be a good predictor of IQ in children with DS.",

    "abstract": "The key components dominating the quality of green tea and black tea are still unclear. Here, we respectively produced green and black teas in March and June, and investigated the correlations between sensory quality and chemical compositions of dry teas by multivariate statistics, bioinformatics and artificial intelligence algorithm. The key chemical indices were screened out to establish tea sensory quality-prediction models based on the result of OPLS-DA and random forest, namely 4 flavonol glycosides of green tea and 8 indices of black tea (4 pigments, epigallocatechin, kaempferol-3-O-rhamnosyl-glucoside, ratios of caffeine/total catechins and epi/non-epi catechins). Compared with OPLS-DA and random forest, the support vector machine model had good sensory quality-prediction performance for both green tea and black tea (F1-score\u00a0>\u00a00.92), even based on the indices of fresh tea leaves. Our study explores the potential of artificial intelligence algorithm in classification and prediction of tea products with different sensory quality.",

    "abstract": "To improve and even reverse sarcopenia in elderly people, this study developed a self-determined sequence exercise program consisting of strength training exercise, Yijinjing exercise (a traditional Chinese exercise), and hybrid strength training with Yijinjing exercise. Ninety-four community-dwelling older adults screened for sarcopenia using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria were randomly assigned to 24 weeks of a control group (CG, n = 30), self-determined sequence exercise program group (SDSG, n = 34) or strength training group (STG, n = 30). The study examined the effects of three interventions on participantsL3 skeletal muscle fat density, L3 skeletal muscle fat area, L3 skeletal muscle density, L3 skeletal muscle area, muscle fat infiltration, relative skeletal muscle mass index, and grip strength using a repeated-measures ANOVA to evaluate the experimental data. To evaluate the real effect of this model in reversing sarcopenia after the intervention, nine classification models were trained. Significant interaction effects were observed with grip strength, RSMI, L3 SMD, and L3 SMA. At the 24th week, participants' grip strength, L3 SMFA, L3 SMA, and RSMI were improved significantly in the SDSG and STG. The SDSG achieved significantly greater RSMI and grip strength than the STG and CG after the intervention. The self-determined sequence exercise program exhibited better performance than the single type of exercise modality in reversing sarcopenia and improving older adults' skeletal muscle area. Consequently, the stacking model is feasible to make a prediction as to whether or not sarcopenia may be reversed in older adults.",

    "abstract": "There is emerging evidence which suggests the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the diagnostic assessment and pre-treatment evaluation of thyroid eye disease (TED). This scoping review aims to (1) identify the extent of the available evidence (2) provide an in-depth analysis of AI research methodology of the studies included in the review (3) Identify knowledge gaps pertaining to research in this area.\nThis review was performed according to the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA). We quantify the diagnostic accuracy of AI models in the field of TED assessment and appraise the quality of these studies using the modified QUADAS-2 tool.\nA total of 13 studies were included in this review. The most common AI models used in these studies are convolutional neural networks (CNN). The majority of the studies compared algorithm performance against healthcare professionals. The overall risk of bias and applicability using the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool led to most of the studies being classified as low risk, although higher deficiency was noted in the risk of bias in flow and timing.\nWhile the results of the review showed high diagnostic accuracy of the AI models in identifying features of TED relevant to disease assessment, deficiencies in study design causing study bias and compromising study applicability were noted. Moving forward, limitations and challenges inherent to machine learning should be addressed with improved standardized guidance around study design, reporting, and legislative framework.",

    "abstract": "The shortage of deceased donor organs has prompted the development of alternative liver grafts for transplantation. Living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has emerged as a viable option, expanding the donor pool and enabling timely transplantation with favorable graft function and improved long-term outcomes. An accurate evaluation of the donor liver's volumetry (LV) and anatomical study is crucial to ensure adequate future liver remnant, graft volume and precise liver resection. Thus, ensuring donor safety and an appropriate graft-to-recipient weight ratio. Manual LV (MLV) using computed tomography has traditionally been considered the gold standard for assessing liver volume. However, the method has been limited by cost, subjectivity, and variability. Automated LV techniques employing advanced segmentation algorithms offer improved reproducibility, reduced variability, and enhanced efficiency compared to manual measurements. However, the accuracy of automated LV requires further investigation. The study provides a comprehensive review of traditional and emerging LV methods, including semi-automated image processing, automated LV techniques, and machine learning-based approaches. Additionally, the study discusses the respective strengths and weaknesses of each of the aforementioned techniques. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including machine learning and deep learning, is expected to become a routine part of surgical planning in the near future. The implementation of AI is expected to enable faster and more accurate image study interpretations, improve workflow efficiency, and enhance the safety, speed, and cost-effectiveness of the procedures. Accurate preoperative assessment of the liver plays a crucial role in ensuring safe donor selection and improved outcomes in LDLT. MLV has inherent limitations that have led to the adoption of semi-automated and automated software solutions. Moreover, AI has tremendous potential for LV and segmentation; however, its widespread use is hindered by cost and availability. Therefore, the integration of multiple specialties is necessary to embrace technology and explore its possibilities, ranging from patient counseling to intraoperative decision-making through automation and AI.",

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is essential to initiate timely interventions, such as medication and lifestyle changes, preventing irreversible joint damage, reducing symptoms, and improving long-term outcomes for patients. Since magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the wrist and hand, in case of RA and MRI of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) in case of axSpA can identify inflammation before it is clinically discernible, this modality may be crucial for early diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, together with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have quickly evolved in the medical field, having an important role in improving diagnosis, prognosis, in evaluating the effectiveness of treatment and monitoring the activity of rheumatic diseases through MRI. The improvements of AI techniques in the last years regarding imaging interpretation have demonstrated that a computer-based analysis can equal and even exceed the human eye. The studies in the field of AI have investigated how specific algorithms could distinguish between tissues, diagnose rheumatic pathology and grade different signs of early inflammation, all of them being crucial for tracking disease activity. The aim of this paper is to highlight the implementation of AI models in MRI with focus on diagnosis of RA and axSpA through a literature review.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the development of a monitoring system designed to aid in the management and prevention of conditions related to urination. The system features an artificial intelligence (AI)-based recognition technology that automatically records a user's urination activity. Additionally, we developed a technology that analyzes movements to prevent neurogenic bladder.\nOur approach included the creation of AI-based recognition technology that automatically logs users' urination activities, as well as the development of technology that analyzes movements to prevent neurogenic bladder. Initially, we employed a recurrent neural network model for the urination activity recognition technology. For predicting the risk of neurogenic bladder, we utilized convolutional neural network (CNN)-based AI technology.\nThe performance of the proposed system was evaluated using a study population of 30 patients with urinary tract dysfunction, who collected data over a 60-day period. The results demonstrated an average accuracy of 94.2% in recognizing urinary tract activity, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the recognition technology. Furthermore, the motion analysis technology for preventing neurogenic bladder, which also employed CNN-based AI, showed promising results with an average accuracy of 83%.\nIn this study, we developed a urination disease monitoring system aimed at predicting and managing risks for patients with urination issues. The system is designed to support the entire care cycle of a patient by leveraging AI technology that processes various image and signal data. We anticipate that this system will evolve into digital treatment products, ultimately providing therapeutic benefits to patients.",

    "abstract": "The increasing use of insertable cardiac monitors (ICM) produces a high rate of false positive (FP) diagnoses. Their verification results in a high workload for caregivers. We evaluated the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based ILR-ECG Analyzer\u2122 (ILR-ECG-A). This machine-learning algorithm reclassifies ICM-transmitted events to minimize the rate of FP diagnoses, while preserving device sensitivity.\nWe selected 546 recipients of ICM followed by the Implicity\u2122 monitoring platform. To avoid clusterization, a single episode per ICM abnormal diagnosis (e.g. asystole, bradycardia, atrial tachycardia (AT)/atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachycardia, artefact) was selected per patient, and analyzed by the ILR-ECG-A, applying the same diagnoses as the ICM. All episodes were reviewed by an adjudication committee (AC) and the results were compared. Among 879 episodes classified as abnormal by the ICM, 80 (9.1%) were adjudicated as 'Artefacts', 283 (32.2%) as FP, and 516 (58.7%) as 'abnormal' by the AC. The algorithm reclassified 215 of the 283 FP as normal (76.0%), and confirmed 509 of the 516 episodes as abnormal (98.6%). Seven undiagnosed false negatives were adjudicated as AT or non-specific abnormality. The overall diagnostic specificity was 76.0% and the sensitivity was 98.6%.\nThe new AI-based ILR-ECG-A lowered the rate of FP ICM diagnoses significantly while retaining a > 98% sensitivity. This will likely alleviate considerably the clinical burden represented by the review of ICM events.",

    "abstract": "Background and aim Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) are\u00a0disorders where no organic clinical abnormalities are detected such as functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The brain activity of individuals with FD and IBS differs from that of healthy controls. Artificial intelligence can distinguish healthy controls from individuals with DGBI using several biomarkers. This study aimed to establish an artificial intelligence-based diagnostic support system using food preferences and brain activity in patients with DGBI. Methods ROME IV criteria were used to diagnose patients with FD and IBS. Their food preference was scored using a visual analog scale, and brain activity in the prefrontal cortex was investigated using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The diagnostic model was developed based on the brain activity and visual analog scale scores for food using an artificial neural network model. Results Forty-one participants, including 25 patients with DGBI were enrolled in the study. The accuracy of the artificial intelligence-based diagnostic model using an artificial neural network in differentiating between healthy controls and patients with DGBI and between healthy controls and those with FD were 72.3% and 77.1%, respectively. Conclusions The artificial intelligence-based diagnostic model using brain activity and preference to food images showed sufficiently high accuracy in distinguishing patients with DGBI from healthy controls, and those with FD from healthy controls.

    "abstract": "Diabetes Mellitus, one of the leading causes of death worldwide, has no cure to date and can lead to severe health complications, such as retinopathy, limb amputation, cardiovascular diseases, and neuronal disease, if left untreated. Consequently, it becomes crucial to be able to monitor and predict the incidence of diabetes. Machine learning approaches have been proposed and evaluated in the literature for diabetes prediction. This paper proposes an IoT-edge-Artificial Intelligence (AI)-blockchain system for diabetes prediction based on risk factors. The proposed system is underpinned by blockchain to obtain a cohesive view of the risk factors data from patients across different hospitals and ensure security and privacy of the user's data. We provide a comparative analysis of different medical sensors, devices, and methods to measure and collect the risk factors values in the system. Numerical experiments and comparative analysis were carried out within our proposed system, using the most accurate random forest (RF) model, and the two most used state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), using three real-life diabetes datasets. The results show that the proposed system predicts diabetes using RF with 4.57% more accuracy on average in comparison with the other models LR and SVM, with 2.87 times more execution time. Data balancing without feature selection does not show significant improvement. When using feature selection, the performance is improved by 1.14% for PIMA Indian and 0.02% for Sylhet datasets, while it is reduced by 0.89% for MIMIC III.",

    "abstract": "This work aims to optimize the physical education (PE) teaching effect based on deep learning (DL) to cultivate high-level college students better. Firstly, the present situation of college teachers' teaching ability is surveyed to realize the deficiencies in teaching. Secondly, an optimization algorithm is proposed to improve the node splitting mode. This algorithm can solve the problem of single and similar node splitting modes in the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The independent node splitting method Iterative Dichotomiser 3 and Classification and Regression Tree in the algorithm are recombined, and new splitting rules are obtained through adaptive parameter selection. Finally, the scheme designed is tested. The results suggest: The results suggest: (1) During the training of the proposed algorithm, although the loss curve at 4550 and 6800 points has a small crest, the error of the network loss function shows a downward trend and tends to be flat; (2) Compared with unoptimized Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Genetic Algorithm-Back Propagation (GA-BP), the proposed algorithm shows better performance both in terms of time consumption and accuracy (time consumption is less than 5.4\u00a0ms, and accuracy is more than 95\u00a0%). In a word, using the GA-BP-RF algorithm proposed to improve the PE teaching effect is feasible. The proposed model provides ideas for applying DL technology to improve teachers' teaching abilities.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the applicability of artificial intelligence-assisted compressed sensing (ACS) to anal fistula magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n51 patients were included in this study and underwent T2-weighted sequence of MRI examinations both with ACS and without ACS technology in a 3.0\u00a0T\u00a0MR scanner. Subjective image quality scores, and objective image quality-related metrics including scanning time, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), were evaluated and statistically compared between the images collected with and without ACS.\nNo significant difference in the subjective image quality of lesion conspicuity was observed between the two groups. However, ACS MRI decreased the acquisition time with regard to control group (74.00\u00a0s vs. 156.00\u00a0s). Besides, SNR of perianal and muscle in the ACS group was significantly higher than that of the control group (164.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033.35 vs 130.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029.10, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; 109.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.01 vs 87.61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.95, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; respectively). The CNR was significantly higher in the ACS group than in the control group (54.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.98 vs 43.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.00; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Moreover, the accuracy rate of the ACS groups in evaluating the direction and internal opening of the fistula was 88.89\u00a0%, exactly the same as that of the control group.\nWe demonstrated the applicability of using ACS to accelerate MR of anal fistulas with improved SNR and CNR. Meanwhile, the accuracy rates of the ACS group and the control were equivalent in evaluating the direction and internal opening of the fistula, based on the results of surgical exploration.",

    "abstract": "Childhood cognitive abilities are a predictor of health outcomes and adult income potential. Identifying factors associated with childhood intelligence and their interactions is essential in behavioral research. We assessed the impact of genetic variants and early child stimulation (ECS) on child intelligence and examined their possible interaction as potential modifiers of IQ in a population-based longitudinal study.\nParticipants of the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort study (N\u00a0=\u00a04231) underwent intelligent quotient (IQ) by WISC-III assessment at 6\u00a0years of age. At 24 and 48-months, mothers answered five ECS marker questions, whose sum was used to create a score. The polygenic score for intelligence (IQ-PGS) was constructed from the GWAS-weighted estimate of cognition. Association was assessed using multiple linear regression models adjusted for maternal, family, and child confounding variables. To explore the possible influence of skin color and ethnoracial classification, the regression models were stratified according to the skin color variable, as a sensitivity analysis.\nIn the adjusted analysis, IQ-PGS (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.79, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.26;1.31) as well as ECS (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a02.34; 95% CI: 1.76;2.92) were associated with IQ in this sample. The association between IQ-PGS and IQ was significant only in the white Brazilian group in the sensitivity analysis. However, there was no interaction between IQ-PGS and ECS on IQ (p\nECS did not modify the impact of genetic potential on intellectual development during childhood, suggesting that genetic factors and ECS exert independent effects on the IQ levels of children.",

    "abstract": "Primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is responsible for ~10,000 deaths annually in the United States. Stratification of risk of poor outcome (PO) including recurrence, metastasis and disease specific death (DSD) at initial biopsy would significantly impact clinical decision-making during the initial post operative period where intervention has been shown to be most effective. In this multi-institutional study, we developed a state-of-the-art self-supervised deep-learning approach with interpretability power and demonstrated its ability to predict poor outcomes of cSCCs at the time of initial biopsy. By highlighting histomorphological phenotypes, our approach demonstrates that poor differentiation and deep invasion correlate with poor prognosis. Our approach is particularly efficient at defining poor outcome risk in Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) T2a and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) T2 cSCCs. This bridges a significant gap in our ability to assess risk among T2a/T2 cSCCs and may be useful in defining patients at highest risk of poor outcome at the time of diagnosis. Early identification of highest-risk patients could signal implementation of more stringent surveillance, rigorous diagnostic work up and identify patients who might best respond to early postoperative adjunctive treatment.",

    "abstract": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may progress to ipsilateral invasive breast cancer (iIBC), but often never will. Because DCIS is treated as early breast cancer, many women with harmless DCIS face overtreatment. To identify these women that may forego treatment, we hypothesized that DCIS morphometric features relate to the risk of subsequent iIBC. We developed an artificial intelligence-based DCIS morphometric analysis pipeline (AIDmap) to detect DCIS as a pathologist and measure morphological structures in hematoxylin-eosin-stained (H&E) tissue sections. These were from a case-control study of patients diagnosed with primary DCIS, treated by breast-conserving surgery without radiotherapy. We analyzed 689 WSIs of DCIS of which 226 were diagnosed with subsequent iIBC (cases) and 463 were not (controls). The distribution of 15 duct morphological measurements in each H&E was summarized in 55 morphometric variables. A ridge regression classifier with cross validation predicted 5-years-free of iIBC with an area-under the curve of 0.65 (95% CI 0.55-0.76). A morphometric signature based on the 30 variables most associated with outcome, identified lesions containing small-sized ducts, low number of cells and low DCIS/stroma area ratio. This signature was associated with lower iIBC risk in a multivariate regression model including grade, ER, HER2 and COX-2 expression (HR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.28-0.78). AIDmap has potential to identify harmless DCIS that may not need treatment.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To evaluate the performance of a new artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool by comparing the quantified stenosis severity at coronary CT angiography (CCTA) with a reference standard derived from invasive quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Materials and Methods This secondary, post hoc analysis included 120 participants (mean age, 59.7 years \u00b1 10.8 [SD]; 73 [60.8%] men, 47 [39.2%] women) from three large clinical trials (AFFECTS, P3, REFINE) who underwent CCTA and invasive coronary angiography with QCA. Quantitative analysis of coronary stenosis severity at CCTA was performed using an AI-based coronary stenosis quantification (AI-CSQ) software service. Blinded comparison between QCA and AI-CSQ was measured on a per-vessel and per-patient basis. Results The per-vessel AI-CSQ diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 80%, 88%, 86%, 65%, and 94%, respectively, for diameter stenosis (DS) 50% or greater; and 78%, 92%, 91%, 47%, and 98%, respectively, for DS 70% or greater. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) to predict DS of 50% or greater and 70% or greater on a per-vessel basis were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.95; ",

    "abstract": "Due to the inefficiency and high cost of the current healthcare supply chain mode, in order to adapt to the great changes in the global economy and public health, it is urgent to choose an effective mode for sustainable development of healthcare supply chain. The aim of this paper is to use artificial intelligence systems to make intelligent decisions for healthcare supply chain mode selection.\nFirstly, according to the economic benefits, social benefits and environmental benefits of healthcare supply chain, this paper identifies different healthcare supply chain modes in combination with artificial intelligence technology. Secondly, this paper presents the intelligent choice optimization method of healthcare supply chain mode based on deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Finally, the effect of artificial intelligence in healthcare supply chain mode selection is verified by simulation experiment.\nThe experimental results show that healthcare supply chain mode selected by artificial intelligence is basically consistent with the target mode, while healthcare supply chain mode selected by the basic selection method, BP neural network method and big data method is different from the target mode, which indicates that AI has more advantages in the selection of medical supply chain mode. Therefore, we recommend the application of artificial intelligence to healthcare supply chain management. This study not only makes up for the ineffective problems of existing methods, but also makes up for the gaps in the application of AI technology in the field of healthcare supply chain. The scientific value of this paper is that the proposed framework and the artificial intelligence algorithm enrich the relevant theories of healthcare supply chain research and provide methodological guidance for intelligent decision-making of healthcare supply chain. At the same time, for medical enterprises, this research provides a new practical guideline for the application of artificial intelligence in the sustainable development and modern management of healthcare supply chain.",

    "abstract": "The role of P-wave in identifying left atrial enlargement (LAE) with the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiography (ECG) models is unclear. It is also unknown if AI-enabled single-lead ECG could be used as a diagnostic tool for LAE surveillance. We aimed to build AI-enabled P-wave and single-lead ECG models to identify LAE using sinus rhythm (SR) and non-SR ECGs, and compare the prognostic ability of severe LAE, defined as left atrial diameter \u2265 50 mm, assessed by AI-enabled ECG models vs echocardiography.\nThis retrospective study used data from 382,594 consecutive adults with paired 12-lead ECG and echocardiography performed within 2 weeks of each other at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. UNet++ was used for P-wave segmentation. ResNet-18 was used to develop deep convolutional neural network-enabled ECG models for discriminating LAE. External validation was performed with the use of data from 11,753 patients from another hospital.\nThe AI-enabled 12-lead ECG model outperformed other ECG models for classifying LAE, but the single-lead ECG models also showed excellent performance at a left atrial diameter cutoff of 50 mm. AI-enabled ECG models had excellent and fair discrimination on LAE using the SR and the non-SR data set, respectively. Severe LAE identified by AI-enabled ECG models was more predictive of future cardiovascular disease than echocardiography; however, the cumulative incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation and heart failure was higher in patients with echocardiography-severe LAE than with AI-enabled ECG-severe LAE.\nP-Wave plays a crucial role in discriminating LAE in AI-enabled ECG models. AI-enabled ECG models outperform echocardiography in predicting new-onset cardiovascular diseases associated with severe LAE.",

    "abstract": "To assess the performance, time-efficiency, and consistency of a convolutional neural network (CNN) based automated approach for integrated segmentation of craniomaxillofacial structures compared with semi-automated method for creating a virtual patient using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans.\nThirty CBCT scans were selected. Six craniomaxillofacial structures, encompassing the maxillofacial complex bones, maxillary sinus, dentition, mandible, mandibular canal, and pharyngeal airway space, were segmented on these scans using semi-automated and composite of previously validated CNN-based automated segmentation techniques for individual structures. A qualitative assessment of the automated segmentation revealed the need for minor refinements, which were manually corrected. These refined segmentations served as a reference for comparing semi-automated and automated integrated segmentations.\nThe majority of minor adjustments with the automated approach involved under-segmentation of sinus mucosal thickening and regions with reduced bone thickness within the maxillofacial complex. The automated and the semi-automated approaches required an average time of 1.1\u00a0min and 48.4\u00a0min, respectively. The automated method demonstrated a greater degree of similarity (99.6\u00a0%) to the reference than the semi-automated approach (88.3\u00a0%). The standard deviation values for all metrics with the automated approach were low, indicating a high consistency.\nThe CNN-driven integrated segmentation approach proved to be accurate, time-efficient, and consistent for creating a CBCT-derived virtual patient through simultaneous segmentation of craniomaxillofacial structures.\nThe creation of a virtual orofacial patient using an automated approach could potentially transform personalized digital workflows. This advancement could be particularly beneficial for treatment planning in a variety of dental and maxillofacial specialties.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to impact all facets of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management, including disease assessment, treatment decisions, discovery and development of new biomarkers and therapeutics, as well as clinician-patient communication.\nThis perspective paper provides an overview of the application of AI in the clinical management of IBD through a review of the currently available AI models that could be potential tools for prognosis, shared decision-making, and precision medicine. This overview covers models that measure treatment response based on statistical or machine-learning methods, or a combination of the two. We briefly discuss a computational model that allows integration of immune/biological system knowledge with mathematical modeling and also involves a 'digital twin', which allows measurement of temporal trends in mucosal inflammatory activity for predicting treatment response. A viewpoint on AI-enabled wearables and nearables and their use to improve IBD management is also included.\nAlthough challenges regarding data quality, privacy, and security; ethical concerns; technical limitations; and regulatory barriers remain to be fully addressed, a growing body of evidence suggests a tremendous potential for integration of AI into daily clinical practice to enable precision medicine and shared decision-making.\nAdvances in artificial intelligence (AI) show promise for improving treatment response prediction, decision-making, and precision medicine in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).In particular, AI could improve precision medicine for IBD by enabling identification of disease subtypes, prediction of disease progression and treatment response, selection of personalized treatments, and remote monitoring.Predictive models can benefit clinicians and patients alike by optimizing shared decision-making processes; patients can also use AI to cope with daily and long-term challenges of the disease.Beyond patients and practitioners, predictive models may positively impact healthcare structures and payers by enabling effective healthcare-resource utilization.To increase the accuracy and efficiency of AI models, biomarkers, patient-reported outcomes, and disease scores should be combined within predictive models, and the outputs should be compared with clinical trial data and real-world data for validation.",

    "abstract": "The attention level of students in a classroom can be improved through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. By automatically identifying the attention level, teachers can employ strategies to regain students' focus. This can be achieved through various sources of information. One source is to analyze the emotions reflected on students' faces. AI can detect emotions, such as neutral, disgust, surprise, sadness, fear, happiness, and anger. Additionally, the direction of the students' gaze can also potentially indicate their level of attention. Another source is to observe the students' body posture. By using cameras and deep learning techniques, posture can be analyzed to determine the level of attention. For example, students who are slouching or resting their heads on their desks may have a lower level of attention. Smartwatches distributed to the students can provide biometric and other data, including heart rate and inertial measurements, which can also be used as indicators of attention. By combining these sources of information, an AI system can be trained to identify the level of attention in the classroom. However, integrating the different types of data poses a challenge that requires creating a labeled dataset. Expert input and existing studies are consulted for accurate labeling. In this paper, we propose the integration of such measurements and the creation of a dataset and a potential attention classifier. To provide feedback to the teacher, we explore various methods, such as smartwatches or direct computers. Once the teacher becomes aware of attention issues, they can adjust their teaching approach to re-engage and motivate the students. In summary, AI techniques can automatically identify the students' attention level by analyzing their emotions, gaze direction, body posture, and biometric data. This information can assist teachers in optimizing the teaching-learning process.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a heterogeneous disease in which therapeutic strategies used have evolved dramatically. Despite significant progress in treatment strategies such as the development of anti-TNF drugs, it is still not possible to differentiate those patients who will respond from who will not. This can lead to effective-treatment delays and unnecessary costs. The aim of this study was to utilize a profile of the patient's characteristics, clinical parameters, immune status (cytokine profile) and artificial intelligence to assess the feasibility of developing a tool that could allow us to predict which patients will respond to treatment with anti-TNF drugs.\nThis study included 38 patients with RA from the RA-Paz cohort. Clinical activity was measured at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. The cytokines measured before the start of anti-TNF treatment were IL-1, IL-12, IL-10, IL-2, IL-4, IFNg, TNFa, and IL-6. Statistical analyses were performed using the Wilcoxon-Rank-Sum Test and the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The predictive model viability was explored using the 5-fold cross-validation scheme in order to train the logistic regression models.\nStatistically significant differences were found in parameters such as IL-6, IL-2, CRP and DAS-ESR. The predictive model performed to an acceptable level in correctly classifying patients (ROC-AUC 0.804167 to 0.891667), suggesting that it would be possible to develop a clinical classification tool.\nUsing a combination of parameters such as IL-6, IL-2, CRP and DAS-ESR, it was possible to develop a predictive model that can acceptably discriminate between remitters and non-remitters. However, this model needs to be replicated in a larger cohort to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence tools are being introduced in almost every field of human life, including medical sciences and medical education, among scepticism and enthusiasm.\nto assess how a generative language tool (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3.5, ChatGPT) performs at both generating questions and answering a neurosurgical residents' written exam. Namely, to assess how ChatGPT generates questions, how it answers human-generated questions, how residents answer AI-generated questions and how AI answers its self-generated question.\n50 questions were included in the written exam, 46 questions were generated by humans (senior staff members) and 4 were generated by ChatGPT. 11 participants took the exam (ChatGPT and 10 residents). Questions were both open-ended and multiple-choice.8 questions were not submitted to ChatGPT since they contained images or schematic drawings to interpret.\nformulating requests to ChatGPT required an iterative process to precise both questions and answers. Chat GPT scored among the lowest ranks (9/11) among all the participants). There was no difference in response rate for residents' between human-generated vs AI-generated questions that could have been attributed to less clarity of the question. ChatGPT answered correctly to all its self-generated questions.\nAI is a promising and powerful tool for medical education and for specific medical purposes, which need to be further determined. To request AI to generate logical and sound questions, that request must be formulated as precise as possible, framing the content, the type of question and its correct answers.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) technology to explore for automated medical record quality control methods, standardize the process for medical record documentation, and deal with the drawbacks of manually implemented quality control.\nIn this study, we constructed a medical record quality control system based on AI. We first designed and built, for the system, a quality control rule base based on authoritative standards and expert opinions. Then, medical records data were automatically collected through a data acquisition engine and were converted into structured data through a post-structured engine. Finally, the medical record quality control engine was combined with the rule base to analyze the data, identify quality problems, and realize automated intelligent quality control. This system was applied to the quality control of medical records and five quality control points were selected, including similarities in the history of the present illness, defects in the description of chief complaints, incomplete initial diagnosis, missing in formation in the history of menstruation, marriage, and childbirth, and mismatch between the chief complaints and the history of the present illness. We randomly selected 2 918 medical records of patients discharged in January 2022 to conduct AI quality control. Then we organized medical record quality control experts to conduct an accuracy review, made a comparison with previous manual quality control records, and analyzed the results. The number of quality problems that were verified in the accuracy review was taken as the gold standard and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn for the 5 quality control points.\nAccording to the accuracy review performed by medical record quality control experts, the accuracy of AI quality control reached 89.57%. For the sampled medical records, the results of AI quality control were compared with those of previous manually performed quality control and only one problem detected by manual quality control of the sampled medical records was not detected by the AI quality control system. The number of medical record quality problems correctly detected by AI quality control was about 2.97 times that of manual quality control. Analysis of the ROC curves showed that the \nThrough the application of medical record quality control system based on AI, efficient full quality control of medical record documentation can be achieved and the detection rate of quality problems can be effectively improved. In addition, the system helps save manpower and improve the quality of medical record documentation.\n\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u75c5\u5386\u8d28\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89c4\u8303\u75c5\u5386\u4e66\u5199\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u5de5\u8d28\u63a7\u5f0a\u7aef\u3002\n\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u75c5\u5386\u8d28\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u9996\u5148\u4f9d\u636e\u6743\u5a01\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u610f\u89c1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u8d28\u63a7\u89c4\u5219\u5e93\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u5f15\u64ce\u81ea\u52a8\u91c7\u96c6\u75c5\u5386\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f15\u64ce\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7531\u75c5\u5386\u8d28\u63a7\u5f15\u64ce\u7ed3\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u5e93\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u5224\u5b9a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u8d28\u63a7\u3002\u5c06\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u75c5\u5386\u8d28\u63a7\uff0c\u9009\u53d6\u73b0\u75c5\u53f2\u96f7\u540c\u3001\u4e3b\u8bc9\u63cf\u8ff0\u7f3a\u9677\u3001\u521d\u6b65\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0d\u5168\u3001\u6708\u7ecf\u5a5a\u80b2\u53f2\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u4e3b\u8bc9\u73b0\u75c5\u53f2\u4e0d\u5339\u914d5\u4e2a\u8d28\u63a7\u70b9\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u53d62022\u5e741\u6708\u76842 918\u4efd\u51fa\u9662\u75c5\u5386\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8d28\u63a7\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u5386\u8d28\u63a7\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u590d\u6838\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65e2\u5f80\u4eba\u5de5\u8d28\u63a7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u4ee5\u590d\u6838\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf95\u4e2a\u8d28\u63a7\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5de5\u4f5c\u7279\u5f81\uff08ROC\uff09\u66f2\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u3002\n\u6839\u636e\u75c5\u5386\u8d28\u63a7\u4e13\u5bb6\u590d\u6838\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8d28\u63a7\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523089.57%\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u62bd\u6837\u75c5\u5386\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8d28\u63a7\u548c\u65e2\u5f80\u4eba\u5de5\u8d28\u63a7\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u62bd\u6837\u75c5\u5386\u65e2\u5f80\u4eba\u5de5\u8d28\u63a7\u68c0\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4ec5\u67091\u4e2a\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8d28\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u672a\u68c0\u51fa\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8d28\u63a7\u6b63\u786e\u68c0\u51fa\u75c5\u5386\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u7ea6\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u8d28\u63a7\u76842.97\u500d\u3002ROC\u66f2\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u793a\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8d28\u63a7\u7ec4\u76845\u4e2a\u8d28\u63a7\u70b9\n\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u75c5\u5386\u8d28\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u75c5\u5386\u6587\u4e66\u5168\u91cf\u8d28\u63a7\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u68c0\u51fa\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8282\u7ea6\u4eba\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u75c5\u5386\u4e66\u5199\u8d28\u91cf\u3002",

    "abstract": "The medical profession has experienced a significant increase in the number of women practitioners in recent decades, leading to a reduction in the gender gap. According to the United States Medical Association, approximately 25% of physicians in the United States are now women. Although this progress is evident in the clinical setting, women's representation in academic medicine remains disproportionately low. The underrepresentation of women in academia has various consequences, including limited access to academic resources and hindered career growth. Previous studies have attempted to analyze these disparities, but results have been inconsistent, and the issue's complexity has not been fully understood. This study aims to examine the disparity in the gender of first authors in academic publications related to \" Artificial intelligence (AI) and Attention Deficit Hyperkinetic Disorder (ADHD)\"\u00a0between 2010 and 2023. Analysis was conducted on June 21st, 2023, using the database PubMed. The search term \"AI\" AND \"ADHD\" was used to derive all articles over a period of 13 years, from January 1st, 2010, to December 31st, 2022, excluding the year 2023 due to limited available publications. The relevant articles were downloaded in Microsoft Excel sheets. The gender of the first authors was determined using the NamSor app V.2, an application programming interface (API) with a large dataset of names and countries of origin. A total of 204 articles were considered for this study.\u00a0There were 78 female first authors\u00a0and 126\u00a0male first authors. The highest number of publications with a male first author occurred in 2022, with 32 publications. The Netherlands, Singapore, Turkey, and China have the highest gender ratios, indicating a more favourable representation of both genders. The p-value of 0.2664 suggests that there is no significant association between gender and country. The findings revealed a gender disparity, with a higher number of male first authors. By addressing and rectifying these disparities, we can enhance the overall quality, diversity, and inclusivity of research in the field of ADHD and Artificial Intelligence.",

    "abstract": "In our rapidly evolving world, technology stands at the forefront, driving remarkable advancements across various sectors. One of the most notable changes is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics in healthcare, starting a revolution that has the power to change women's health all over the world. Developed nations are already witnessing the benefits. However, a significant portion of the global population in underdeveloped regions is lagging behind, resulting in a noticeable disparity. This is particularly evident in women's healthcare, an area already facing global inequities. As we witness a digital revolution, we examine the progressive steps taken in women's healthcare. AI and robotics are key to this transformation. The services range from\u00a0using data to predict cancer trends to tailor-made medicine and technologies in reproduction. This editorial addresses the existing gaps and the digital divide, exploring the necessity for an inclusive approach in technology design and implementation to ensure equitable healthcare access.\u00a0 Furthermore, it highlights the imperative role of multi-sectoral collaborations to foster innovation while mitigating risks. The clear goal is to build a future where all women, no matter where they live, can get good healthcare, helped by AI and robotics, bringing in a time of healthcare for all. It's crucial for everyone involved to come together to make a healthcare system that everyone can use, helping women everywhere with the help of new technology.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to analyze the various influencing factors affecting the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled virtual assistants (VAs) for self-management of leukemia.\nA cross-sectional survey design is adopted in this study. The questionnaire included eight factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, behavioral intention, trust, perceived privacy risk, and personal innovativeness) affecting the acceptance of AI-enabled virtual assistants. A total of 397 leukemia patients participated in the online survey.\nPerformance expectancy (\u03bc = 3.14), effort expectancy (\u03bc = 3.05), and personal innovativeness (\u03bc = 3.14) were identified to be the major influencing factors of AI adoption. Statistically significant differences (p < .05) were observed between the gender-based and age groups of the participants in relation to the various factors. In addition, perceived privacy risks were negatively correlated with all other factors.\nAlthough there are negative factors such as privacy risks and ethical issues in AI adoption, perceived effectiveness and ease of use among individuals are leading to greater adoption of AI-enabled VAs.",

    "abstract": "Background This study aims to explore the factors associated with artificial intelligence (AI) and patient autonomy in obesity treatment decision-making. Methodology A cross-sectional, online, descriptive survey design was adopted in this study. The survey instrument incorporated the Ideal Patient Autonomy Scale (IPAS) and other factors affecting patient autonomy in the AI-patient relationship. The study participants included 74 physicians, 55 dieticians, and 273 obese patients. Results Different views were expressed in the scales AI knows the best (\u03bc = 2.95-3.15) and the patient should decide (\u03bc = 2.95-3.16). Ethical concerns (\u03bc = 3.24) and perceived privacy risks (\u03bc = 3.58) were identified as having a more negative influence on patient autonomy compared to personal innovativeness (\u03bc = 2.41) and trust (\u03bc = 2.85). Physicians and dieticians expressed significantly higher trust in AI compared to patients (p < 0.05). Conclusions Patient autonomy in the AI-patient relationship is significantly affected by privacy, trust, and ethical issues. As trust is a multifaceted factor and AI is a novel technology in healthcare, it is essential to fully explore the various factors influencing trust and patient autonomy.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into regenerative orthopedics heralds a paradigm shift in clinical methodologies and patient management. This review article scrutinizes AI's role in augmenting diagnostic accuracy, refining predictive models, and customizing patient care in orthopedic medicine. Focusing on innovations such as KeyGene and CellNet, we illustrate AI's adeptness in navigating complex genomic datasets, cellular differentiation, and scaffold biodegradation, which are critical components of tissue engineering. Despite its transformative potential, AI's clinical adoption remains in its infancy, contending with challenges in validation, ethical oversight, and model training for clinical relevance. This review posits AI as a vital complement to human intelligence (HI), advocating for an interdisciplinary approach that merges AI's computational prowess with medical expertise to fulfill precision medicine's promise. By analyzing historical and contemporary developments in AI, from the foundational theories of McCullough and Pitts to sophisticated neural networks, the paper emphasizes the need for a synergistic alliance between AI and HI. This collaboration is imperative for improving surgical outcomes, streamlining therapeutic modalities, and enhancing the quality of patient care. Our article calls for robust interdisciplinary strategies to overcome current obstacles and harness AI's full potential in revolutionizing patient outcomes, thereby significantly contributing to the advancement of regenerative orthopedics and the broader field of scientific research.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) describes the application of computer algorithms to the solution of problems that have traditionally required human intelligence. Although formal work in AI has been slowly advancing for almost 70\u2009years, developments in the last decade, and particularly in the last year, have led to an explosion of AI applications in multiple fields. Neuro-oncology has not escaped this trend. Given the expected integration of AI-based methods to neuro-oncology practice over the coming years, we set to provide an overview of existing technologies as they are applied to the neuropathology and neuroradiology of brain tumors. We highlight current benefits and limitations of these technologies and offer recommendations on how to appraise novel AI-tools as they undergo consideration for integration into clinical workflows.",

    "abstract": "Medical advancements in the diagnosis, surgical techniques, perioperative care, and continued care throughout childhood have transformed the outlook for individuals with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), improving survival and shifting the perspective towards lifelong care. However, with a growing population of survivors, longstanding challenges have been accentuated, and new challenges have surfaced, necessitating a re-evaluation of TOF care. Availability of prenatal diagnostics, insufficient information from traditional imaging techniques, previously unforeseen medical complications, and debates surrounding optimal timing and indications for reintervention are among the emerging issues. To address these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning holds great promise as they have the potential to revolutionize patient management and positively impact lifelong outcomes for individuals with TOF. Innovative applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning have spanned across multiple domains of TOF care, including screening and diagnosis, automated image processing and interpretation, clinical risk stratification, and planning and performing cardiac interventions. By embracing these advancements and incorporating them into routine clinical practice, personalized medicine could be delivered, leading to the best possible outcomes for patients. In this review, we provide an overview of these evolving applications and emphasize the challenges, limitations, and future potential for integrating them into clinical care.\nDe grandes avanc\u00e9es m\u00e9dicales touchant le diagnostic de la t\u00e9tralogie de Fallot (TF), les techniques chirurgicales, les soins p\u00e9riop\u00e9ratoires ainsi que les soins continus au cours de l\u2019enfance ont transform\u00e9 le pronostic de cette maladie et prolong\u00e9 la survie des patients, d\u2019o\u00f9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019adopter une approche th\u00e9rapeutique \u00e0 long terme. Compte tenu du nombre croissant de survivants, certains d\u00e9fis prennent une plus grande ampleur et de nouvelles difficult\u00e9s s\u2019y ajoutent. Il convient donc de r\u00e9\u00e9valuer les soins pour les patients atteints de TF. L\u2019acc\u00e8s limit\u00e9 au diagnostic pr\u00e9natal, les informations fragmentaires obtenues avec les techniques d\u2019imagerie traditionnelles, les complications m\u00e9dicales inattendues et les d\u00e9bats sur les indications et le moment appropri\u00e9 pour les interventions chirurgicales subs\u00e9quentes sont de nouveaux enjeux. Pour y faire face, l\u2019int\u00e9gration des outils d\u2019intelligence artificielle (IA) et d\u2019apprentissage automatique (AA) est prometteuse et pourrait r\u00e9inventer la prise en charge des patients atteints de TF en plus d\u2019am\u00e9liorer leurs r\u00e9sultats \u00e0 long terme. L\u2019utilisation innovante de l\u2019IA et de l\u2019AA touche de nombreux aspects des soins offerts \u00e0 ces patients, par exemple le d\u00e9pistage et le diagnostic, l\u2019analyse et l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation automatiques d\u2019images, la stratification du risque clinique de m\u00eame que la planification et la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019interventions cardiaques. L\u2019adoption de ces avanc\u00e9es technologiques et leur int\u00e9gration dans la pratique clinique courante ouvrent la voie \u00e0 une approche de m\u00e9decine personnalis\u00e9e dans l\u2019espoir d\u2019obtenir les meilleurs r\u00e9sultats possibles pour les patients. Notre article de synth\u00e8se pr\u00e9sente ces applications en pleine \u00e9volution et met en \u00e9vidence leurs perspectives d\u2019int\u00e9gration aux soins cliniques, mais aussi les d\u00e9fis et les limites qui accompagnent cette approche.",

    "abstract": "Environmental pollution caused by tetracycline antibiotics is a major concern of global public health. Here, a novel and portable molecularly imprinted electrochemiluminescence (MIECL) sensor based on smartphones for highly sensitive detection of chlortetracycline (CTC) has been successfully established. The high-performance ECL emitter of biomass carbon (BC) encapsulated CdZnTeS (CdZnTeS@BC) was successfully synthesized by hydrothermal. The enhanced ECL performance was ascribed to the introduction of the BC and increased the overall electrical conductivity of the nanoemitter, as well as increased the number of sulfur vacancies and doping on the surface of the emitter based on density functional theory calculations. An aniline-CTC molecular imprinted polymer was synthesized on the surface of the CdZnTeS@BC modified electrode by in-situ electropolymerization. The decrease in MIECL signal was attributed to the increase in impedance effect. The MIECL nanoplatform enabled a wide linear relationship in the range of 0.05-100\u00a0\u03bcmol/L with a detection limit of 0.029\u00a0\u03bcmol/L for spectrometer sensors. Interestingly, the light emitted during the MIECL reaction can be captured by a smartphone. Thus, machine learning was used to screen the photos that were taken, and color analysis was carried out on the screened photos by self-developed software, thus achieving a portable, convenient, and intelligent sensing mode. Finally, the sensor obtains satisfactory results in the detection of actual samples, with no significant differences from those of liquid chromatography.",

    "abstract": "To explore the possibility of automatic diagnosis of congenital heart disease (CHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with CHD (PAH-CHD) from chest radiographs using artificial intelligence (AI) technology and to evaluate whether AI assistance could improve clinical diagnostic accuracy.\nA total of 3255 frontal preoperative chest radiographs (1174 CHD of any type and 2081 non-CHD) were retrospectively obtained. In this study, we adopted ResNet18 pretrained with the ImageNet database to establish diagnostic models. Radiologists diagnosed CHD/PAH-CHD from 330/165 chest radiographs twice: the first time, 50% of the images were accompanied by AI-based classification; after a month, the remaining 50% were accompanied by AI-based classification. Diagnostic results were compared between the radiologists and AI models, and between radiologists with and without AI assistance.\nThe AI model achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.948 (sensitivity: 0.970, specificity: 0.982) for CHD diagnoses and an AUC of 0.778 (sensitivity: 0.632, specificity: 0.925) for identifying PAH-CHD. In the 330 balanced (165 CHD and 165 non-CHD) testing set, AI achieved higher AUCs than all 5 radiologists in the identification of CHD (0.670-0.858) and PAH-CHD (0.610-0.688). With AI assistance, the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard error AUC of radiologists was significantly improved for CHD (\u0394AUC\u00a0+\u00a00.096, 95\u00a0% CI: 0.001-0.190; P\u00a0=\u00a00.048) and PAH-CHD (\u0394AUC\u00a0+\u00a00.066, 95\u00a0% CI: 0.010-0.122; P\u00a0=\u00a00.031) diagnosis.\nChest radiograph-based AI models can detect CHD and PAH-CHD automatically. AI assistance improved radiologists' diagnostic accuracy, which may facilitate a timely initial diagnosis of CHD and PAH-CHD.",

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic surgical skill assessment and machine learning are often inaccessible to low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC). Our team developed a low-cost laparoscopic training system to teach and assess psychomotor skills required in laparoscopic salpingostomy in LMICs. We performed video review using AI to assess global surgical techniques. The objective of this study was to assess the validity of artificial intelligence (AI) generated scoring measures of laparoscopic simulation videos by comparing the accuracy of AI results to human-generated scores.\nSeventy-four surgical simulation videos were collected and graded by human participants using a modified OSATS (Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills). The videos were then analyzed via AI using 3 different time and distance-based calculations of the laparoscopic instruments including path length, dimensionless jerk, and standard deviation of tool position. Predicted scores were generated using 5-fold cross validation and K-Nearest-Neighbors to train classifiers.\nSurgical novices and experts from a variety of hospitals in Ethiopia, Cameroon, Kenya, and the United States contributed 74 laparoscopic salpingostomy simulation videos.\nComplete accuracy of AI compared to human assessment ranged from 65-77%. There were no statistical differences in rank mean scores for 3 domains, Flow of Operation, Respect for Tissue, and Economy of Motion, while there were significant differences in ratings for Instrument Handling, Overall Performance, and the total summed score of all 5 domains (Summed). Estimated effect sizes were all less than 0.11, indicating very small practical effect. Estimated intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of Summed was 0.72 indicating moderate correlation between AI and Human scores.\nVideo review using AI technology of global characteristics was similar to that of human review in our laparoscopic training system. Machine learning may help fill an educational gap in LMICs where direct apprenticeship may not be feasible.",

    "abstract": "Understanding noncognitive traits like emotional intelligence (EI) is valuable for radiography students, academics, practitioners, and educators. It helps them become aware of how these traits can impact their training, placements, and careers. This study aimed to evaluate the EI of radiography students at a tertiary institute in Harare, Zimbabwe.\nA quantitative cross-sectional study using a validated Trait EI questionnaire was conducted on students at a tertiary institute in Harare, Zimbabwe. Student t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Spearman's rho were employed for data analysis.\nA total of 84 radiography students were enrolled in this study. The students had relatively lower EI scores (4.31 +/-0.49) as compared to most of their global counterparts. A significant positive monotonic relationship was identified between age and self-control factor (Spearman's rho = 0.22, p = 0.04). There were no statistically significant differences in mean scores for the global and the four EI factors when stratified by gender, even though males had slightly higher scores than females in all but the emotionality factor. There were no significant differences in the mean scores of the global as well as the four factors by year of study.\nDeliberate, time-intensive curriculum interventions are needed to improve the EI of radiography students in Zimbabwe and this trend is potentially similar to other resource-limited settings. However, more context-specific evidence is needed to formulate the best techniques for EI interventions.",

Therefore, it is necessary to work on it.\nGene expression profiles and clinical features are collected from TCGA and GEO, and data analysis is performed in R4.2.0.\nThe ARGs-based no-supervised learning algorithm identifies three ARG subgroups, amongst which the prognosis is different.

    "abstract": "Deep-learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have outperformed even experienced dermatologists in dermoscopic melanoma detection under controlled conditions. It remains unexplored how real-world dermoscopic image transformations affect CNN robustness.\nTo investigate the consistency of melanoma risk assessment by two commercially available CNNs to help formulate recommendations for current clinical use.\nA comparative cohort study was conducted from January to July 2022 at the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Basel. Five dermoscopic images of 116 different lesions on the torso of 66 patients were captured consecutively by the same operator without deliberate rotation. Classification was performed by two CNNs (CNN-1/CNN-2). Lesions were divided into four subgroups based on their initial risk scoring and clinical dignity assessment. Reliability was assessed by variation and intraclass correlation coefficients. Excisions were performed for melanoma suspicion or two consecutively elevated CNN risk scores, and benign lesions were confirmed by expert consensus (n\u2009=\u20093).\n117 repeated image series of 116 melanocytic lesions (2 melanomas, 16 dysplastic naevi, 29 naevi, 1 solar lentigo, 1 suspicious and 67 benign) were classified. CNN-1 demonstrated superior measurement repeatability for clinically benign lesions with an initial malignant risk score (mean variation coefficient (mvc): CNN-1: 49.5(\u00b134.3)%; CNN-2: 71.4(\u00b122.5)%; p\u2009=\u20090.03), while CNN-2 outperformed for clinically benign lesions with benign scoring (mvc: CNN-1: 49.7(\u00b122.7)%; CNN-2: 23.8(\u00b129.3)%; p\u2009=\u20090.002). Both systems exhibited lowest score consistency for lesions with an initial malignant risk score and benign assessment. In this context, averaging three initial risk scores achieved highest sensitivity of dignity assessment (CNN-1: 94%; CNN-2: 89%). Intraclass correlation coefficients indicated 'moderate'-to-'good' reliability for both systems (CNN-1: 0.80, 95% CI:0.71-0.87, p\u2009<\u20090.001; CNN-2: 0.67, 95% CI:0.55-0.77, p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nPotential user-induced image changes can significantly influence CNN classification. For clinical application, we recommend using the average of three initial risk scores. Furthermore, we advocate for CNN robustness optimization by cross-validation with repeated image sets.\nClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04605822).",

    "abstract": "The choice of a scholarly journal, as opposed to a predatory journal, might impact a sport scientist's career negatively if the wrong choice is made, especially at an early stage of their research and publishing careers. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly impacting sport science and academia. In this study, we tested the accuracy and sensitivity of an AI-driven tool, applied specifically to sport science.\nOur research relies on the use of a new and free online AI-driven tool, the AJPC System, which claims the ability to distinguish \"normal\" (scholarly) from \"suspected predatory\" (unscholarly) journals.\nThe AJPC System was used to assess (1 December 2023) the classification of all ranked sport journals (n\u202f=\u202f124), namely those in all four quartiles (Q1-Q4) of SCImago Journal Rank (SJR), in the \"Sports Science\" category.\nThe AJPC System considered 47/124 journals to be \"suspected predatory\", mostly in Q4 journals (54.8\u202f% of total), casting a negative image on their academic standing.\nSport scientists are likely to consider SJR Q1-Q4 journals to be relatively safe to publish in, reliable and reputable, and might be confused with the \"suspected predatory\" label assigned to 37.9\u202f% of those journals. The AJPC System is thus misleading sport scientists.",

    "abstract": "Digital cytology and artificial intelligence (AI) are gaining greater adoption in the cytology laboratory. However, peer-reviewed real-world data and literature are lacking in regard to the current clinical landscape. The American Society of Cytopathology in conjunction with the International Academy of Cytology and the Digital Pathology Association established a special task force comprising 20 members with expertise and/or interest in digital cytology. The aim of the group was to investigate the feasibility of incorporating digital cytology, specifically cytology whole slide scanning and AI applications, into the workflow of the laboratory. In turn, the impact on cytopathologists, cytologists (cytotechnologists), and cytology departments were also assessed. The task force reviewed existing literature on digital cytology, conducted a worldwide survey, and held a virtual roundtable discussion on digital cytology and AI with multiple industry corporate representatives. This white paper, presented in 2 parts, summarizes the current state of digital cytology and AI practice in global cytology practice. Part 1 of the white paper is presented as a separate paper which details a review and best practice recommendations for incorporating digital cytology into practice. Part 2 of the white paper presented here provides a comprehensive review of AI in cytology practice along with best practice recommendations and legal considerations. Additionally, the cytology global survey results highlighting current AI practices by various laboratories, as well as current attitudes, are reported.",

    "abstract": "The evidence regarding the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in identifying dental implant systems is currently inconclusive. The available studies present varying results and methodologies, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.\nThe purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to comprehensively analyze and evaluate articles that investigate the application of AI in identifying and classifying dental implant systems.\nAn electronic systematic review was conducted across 3 databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus. Additionally, a manual search was performed. The inclusion criteria consisted of peer-reviewed studies investigating the accuracy of AI-based diagnostic tools on dental radiographs for identifying and classifying dental implant systems and comparing the results with those obtained by expert judges using manual techniques-the search strategy encompassed articles published until September 2023. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the quality of included articles.\nTwenty-two eligible articles were included in this review. These articles described the use of AI in detecting dental implants through conventional radiographs. The pooled data showed that dental implant identification had an overall accuracy of 92.56% (range 90.49% to 94.63%). Eleven studies showed a low risk of bias, 6 demonstrated some concern risk, and 5 showed a high risk of bias.\nAI models using panoramic and periapical radiographs can accurately identify and categorize dental implant systems. However, additional well-conducted research is recommended to identify the most common implant systems.",

    "abstract": "A common spine surgery procedure involves decompression of the lumbar spine. The impact of the surgeon's learning curve on relevant clinical outcomes is currently not well examined in the literature. A variety of machine learning algorithms have been investigated in this study to determine how a surgeon's learning curve and other clinical parameters will influence prolonged lengths of stay (LOS), extended operating times (OT), and complications, as well as whether these clinical parameters can be reliably predicted.\nA retrospective monocentric cohort study of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis treated with microsurgical (MSD) and full-endoscopic (FED) decompression was conducted. The study included 206 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis who underwent FED (63; 30.6%) and MSD (118; 57.3%). Prolonged LOS and OT were defined as those exceeding the 75th percentile of the cohort. Furthermore, complications were assessed as a dependent variable. Using unsupervised learning, clusters were identified in the data, which helped distinguish between the early learning curve (ELC) and the late learning curve (LLC). From 15 algorithms, the top five algorithms that best fit the data were selected for each prediction task. We calculated the accuracy of prediction (Acc) and the area under the curve (AUC). The most significant predictors were determined using a feature importance analysis.\nFor the FED group, the median number of surgeries with case surgery type at the time of surgery was 72 in the ELC group and 274 in the LLC group. FED patients did not significantly differ in outcome variables (LOS, OT, complication rate) between the ELC and LLC group. The random forest model demonstrated the highest mean accuracy and AUC across all folds for each classification task. For OT, it achieved an accuracy of 76.08% and an AUC of 0.89. For LOS, the model reached an accuracy of 83.83% and an AUC of 0.91. Lastly, in predicting complications, the random forest model attained the highest accuracy of 89.90% and an AUC of 0.94. Feature importance analysis indicated that LOS, OT, and complications were more significantly affected by patient characteristics than the surgical technique (FED versus MSD) or the surgeon's learning curve.\nA median of 72 cases of FED surgeries led to comparable clinical outcomes in the early learning curve phase compared to experienced surgeons. These outcomes seem to be more significantly affected by patient characteristics than the learning curve or the surgical technique. Several study variables, including the learning curve, can be used to predict whether lumbar decompression surgery will result in an increased LOS, OT, or complications. To introduce the provided prediction tools into clinics, the algorithms need to be implemented into open-source software and externally validated through large-scale randomized controlled trials.",

    "results": "For the FED group, the median number of surgeries with case surgery type at the time of surgery was 72 in the ELC group and 274 in the LLC group. FED patients did not significantly differ in outcome variables (LOS, OT, complication rate) between the ELC and LLC group. The random forest model demonstrated the highest mean accuracy and AUC across all folds for each classification task. For OT, it achieved an accuracy of 76.08% and an AUC of 0.89. For LOS, the model reached an accuracy of 83.83% and an AUC of 0.91. Lastly, in predicting complications, the random forest model attained the highest accuracy of 89.90% and an AUC of 0.94. Feature importance analysis indicated that LOS, OT, and complications were more significantly affected by patient characteristics than the surgical technique (FED versus MSD) or the surgeon's learning curve.",

    "abstract": "Utilization of electronic health records data to derive predictive indexes such as the electronic Child-Turcotte-Pugh (eCTP) Score can have significant utility in health care delivery. Within the records, CT scans contain phenotypic data which have significant prognostic value. However, data extractions have not traditionally been applied to imaging data. In this study, we used artificial intelligence to automate biomarker extraction from CT scans and examined the value of these features in improving risk prediction in patients with liver disease.\nUsing a regional liver disease cohort from the Veterans Health System, we retrieved administrative, laboratory, and clinical data for Veterans who had CT scans performed for any clinical indication between 2008 and 2014. Imaging biomarkers were automatically derived using the analytic morphomics platform. In all, 4614 patients were included. We found that the eCTP Score had a Concordance index of 0.64 for the prediction of overall mortality while the imaging-based model alone or with eCTP Score performed significantly better [Concordance index of 0.72 and 0.73 ( p <0.001)]. For the subset of patients without hepatic decompensation at baseline (n=4452), the Concordance index for predicting future decompensation was 0.67, 0.79, and 0.80 for eCTP Score, imaging alone, or combined, respectively.\nThis proof of concept demonstrates that the potential of utilizing automated extraction of imaging features within CT scans either alone or in conjunction with classic health data can improve risk prediction in patients with chronic liver disease.",

    "abstract": "Early detection of melanoma requires timely access to medical care. In this study, we examined the feasibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) to flag possible melanomas in self-referred patients concerned that a skin lesion might be cancerous.\nPatients were recruited for the study through advertisements in 2 hospitals in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Lesions of concern were initially examined by a trained medical student and if the study criteria were met, the lesions were then scanned using the FotoFinder System\nSeventeen confirmed malignancies were found, including 10 melanomas. Six melanomas were not flagged by the AI. These lesions showed ambiguous atypical melanocytic proliferations, and all were diagnostically challenging to the dermatologists and to the dermatopathologists. Eight malignancies were seen in patients with a family history of melanoma. The AI's ability to diagnose malignancy is not inferior to the dermatologists examining dermoscopic images.\nAI, used in this study, may serve as a practical skin cancer screening aid. While it does have technical and diagnostic limitations, its inclusion in a melanoma screening program, directed at those with a concern about a particular lesion would be valuable in providing timely access to the diagnosis of skin cancer.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant advancements in the medical domain in recent years. AI, an expansive field comprising Machine Learning (ML) and, within it, Deep Learning (DL), seeks to emulate the intricate operations of the human brain. It examines vast amounts of data and plays a crucial role in decision-making, overcoming limitations related to human evaluation. DL utilizes complex algorithms to analyze data. ML and DL are subsets of AI that utilize\u00a0hard statistical techniques that help machines consistently improve at tasks with experience. Pancreatic cancer is more common in developed countries and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality\u00a0worldwide. Managing pancreatic cancer remains a challenge despite significant advancements in diagnosis and treatment. AI has secured an almost ubiquitous presence in the field of oncological workup and management, especially in gastroenterology malignancies. AI is particularly useful for various investigations of pancreatic carcinoma because it has specific radiological features that enable diagnostic procedures without the requirement of a histological study. However, interpreting and evaluating resulting images is not always simple since images vary as the disease progresses. Secondly, a number of factors may impact prognosis and response to the treatment process. Currently, AI models have been created for diagnosing, grading, staging, and predicting prognosis and treatment response. This review presents the most up-to-date knowledge on the use of AI in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Background Eagle's syndrome is characterized by the anomalous elongation of the styloid process. This condition is usually identified through the manual evaluation of orthopantomogram (OPG) images, which is time-consuming and can have interobserver variability. The application of Artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology is gaining importance and interest in recent years. The application of AI in detecting styloid process elongation is less explored, advocating for research in the same arena. Aim and objectives The study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of artificial intelligence in detecting styloid process elongation in digital OPGs and to compare the performance of the three different AI algorithms with that of the manual radiographic evaluation by the radiologist. Materials and methods A total of 400 digital OPGs were screened, and linear measurements of the styloid process length (ImageJ software (National Institute of Health, Maryland, USA)) were done for the identification of styloid process elongation by a single calibrated observer to finally include a processed image dataset including 169 images of the elongated styloid process and 200 images of the normal styloid process.\u00a0A machine learning approach was used to detect the styloid process elongation using the three different AI models: logistic regression, neural network, and Na\u00efve Bayes algorithms in Orange software (University of Ljubljana, Slovenia). Performance evaluation was done using the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic) curve. Results Logistic regression and neural network algorithms depicted the highest accuracy of 100% with no false positives or false negatives, securing a score of 1.000 for all the metrics.\u00a0However, the Na\u00efve Bayes model demonstrated a fairly considerable accuracy, classifying 49 false positive images and 59 false negative images with an AUC (area under the curve) score of 78 %. Nevertheless, it performed better than random guessing. Conclusion Logistic regression and neural network algorithms accurately detected styloid process elongation similar to that of manual radiographic evaluation. The Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm did not perform an accurate classification yet performed better than random guessing. AI holds a promising scope for its application in automatically detecting styloid process elongation in digital OPGs.",

    "abstract": "It is important to diagnose cerebral infarction at an early stage and select an appropriate treatment method. The number of stroke-trained physicians is unevenly distributed; thus, a shortage of specialists is a major problem in some regions. In this retrospective design study, we tested whether an artificial intelligence (AI) we built using computer-aided detection/diagnosis may help medical physicians to classify stroke for the appropriate treatment.\nTo build the Stroke Classification and Treatment Support System AI, the clinical data of 231 hospitalized patients with ischemic stroke from January 2016 to December 2017 were used for training the AI. To verify the diagnostic accuracy, 151 patients who were admitted for stroke between January 2018 and December 2018 were also enrolled.\nBy utilizing multimodal data, such as DWI and ADC map images, as well as patient examination data, we were able to construct an AI that can explain the analysis results with a small amount of training data. Furthermore, the AI was able to classify with high accuracy (Cohort 1, evaluation data 88.7%; Cohort 2, validation data 86.1%).\nIn recent years, the treatment options for cerebral infarction have increased in number and complexity, making it even more important to provide appropriate treatment according to the initial diagnosis. This system could be used for initial treatment to automatically diagnose and classify strokes in hospitals where stroke-trained physicians are not available and improve the prognosis of cerebral infarction.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative Gait Analysis (QGA) is considered as an objective measure of gait performance. In this study, we aim at designing an artificial intelligence that can efficiently predict the progression of gait quality using kinematic data obtained from QGA. For this purpose, a gait database collected from 734 patients with gait disorders is used. As the patient walks, kinematic data is collected during the gait session. This data is processed to generate the Gait Profile Score (GPS) for each gait cycle. Tracking potential GPS variations enables detecting changes in gait quality. In this regard, our work is driven by predicting such future variations. Two approaches were considered: signal-based and image-based. The signal-based one uses raw gait cycles, while the image-based one employs a two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (2D FFT) representation of gait cycles. Several architectures were developed, and the obtained Area Under the Curve (AUC) was above 0.72 for both approaches. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to apply neural networks for gait prediction tasks.",

    "abstract": "Chronic Painful Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) are challenging to diagnose and manage due to their complexity and lack of understanding of brain mechanism. In the past few decades' neural mechanisms of pain regulation and perception have been clarified by neuroimaging research. Advances in the neuroimaging have bridged the gap between brain activity and the subjective experience of pain. Neuroimaging has also made strides toward separating the neural mechanisms underlying the chronic painful TMD. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming various sectors by automating tasks that previously required humans' intelligence to complete. AI has started to contribute to the recognition, assessment, and understanding of painful TMD. The application of AI and neuroimaging in understanding the pathophysiology and diagnosis of chronic painful TMD are still in its early stages. The objective of the present review is to identify the contemporary neuroimaging approaches such as structural, functional, and molecular techniques that have been used to investigate the brain of chronic painful TMD individuals. Furthermore, this review guides practitioners on relevant aspects of AI and how AI and neuroimaging methods can revolutionize our understanding on the mechanisms of painful TMD and aid in both diagnosis and management to enhance patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Non-anemic thalassemia trait (TT) accounted for a high proportion of TT cases in South China.\nTo use artificial intelligence (AI) analysis of erythrocyte morphology and machine learning (ML) to identify TT gene carriers in a non-anemic population.\nDigital morphological data from 76 TT gene carriers and 97 controls were collected. The AI technology-based Mindray MC-100i was used to quantitatively analyze the percentage of abnormal erythrocytes. Further, ML was used to construct a prediction model.\nNon-anemic TT carriers accounted for over 60% of the TT cases. Random Forest was selected as the prediction model and named TT@Normal. The TT@Normal algorithm showed outstanding performance in the training, validation, and external validation sets and could efficiently identify TT carriers in the non-anemic population. The top three weights in the TT@Normal model were the target cells, microcytes, and teardrop cells. Elevated percentages of abnormal erythrocytes should raise a strong suspicion of being a TT gene carrier. TT@Normal could be promoted and used as a visualization and sharing tool. It is accessible through a URL link and can be used by medical staff online to predict the possibility of TT gene carriage in a non-anemic population.\nThe ML-based model TT@Normal could efficiently identify TT carriers in non-anemic people. Elevated percentages of target cells, microcytes, and teardrop cells should raise a strong suspicion of being a TT gene carrier.",

    "abstract": "Rapid population ageing and associated health issues such as frailty are a growing public health concern. While early identification and management of frailty may limit adverse health outcomes, the complex presentations of frailty pose challenges for clinicians. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a potential solution to support the early identification and management of frailty. In order to provide a comprehensive overview of current evidence regarding the development and use of AI technologies including machine learning and deep learning for the identification and management of frailty, this protocol outlines a scoping review aiming to identify and present available information in this area. Specifically, this protocol describes a review that will focus on the clinical tools and frameworks used to assess frailty, the outcomes that have been evaluated and the involvement of knowledge users in the development, implementation and evaluation of AI methods and tools for frailty care in clinical settings.\nThis scoping review protocol details a systematic search of eight major academic databases, including Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Ageline, Web of Science, Scopus and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore using the framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley and enhanced by Levac \nSince this study is based on publicly available information, ethics approval is not required. Findings will be communicated with healthcare providers, caregivers, patients and research and health programme funders through peer-reviewed publications, presentations and an infographic.\nOSF Registries (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/T54G8).",

    "abstract": "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated exceptional performance in mitosis identification and quantification. However, the implementation of AI in clinical practice needs to be evaluated against the existing methods. This study is aimed at assessing the optimal method of using AI-based mitotic figure scoring in breast cancer (BC). We utilized whole slide images from a large cohort of BC with extended follow-up comprising a discovery (n\u00a0= 1715) and a validation (n\u00a0= 859) set (Nottingham cohort). The Cancer Genome Atlas of breast invasive carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) cohort (n\u00a0= 757) was used as an external test set. Employing automated mitosis detection, the mitotic count was assessed using 3 different methods, the mitotic count per tumor area (MCT; calculated by dividing the number of mitotic figures by the total tumor area), the mitotic index (MI; defined as the average number of mitotic figures per 1000 malignant cells), and the mitotic activity index (MAI; defined as the number of mitotic figures in 3 mm",

    "abstract": "Despite increased awareness of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), the diagnostic delay has remained stable over the past 3 decades. There is a need to improve the diagnostic performance and optimize resources allocation in the setting of EoE.\nWe developed and validated 2 point-of-care machine learning (ML) tools to predict a diagnosis of EoE before histology results during office visits.\nWe conducted a multicenter study in 3 European tertiary referral centers for EoE. We built predictive ML models using retrospectively extracted clinical and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) data collected from 273 EoE and 55 non-EoE dysphagia patients. We validated the models on an independent cohort of 93 consecutive patients with dysphagia undergoing EGDS with biopsies at 2 different centers. Models' performance was assessed by area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV). The models were integrated into a point-of-care software package.\nThe model trained on clinical data alone showed an AUC of 0.90 and a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.90, 0.75, 0.80, and 0.87, respectively, for the diagnosis of EoE in the external validation cohort. The model trained on a combination of clinical and endoscopic data showed an AUC of 0.94, and a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.94, 0.68, 0.77, and 0.91, respectively, in the external validation cohort.\nOur software-integrated models (https://webapplicationing.shinyapps.io/PointOfCare-EoE/) can be used at point-of-care to improve the diagnostic workup of EoE and optimize resources allocation.",

    "abstract": "Patients' perception of their bowel cleansing quality may guide rescue cleansing strategies before colonoscopy. The main aim of this study was to train and validate a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying rectal effluent during bowel preparation intake as \"adequate\" or \"inadequate\" cleansing before colonoscopy.\nPatients referred for outpatient colonoscopy were asked to provide images of their rectal effluent during the bowel preparation process. The images were categorized as adequate or inadequate cleansing based on a predefined 4-picture quality scale. A total of 1203 images were collected from 660 patients. The initial dataset (799 images), was split into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%). The second dataset (404 images) was used to develop a second test of the CNN accuracy. Afterward, CNN prediction was prospectively compared with the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) in 200 additional patients who provided a picture of their last rectal effluent.\nOn the initial dataset, a global accuracy of 97.49%, a sensitivity of 98.17% and a specificity of 96.66% were obtained using the CNN model. On the second dataset, an accuracy of 95%, a sensitivity of 99.60% and a specificity of 87.41% were obtained. The results from the CNN model were significantly associated with those from the BBPS (P<0.001), and 77.78% of the patients with poor bowel preparation were correctly classified.\nThe designed CNN is capable of classifying \"adequate cleansing\" and \"inadequate cleansing\" images with high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most accessible and comprehensive diagnostic tools used to assess cardiac patients at the first point of contact. Despite advances in computerized interpretation of the electrocardiogram (CIE), its accuracy remains inferior to physicians. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ECG system and compared its performance to current state-of-the-art CIE.\nAn AI-powered system consisting of 6 deep neural networks (DNN) was trained on standard 12\u2011lead ECGs to detect 20 essential diagnostic patterns (grouped into 6 categories: rhythm, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), conduction abnormalities, ectopy, chamber enlargement and axis). An independent test set of ECGs with diagnostic consensus of two expert cardiologists was used as a reference standard. AI system performance was compared to current state-of-the-art CIE. The key metrics used to compare performances were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and F1 score.\nA total of 932,711 standard 12\u2011lead ECGs from 173,949 patients were used for AI system development. The independent test set pooled 11,932 annotated ECG labels. In all 6 diagnostic categories, the DNNs achieved high F1 scores: Rhythm 0.957, ACS 0.925, Conduction abnormalities 0.893, Ectopy 0.966, Chamber enlargement 0.972, and Axis 0.897. The diagnostic performance of DNNs surpassed state-of-the-art CIE for the 13 out of 20 essential diagnostic patterns and was non-inferior for the remaining individual diagnoses.\nOur results demonstrate the AI-powered ECG model's ability to accurately identify electrocardiographic abnormalities from the 12\u2011lead ECG, highlighting its potential as a clinical tool for healthcare professionals.",

    "abstract": "Sleep and physical activity suggestions for panic disorder (PD) are critical but less surveyed. This two-year prospective cohort study aims to predict panic attacks (PA), state anxiety (SA), trait anxiety (TA) and panic disorder severity (PDS) in the upcoming week.\nWe enrolled 114 PD patients from one general hospital. Data were collected using the DSM-5, the MINI, clinical app questionnaires (BDI, BAI, PDSS-SR, STAI) and wearable devices recording daily sleep, physical activity and heart rate from 16 June 2020 to 10 June 2022. Our teams applied RNN, LSTM, GRU deep learning and SHAP explainable methods to analyse the data.\nThe 7-day prediction accuracies for PA, SA, TA, and PDS were 92.8\u00a0%, 83.6\u00a0%, 87.2\u00a0%, and 75.6\u00a0% from the LSTM model. Using the SHAP explainable model, higher initial BDI or BAI score and comorbidities with depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder or agoraphobia predict a higher chance of PA. However, PA decreased under the following conditions: daily average heart rate, 72-87 bpm; maximum heart rate, 100-145 bpm; resting heart rate, 55-60 bpm; daily climbing of more than nine floors; total sleep duration between 6\u00a0h 23\u00a0min and 10\u00a0h 50\u00a0min; deep sleep, >50\u00a0min; and awake duration, <53\u00a0min.\nModerate sample size and self-report questionnaires were the limitations.\nDeep learning predicts recurrent PA and various anxiety domains with 75.6-92.8\u00a0% accuracy. Recurrent PA decreases under adequate daily sleep and physical activity.",

    "abstract": "Traditional health care systems face long-standing challenges, including patient diversity, geographical disparities, and financial constraints. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care offers solutions to these challenges. AI, a multidisciplinary field, enhances clinical decision-making. However, imbalanced AI models may enhance health disparities.\nThis systematic review aims to investigate the economic performance and equity impact of AI in diagnostic imaging for skin, neurological, and pulmonary diseases. The research question is \"To what extent does the use of AI in imaging exams for diagnosing skin, neurological, and pulmonary diseases result in improved economic outcomes, and does it promote equity in health care systems?\"\nThe study is a systematic review of economic and equity evaluations following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and CHEERS (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) guidelines. Eligibility criteria include articles reporting on economic evaluations or equity considerations related to AI-based diagnostic imaging for specified diseases. Data will be collected from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and reference lists. Data quality and transferability will be assessed according to CHEC (Consensus on Health Economic Criteria), EPHPP (Effective Public Health Practice Project), and Welte checklists.\nThis systematic review began in March 2023. The literature search identified 9,526 publications and, after full-text screening, 9 publications were included in the study. We plan to submit a manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal once it is finalized, with an expected completion date in January 2024.\nAI in diagnostic imaging offers potential benefits but also raises concerns about equity and economic impact. Bias in algorithms and disparities in access may hinder equitable outcomes. Evaluating the economic viability of AI applications is essential for resource allocation and affordability. Policy makers and health care stakeholders can benefit from this review's insights to make informed decisions. Limitations, including study variability and publication bias, will be considered in the analysis. This systematic review will provide valuable insights into the economic and equity implications of AI in diagnostic imaging. It aims to inform evidence-based decision-making and contribute to more efficient and equitable health care systems.\nDERR1-10.2196/48544.",

    "abstract": "Lactulose-based hepatic encephalopathy treatment requires bowel movements/day titration, which is improved with Bristol stool scale (BSS) incorporation. Dieta app evaluates artificial intelligence (AI)-based BSS (AI-BSS) with stool images. Initially, controls (N = 13) and cirrhosis patients on lactulose/not on lactulose (n = 33) were trained on the app. They entered self-reported BSS (self-BSS) with AI-BSS communicated. Lactulose dose changes were tracked. A subset (n = 12) was retested with AI communication blocked. Most subjects were comfortable with the app. Self/AI-BSS and lactulose dose/AI-BSS correlation increased with app use. AI-BSS communications improved insight into self-BSS over time. Dieta app to gauge stool AI characteristics was acceptable and increased insight into lactulose dose and BSS in cirrhosis.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is paving the way in contemporary medical advances, with the potential to revolutionise orthopaedic surgical care. By harnessing the power of complex algorithms, artificial intelligence yields outputs that have diverse applications including, but not limited to, identifying implants, diagnostic imaging for fracture and tumour recognition, prognostic tools through the use of electronic medical records, assessing arthroplasty outcomes, length of hospital stay and economic costs, monitoring the progress of functional rehabilitation, and innovative surgical training via simulation. However, amid the promising potential and enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence, clinicians should understand its limitations, and caution is needed before artificial intelligence-driven tools are introduced to clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to explore the critical dimension of assessing the perceptions and readiness of hematologists to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in their diagnostic and treatment decision-making processes.\nThis study used a cross-sectional design for collecting data related to the perceptions and readiness of hematologists using a validated online questionnaire-based survey. Both hematologists (MD) and postgraduate MD students in hematology were included in the study. A total of 188 participants, including 35 hematologists (MD) and 153 MD hematology students, completed the survey.\nMajor challenges include \"AI's level of autonomy\" and \"the complexity in the field of medicine.\" Major barriers and risks identified include \"lack of trust,\" \"management's level of understanding,\" \"dehumanization of healthcare,\" and \"reduction in physicians' skills.\" Statistically significant differences in perceptions of benefits including resources (p=0.0326, p<0.05) and knowledge (p=0.0262, p<0.05) were observed between genders. Older physicians were observed to be more concerned about the use of AI compared to younger physicians (p<0.05).\nWhile AI use in hematology diagnosis and treatment decision-making is positively perceived, issues such as lack of trust, transparency, regulations, and poor AI awareness can affect the adoption of AI.",

    "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring owns important clinical value in diagnosis, prevention and rehabilitation of cardiovascular disease (CVD). With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI) and other advanced technologies, wearable ECG is playing an increasingly important role. With the aging process of the population, it is more and more urgent to upgrade the diagnostic mode of CVD. Using AI technology to assist the clinical analysis of long-term ECGs, and thus to improve the ability of early detection and prediction of CVD has become an important direction. Intelligent wearable ECG monitoring needs the collaboration between edge and cloud computing. Meanwhile, the clarity of medical scene is conducive for the precise implementation of wearable ECG monitoring. This paper first summarized the progress of AI-related ECG studies and the current technical orientation. Then three cases were depicted to illustrate how the AI in wearable ECG cooperate with the clinic. Finally, we demonstrated the two core issues-the reliability and worth of AI-related ECG technology and prospected the future opportunities and challenges.\n\u5fc3\u7535\u76d1\u6d4b\u5728\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u9884\u9632\u3001\u5eb7\u590d\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u968f\u7740\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u3001\u5927\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u7b49\u79d1\u6280\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7a7f\u6234\u5f0f\u5fc3\u7535\u6b63\u626e\u6f14\u7740\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u4f34\u968f\u4eba\u53e3\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u8fdb\u7a0b\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u9632\u6cbb\u6a21\u5f0f\u5347\u7ea7\u6108\u53d1\u7d27\u8feb\uff0c\u5229\u7528AI\u6280\u672f\u8f85\u52a9\u4e34\u5e8a\u89e3\u6790\u957f\u7a0b\u5fc3\u7535\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u8b66\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u667a\u6167\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u7a7f\u6234\u5f0f\u5fc3\u7535\u667a\u80fd\u76d1\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u76d1\u6d4b\u7ec8\u7aef\u548c\u4e91\u7aef\u7684\u534f\u540c\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u7684\u660e\u786e\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7a7f\u6234\u5f0f\u5fc3\u7535\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5fc3\u7535\u9886\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u7684AI\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u7a7f\u6234\u5f0f\u5fc3\u7535\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2dAI\u8ba1\u7b97\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5fc3\u7535AI\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014AI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u4e86\u5fc3\u7535AI\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u673a\u9047\u548c\u672a\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the performance of 6 generative artificial intelligence (AI) platforms on the learning objectives of medical arthropodology in a parasitology class in Korea. We examined the AI platforms\u2019 performance by querying in Korean and English to determine their information amount, accuracy, and relevance in prompts in both languages.\nFrom December 15 to 17, 2023, 6 generative AI platforms\u2014Bard, Bing, Claude, Clova X, GPT-4, and Wrtn\u2014were tested on 7 medical arthropodology learning objectives in English and Korean. Clova X and Wrtn are platforms from Korean companies. Responses were evaluated using specific criteria for the English and Korean queries.\nBard had abundant information but was fourth in accuracy and relevance. GPT-4, with high information content, ranked first in accuracy and relevance. Clova X was 4th in amount but 2nd in accuracy and relevance. Bing provided less information, with moderate accuracy and relevance. Wrtn\u2019s answers were short, with average accuracy and relevance. Claude AI had reasonable information, but lower accuracy and relevance. The responses in English were superior in all aspects. Clova X was notably optimized for Korean, leading in relevance.\nIn a study of 6 generative AI platforms applied to medical arthropodology, GPT-4 excelled overall, while Clova X, a Korea-based AI product, achieved 100% relevance in Korean queries, the highest among its peers. Utilizing these AI platforms in classrooms improved the authors\u2019 self-efficacy and interest in the subject, offering a positive experience of interacting with generative AI platforms to question and receive information.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) software in bone age (BA) assessment, according to the Greulich and Pyle (G&P) method in a German pediatric cohort.\nHand radiographs of 306 pediatric patients aged 1-18 years (153 boys, 153 girls, 18 patients per year of life)-including a subgroup of patients in the age group for which the software is declared (243 patients)-were analyzed retrospectively. Two pediatric radiologists and one endocrinologist made independent blinded BA reads. Subsequently, AI software estimated BA from the same images. Both agreements, accuracy, and interchangeability between AI and expert readers were assessed.\nThe mean difference between the average of three expert readers and AI software was 0.39 months with a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 6.8 months (1.73 months for the mean difference and 6.0 months for MAD in the intended use subgroup). Performance in boys was slightly worse than in girls (MAD 6.3 months vs. 5.6 months). Regression analyses showed constant bias (slope of 1.01 with a 95% CI 0.99-1.02). The estimated equivalence index for interchangeability was - 14.3 (95% CI -27.6 to - 1.1).\nIn terms of BA assessment, the new AI software was interchangeable with expert readers using the G&P method.\nThe use of AI software enables every physician to provide expert reader quality in bone age assessment.\n\u2022 A novel artificial intelligence-based software for bone age estimation has not yet been clinically validated. \u2022 Artificial intelligence showed a good agreement and high accuracy with expert radiologists performing bone age assessment. \u2022 Artificial intelligence showed to be interchangeable with expert readers.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have ushered in a new era of technological breakthroughs in healthcare. These technologies are revolutionizing the way we utilize medical data, enabling improved disease classification, more precise diagnoses, better treatment selection, therapeutic monitoring, and highly accurate prognostication. Different ML and DL models have been used to distinguish between electromyography signals in normal individuals and those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and myopathy, with accuracy ranging from 67% to 99.5%. DL models have also been successfully applied in neuromuscular ultrasound, with the use of segmentation techniques achieving diagnostic accuracy of at least 90% for nerve entrapment disorders, and 87% for inflammatory myopathies. Other successful AI applications include prediction of treatment response, and prognostication including prediction of intensive care unit admissions for patients with myasthenia gravis. Despite these remarkable strides, significant knowledge, attitude, and practice gaps persist, including within the field of electrodiagnostic and neuromuscular medicine. In this narrative review, we highlight the fundamental principles of AI and draw parallels with the intricacies of human brain networks. Specifically, we explore the immense potential that AI holds for applications in electrodiagnostic studies, neuromuscular ultrasound, and other aspects of neuromuscular medicine. While there are exciting possibilities for the future, it is essential to acknowledge and understand the limitations of AI and take proactive steps to mitigate these challenges. This collective endeavor holds immense potential for the advancement of healthcare through the strategic and responsible integration of AI technologies.",

    "abstract": "To develop a deep learning model, with the aid of ChatGPT, for thyroid nodules, utilizing ultrasound images. The\u00a0cytopathology of the fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) serves as the baseline.\nAfter securing IRB\u00a0approval, a retrospective study was conducted, analyzing thyroid ultrasound images and FNAB results from 1,061 patients between January 2017 and January 2022. Detailed examinations of their demographic profiles, imaging characteristics, and\u00a0cytological features were conducted. The images were used for training a deep learning model to identify various thyroid\u00a0pathologies. ChatGPT assisted in developing this model by aiding in code writing, preprocessing, model optimization, and\u00a0troubleshooting.\nThe model demonstrated an accuracy of 0.81 on the testing set, within a 95% confidence interval of\u00a00.76 to 0.87. It presented remarkable results across thyroid subgroups, particularly in the benign category, with high precision\u00a0(0.78) and recall (0.96), yielding a balanced F1-score of 0.86. The malignant category also displayed high precision (0.82) and\u00a0recall (0.92), with an F1-score of 0.87.\nThe study demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence, particularly\u00a0ChatGPT, in aiding the creation of robust deep learning models for medical image analysis.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess whether an artificial intelligence model based on facial expressions can accurately predict significant postoperative pain.\nA total of 155 facial expressions from patients who underwent gastric cancer surgery were analyzed to extract facial action units (AUs), gaze, landmarks, and positions. These features were used to construct various machine learning (ML) models, designed to predict significant postoperative pain intensity (NRS\u2009\u2265\u20097) from less significant pain (NRS\u2009<\u20097). Significant AUs predictive of NRS\u2009\u2265\u20097 were determined and compared to AUs known to be associated with pain in awake patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of the ML models was calculated and compared using DeLong's test.\nAU17 (chin raising) and AU20 (lip stretching) were found to be associated with NRS\u2009\u2265\u20097 (both P\u2009\u2264\u20090.004). AUs known to be associated with pain in awake patients did not show an association with pain in postoperative patients. An ML model based on AU17 and AU20 demonstrated an AUROC of 0.62 for NRS\u2009\u2265\u20097, which was inferior to a model based on all AUs (AUROC\u2009=\u20090.81, P\u2009=\u20090.006). Among facial features, head position and facial landmarks proved to be better predictors of NRS\u2009\u2265\u20097 (AUROC, 0.85-0.96) than AUs. A merged ML model that utilized gaze and eye landmarks, as well as head position and facial landmarks, exhibited the best performance (AUROC, 0.90) in predicting significant postoperative pain.\nML models using facial expressions can accurately predict the presence of significant postoperative pain and have the potential to screen patients in need of rescue analgesia.\nThis study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05477303; date: June 17, 2022).",

    "abstract": "We aimed to assess undergraduate medical students' knowledge, attitude, and perception regarding artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine.\nA multi-national, multi-center cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April 2022, targeting undergraduate medical students in nine Arab countries. The study utilized a web-based questionnaire, with data collection carried out with the help of national leaders and local collaborators. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of knowledge, attitude, and perception among the participants. Additionally, cluster analysis was employed to identify shared patterns within their responses.\nOf the 4492 students surveyed, 92.4% had not received formal AI training. Regarding AI and deep learning (DL), 87.1% exhibited a low level of knowledge. Most students (84.9%) believed AI would revolutionize medicine and radiology, with 48.9% agreeing that it could reduce the need for radiologists. Students with high/moderate AI knowledge and training had higher odds of agreeing to endorse AI replacing radiologists, reducing their numbers, and being less likely to consider radiology as a career compared to those with low knowledge/no AI training. Additionally, the majority agreed that AI would aid in the automated detection and diagnosis of pathologies.\nArab medical students exhibit a notable deficit in their knowledge and training pertaining to AI. Despite this, they hold a positive perception of AI implementation in medicine and radiology, demonstrating a clear understanding of its significance for the healthcare system and medical curriculum.\nThis study highlights the need for widespread education and training in artificial intelligence for Arab medical students, indicating its significance for healthcare systems and medical curricula.\n\u2022 Arab medical students demonstrate a significant knowledge and training gap when it comes to using AI in the fields of medicine and radiology. \u2022 Arab medical students recognize the importance of integrating AI into the medical curriculum. Students with a deeper understanding of AI were more likely to agree that all medical students should receive AI education. However, those with previous AI training were less supportive of this idea. \u2022 Students with moderate/high AI knowledge and training displayed increased odds of agreeing that AI has the potential to replace radiologists, reduce the demand for their services, and were less inclined to pursue a career in radiology, when compared to students with low knowledge/no AI training.",

    "abstract": "As the serrated pathway has gained prominence as an alternative colorectal carcinogenesis pathway, sessile serrated adenomas or polyps (SSA/P) have been highlighted as lesions to rule out during colonoscopy. These lesions are however morphologically difficult to detect on endoscopy and can be mistaken for hyperplastic polyps due to similar endoscopic features. With the underlying nature of rapid progression and malignant transformation, interval cancer is a likely consequence of undetected or overlooked SSA/P. Real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted colonoscopy via the computer-assisted detection system (CADe) is an increasingly useful tool in improving adenoma detection rate by providing a second eye during the procedure. In this article, we describe a guide through a video to illustrate the detection of SSA/P during AI-assisted colonoscopy.\nConsultant-grade endoscopists utilized real-time AI-assisted colonoscopy device, as part of a larger prospective study, to detect suspicious lesions which were later histopathologically confirmed to be SSA/P.\nAll lesions were picked up by the CADe where a real-time green box highlighted suspicious polyps to the clinician. Three SSA/P of varying morphology are described with reference to classical SSA/P features and with comparison to the features of the hyperplastic polyp found in our study. All three SSA/P observed are in keeping with the JNET Classification (Type 1).\nIn conclusion, CADe is a most useful aid to clinicians during endoscopy in the detection of SSA/P but must be complemented with factors such as good endoscopy skill and bowel prep for effective detection, and biopsy coupled with subsequent accurate histological diagnosis.",

In particular, memristor-based bionic tactile devices have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional characteristics of high flexibility, low power consumption, and adaptability. These devices provide advanced wearability and high-precision tactile sensing capabilities, thus emerging as an important research area within bioinspired electronics. This paper delves into the integration of memristors with other sensing and controlling systems and offers a comprehensive analysis of the recent research advancements in memristor-based bionic tactile devices. These advancements incorporate artificial nociceptors and flexible electronic skin (e-skin) into the category of bio-inspired sensors equipped with capabilities for sensing, processing, and responding to stimuli, which are expected to catalyze revolutionary changes in human-computer interaction. Finally, this review discusses the challenges faced by memristor-based bionic tactile devices in terms of material selection, structural design, and sensor signal processing for the development of artificial intelligence. Additionally, it also outlines future research directions and application prospects of these devices, while proposing feasible solutions to address the identified challenges.",

    "abstract": "Fifty per cent of patients with cancer require radiotherapy during their disease course, however, only 10%-40% of patients in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) have access to it. A shortfall in specialised workforce has been identified as the most significant barrier to expanding radiotherapy capacity. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based software has been developed to automate both the delineation of anatomical target structures and the definition of the position, size and shape of the radiation beams. Proposed advantages include improved treatment accuracy, as well as a reduction in the time (from weeks to minutes) and human resources needed to deliver radiotherapy.\nARCHERY is a non-randomised prospective study to evaluate the quality and economic impact of AI-based automated radiotherapy treatment planning for cervical, head and neck, and prostate cancers, which are endemic in LMICs, and for which radiotherapy is the primary curative treatment modality. The sample size of 990 patients (330 for each cancer type) has been calculated based on an estimated 95% treatment plan acceptability rate. Time and cost savings will be analysed as secondary outcome measures using the time-driven activity-based costing model. The 48-month study will take place in six public sector cancer hospitals in India (n=2), Jordan (n=1), Malaysia (n=1) and South Africa (n=2) to support implementation of the software in LMICs.\nThe study has received ethical approval from University College London (UCL) and each of the six study sites. If the study objectives are met, the AI-based software will be offered as a not-for-profit web service to public sector state hospitals in LMICs to support expansion of high quality radiotherapy capacity, improving access to and affordability of this key modality of cancer cure and control. Public and policy engagement plans will involve patients as key partners.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly popular in dentistry because it facilitates the process of diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, AI holds multiple prominent drawbacks, which restrict its wide application today. It is necessary for dentists to be aware of AI's pros and cons before its implementation.\nTherefore, the present study was conducted to comprehensively review various applications of AI in all dental branches along with its advantages and disadvantages.\nFor this review article, a complete query was carried out on PubMed and Google Scholar databases and the studies published during 2010-2022 were collected using the keywords \"Artificial Intelligence\", \"Dentistry,\" \"Machine learning,\" \"Deep learning,\" and \"Diagnostic System.\" Ultimately, 116 relevant articles focused on artificial intelligence in dentistry were selected and evaluated.\nIn new research AI applications in detecting dental abnormalities and oral malignancies based on radiographic view and histopathological features, designing dental implants and crowns, determining tooth preparation finishing line, analyzing growth patterns, estimating biological age, predicting the viability of dental pulp stem cells, analyzing the gene expression of periapical lesions, forensic dentistry, and predicting the success rate of treatments, have been mentioned. Despite AI's benefits in clinical dentistry, three controversial challenges including ease of use, financial return on investment, and evidence of performance exist and need to be managed.\nAs evidenced by the obtained results, the most crucial progression of AI is in oral malignancies' diagnostic systems. However, AI's newest advancements in various branches of dentistry require further scientific work before being applied to clinical practice. Moreover, the immense use of AI in clinical dentistry is only achievable when its challenges are appropriately managed.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a novel technology that has been widely acknowledged for its potential to improve the processes' efficiency across industries. However, its barriers and facilitators in healthcare are not completely understood due to its novel nature.\nThe purpose of this study is to explore the intricate landscape of AI use in family medicine, aiming to uncover the factors that either hinder or enable its successful adoption.\nA cross-sectional survey design is adopted in this study. The questionnaire included 10 factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, behavioral intention, trust, perceived privacy risk, personal innovativeness, ethical concerns, and facilitators) affecting the acceptance of AI. A total of 157 family physicians participated in the online survey.\nEffort expectancy (\u03bc = 3.85) and facilitating conditions (\u03bc = 3.77) were identified to be strong influence factors. Access to data (\u03bc = 4.33), increased computing power (\u03bc = 3.92), and telemedicine (\u03bc = 3.78) were identified as major facilitators; regulatory support (\u03bc = 2.29) and interoperability standards (\u03bc = 2.71) were identified as barriers along with privacy and ethical concerns. Younger individuals tend to have more positive attitudes and expectations toward\u00a0AI-enabled assistants compared to older participants (p < .05). Perceived privacy risk is negatively correlated with all factors.\nAlthough there are various barriers and concerns regarding the use of AI in healthcare, the preference for AI use in healthcare, especially family medicine, is increasing.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked interest in its integration into clinical medicine and education. This study evaluates the performance of three AI tools compared to human clinicians in addressing complex orthopaedic decisions in real-world clinical cases.\nTo evaluate the ability of commonly used AI tools to formulate orthopaedic clinical decisions in comparison to human clinicians.\nThe study used OrthoBullets Cases, a publicly available clinical cases collaboration platform where surgeons from around the world choose treatment options based on peer-reviewed standardised treatment polls. The clinical cases cover various orthopaedic categories. Three AI tools, (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, and Bard), were evaluated. Uniform prompts were used to input case information including questions relating to the case, and the AI tools' responses were analysed for alignment with the most popular response, within 10%, and within 20% of the most popular human responses.\nIn total, 8 clinical categories comprising of 97 questions were analysed. ChatGPT 4 demonstrated the highest proportion of most popular responses (proportion of most popular response: ChatGPT 4 68.0%, ChatGPT 3.5 40.2%, Bard 45.4%, \nWhile AI tools demonstrated potential use in educational contexts, their integration into clinical decision-making requires caution due to inconsistent responses and deviations from peer consensus. Future research should focus on specialised clinical AI tool development to maximise utility in clinical decision-making.\nIV.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to explore ChatGPT\u2019s (GPT-3.5 version) functionalities, including reinforcement learning, diverse applications, and limitations. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot powered by OpenAI\u2019s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model. The chatbot\u2019s applications span education, programming, content generation, and more, demonstrating its versatility. ChatGPT can improve education by creating assignments and offering personalized feedback, as shown by its notable performance in medical exams and the United States Medical Licensing Exam. However, concerns include plagiarism, reliability, and educational disparities. It aids in various research tasks, from design to writing, and has shown proficiency in summarizing and suggesting titles. Its use in scientific writing and language translation is promising, but professional oversight is needed for accuracy and originality. It assists in programming tasks like writing code, debugging, and guiding installation and updates. It offers diverse applications, from cheering up individuals to generating creative content like essays, news articles, and business plans. Unlike search engines, ChatGPT provides interactive, generative responses and understands context, making it more akin to human conversation, in contrast to conventional search engines\u2019 keyword-based, non-interactive nature. ChatGPT has limitations, such as potential bias, dependence on outdated data, and revenue generation challenges. Nonetheless, ChatGPT is considered to be a transformative AI tool poised to redefine the future of generative technology. In conclusion, advancements in AI, such as ChatGPT, are altering how knowledge is acquired and applied, marking a shift from search engines to creativity engines. This transformation highlights the increasing importance of AI literacy and the ability to effectively utilize AI in various domains of life.",

    "abstract": "In this synopsis, the editors of the Clinical Information Systems (CIS) section of the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics overview recent research and propose a selection of best papers published in 2022 in the CIS field.\nThe editors follow a systematic approach to gather relevant articles and select the best papers for the section. This year, they updated the query to incorporate the topic of telemedicine and removed search terms related to geographic information systems. The revised query resulted in a larger number of identified papers, necessitating the appointment of a third section editor to handle the increased workload. The editors narrowed the initial pool of articles to 15 candidate papers through a multi-stage selection process. At least seven independent reviews were collected for each candidate paper, and a selection meeting with the IMIA Yearbook editorial board led to the final selection of the best papers for the CIS section.\nThe query was carried out in mid-January 2023 and retrieved a deduplicated result set of 5,206 articles from 1,500 journals. This year, 15 papers were nominated as candidates, and four were finally selected as the best papers in the CIS section.Including telemedicine in the query resulted in a substantial increase in the number of papers found. The analysis highlights the growing convergence between clinical information systems and telemedicine, with mobile health (mHealth) technologies and data science applications gaining prominence. The selected candidate papers emphasize the practical impact of research efforts, focusing on patient-centric outcomes and benefits, including intelligent mobile health monitoring systems and AI-assisted decision-making in healthcare.\nLooking ahead, the field of CIS is expected to continue evolving, driven by advances in telemedicine, mHealth technologies, data science, and AI integration, leading to more efficient, patient-oriented, and intelligent healthcare systems and overall improvement of global healthcare outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Literature reviews are essential to the scientific process and allow clinician researchers to advance general knowledge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if the artificial intelligence (AI) programs ChatGPT and Perplexity.AI can perform an orthopedic surgery literature review.\nFive different search topics of varying specificity within orthopedic surgery were chosen for each search arm to investigate. A consolidated list of unique articles for each search topic was recorded for the experimental AI search arms and compared with the results of the control arm of two independent reviewers. Articles in the experimental arms were examined by the two independent reviewers for relevancy and validity.\nChatGPT was able to identify a total of 61 unique articles. Four articles were not relevant to the search topic and 51 articles were deemed to be fraudulent, resulting in 6 valid articles. Perplexity.AI was able to identify a total of 43 unique articles. Nineteen were not relevant to the search topic but all articles were able to be verified, resulting in 24 valid articles. The control arm was able to identify 132 articles. Success rates for ChatGPT and Perplexity. AI were 4.6% (6 of 132) and 18.2% (24 of 132), respectively.\nThe current iteration of ChatGPT cannot perform a reliable literature review, and Perplexity.AI is only able to perform a limited review of the medical literature. Any utilization of these open AI programs should be done with caution and human quality assurance to promote responsible use and avoid the risk of using fabricated search results. [",

    "abstract": "To predict the presence of angle dysgenesis on anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (ADoA) by using deep learning (DL) and to correlate ADoA with mutations in known glaucoma genes.\nIn total, 800 high-definition anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images were included, of which 340 images were used to build the machine learning (ML) model. Images used to build the ML model included 170 scans of primary congenital glaucoma (16 patients), juvenile-onset open-angle glaucoma (62 patients), and adult-onset primary open-angle glaucoma eyes (37 patients); the rest were controls (n = 85). The genetic validation dataset consisted of another 393 images of patients with known mutations that were compared with 320 images of healthy controls.\nADoA was defined as the absence of Schlemm's canal, the presence of hyperreflectivity over the region of the trabecular meshwork, or a hyperreflective membrane. DL was used to classify a given AS-OCT image as either having angle dysgenesis or not. ADoA was then specifically looked for on AS-OCT images of patients with mutations in the known genes for glaucoma.\nThe final prediction, which was a consensus-based outcome from the three optimized DL models, had an accuracy of >95%, a specificity of >97%, and a sensitivity of >96% in detecting ADoA in the internal test dataset. Among the patients with known gene mutations, ( MYOC, CYP1B1, FOXC1, and LTBP2 ) ADoA was observed among all the patients in the majority of the images, compared to only 5% of the healthy controls.\nADoA can be objectively identified using models built with DL.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a known cardiovascular risk factor and associated with higher postoperative complication rates in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In heart failure (HF), conflicting evidence in terms of survival has been reported, whereas sarcopenia is associated with poor prognosis. An increasing number of HF patients require left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantations. The postoperative mortality has improved in recent years but is still relatively high. The impact of body composition on outcome in this population remains unclear. The aim of this investigation was to examine the preoperative computed tomography (CT) body composition as a predictor of the postoperative outcome in advanced HF patients, who receive LVAD implantations.\nPreoperative CT scans of 137 patients who received LVADs between 2015 and 2020 were retrospectively analysed using an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered automated software tool based on a convolutional neural network, U-net, developed for image segmentation (Visage Version 7.1, Visage Imaging GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Assessment of body composition included visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue areas (VAT and SAT), psoas and total abdominal muscle areas and sarcopenia (defined by lumbar skeletal muscle indexes). The body composition parameters were correlated with postoperative major complication rates, survival and postoperative 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and quality of life (QoL).\nThe mean age of patients was 58.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.9\u00a0years; 122 (89.1%) were male. Most patients had severe HF requiring inotropes (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support [INTERMACS] profile I-III, 71.9%) secondary to coronary artery diseases or dilated cardiomyopathy (96.4%). Forty-four (32.1%) patients were obese (body mass index\u00a0\u2265\u00a030\u00a0kg/m\nPreoperative AI-based CT body composition identifies patients with poor outcome after LVAD implantation. Greater adipose tissue areas are associated with an increased risk for postoperative infections, in-hospital mortality and impaired 6MWD and QoL within 6\u00a0months postoperatively.",

    "abstract": "Waterborne illnesses are a significant concern worldwide. The management of water resources can be facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) with the help of data analytics, regression models, and algorithms. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations depends on understanding, communicating, and measuring the value of water and incorporating it into decision-making. Various barriers are used from the source to the consumer to prevent microbiological contamination of drinking water sources or reduce contamination to levels safe for human health. Infrastructure development and capacity-building policies should be integrated with guidelines on applying AI to problems relating to water to ensure good development outcomes. Communities can live healthily with such technology if they can provide clean, economical, and sustainable water to the ecosystem as a whole. Quick and accurate identification of waterborne pathogens in drinking and recreational water sources is essential for treating and controlling the spread of water-related diseases, especially in resource-constrained situations. To ensure successful development outcomes, policies on infrastructure development and capacity building should be combined with those on applying AI to water-related problems. The primary focus of this study is the use of AI in managing drinking water and preventing waterborne illness.",

    "abstract": "Chronic wounds contribute to significant healthcare and economic burden worldwide. Wound assessment remains challenging given its complex and dynamic nature. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods in wound analysis is promising. Explainable modelling can help its integration and acceptance in healthcare systems. We aim to develop an explainable AI model for analysing vascular wound images among an Asian population. Two thousand nine hundred and fifty-seven wound images from a vascular wound image registry from a tertiary institution in Singapore were utilized. The dataset was split into training, validation and test sets. Wound images were classified into four types (neuroischaemic ulcer [NIU], surgical site infections [SSI], venous leg ulcers [VLU], pressure ulcer [PU]), measured with automatic estimation of width, length and depth and segmented into 18 wound and peri-wound features. Data pre-processing was performed using oversampling and augmentation techniques. Convolutional and deep learning models were utilized for model development. The model was evaluated with accuracy, F1 score and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Explainability methods were used to interpret AI decision reasoning. A web browser application was developed to demonstrate results of the wound AI model with explainability. After development, the model was tested on additional 15\u2009476 unlabelled images to evaluate effectiveness. After the development on the training and validation dataset, the model performance on unseen labelled images in the test set achieved an AUROC of 0.99 for wound classification with mean accuracy of 95.9%. For wound measurements, the model achieved AUROC of 0.97 with mean accuracy of 85.0% for depth classification, and AUROC of 0.92 with mean accuracy of 87.1% for width and length determination. For wound segmentation, an AUROC of 0.95 and mean accuracy of 87.8% was achieved. Testing on unlabelled images, the model confidence score for wound classification was 82.8% with an explainability score of 60.6%. Confidence score was 87.6% for depth classification with 68.0% explainability score, while width and length measurement obtained 93.0% accuracy score with 76.6% explainability. Confidence score for wound segmentation was 83.9%, while explainability was 72.1%. Using explainable AI models, we have developed an algorithm and application for analysis of vascular wound images from an Asian population with accuracy and explainability. With further development, it can be utilized as a clinical decision support system and integrated into existing healthcare electronic systems.",

    "abstract": "Recently, membrane separation technology has been widely utilized in filtration process intensification due to its efficient performance and unique advantages, but membrane fouling limits its development and application. Therefore, the research on membrane fouling prediction and control technology is crucial to effectively reduce membrane fouling and improve separation performance. This review first introduces the main factors (operating condition, material characteristics, and membrane structure properties) and the corresponding principles that affect membrane fouling. In addition, mathematical models (Hermia model and Tandem resistance model), artificial intelligence (AI) models (Artificial neural networks model and fuzzy control model), and AI optimization methods (genetic algorithm and particle swarm algorithm), which are widely used for the prediction of membrane fouling, are summarized and analyzed for comparison. The AI models are usually significantly better than the mathematical models in terms of prediction accuracy and applicability of membrane fouling and can monitor membrane fouling in real-time by working in concert with image processing technology, which is crucial for membrane fouling prediction and mechanism studies. Meanwhile, AI models for membrane fouling prediction in the separation process have shown good potential and are expected to be further applied in large-scale industrial applications for separation and filtration process intensification. This review will help researchers understand the challenges and future research directions in membrane fouling prediction, which is expected to provide an effective method to reduce or even solve the bottleneck problem of membrane fouling, and to promote the further application of AI modeling in environmental and food fields.",

    "abstract": "Manual sleep staging (MSS) using polysomnography is a time-consuming task, requires significant training, and can lead to significant variability among scorers. STAGER is a software program based on machine learning algorithms that has been developed by Medibio Limited (Savage, MN, USA) to perform automatic sleep staging using only EEG signals from polysomnography. This study aimed to extensively investigate its agreement with MSS performed during clinical practice and by three additional expert sleep technicians. Forty consecutive polysomnographic recordings of patients referred to three US sleep clinics for sleep evaluation were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Three experienced technicians independently staged the recording using the electroencephalography, electromyography, and electrooculography signals according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines. The staging initially performed during clinical practice was also considered. Several agreement statistics between the automatic sleep staging (ASS) and MSS, among the different MSSs, and their differences were calculated. Bootstrap resampling was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals and the statistical significance of the differences. STAGER's ASS was most comparable with, or statistically significantly better than the MSS, except for a partial reduction in the positive percent agreement in the wake stage. These promising results indicate that STAGER software can perform ASS of inpatient polysomnographic recordings accurately in comparison with MSS.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is already considered one of the biggest global health crises. In Rio Grande do Norte, a Brazilian state, the RegulaRN platform was the health information system used to regulate beds for patients with COVID-19. This article explored machine learning and deep learning techniques with RegulaRN data in order to identify the best models and parameters to predict the outcome of a hospitalized patient. A total of 25,366 bed regulations for COVID-19 patients were analyzed. The data analyzed comes from the RegulaRN Platform database from April 2020 to August 2022. From these data, the nine most pertinent characteristics were selected from the twenty available, and blank or inconclusive data were excluded. This was followed by the following steps: data pre-processing, database balancing, training, and test. The results showed better performance in terms of accuracy (84.01%), precision (79.57%), and F1-score (81.00%) for the Multilayer Perceptron model with Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer. The best results for recall (84.67%), specificity (84.67%), and ROC-AUC (91.6%) were achieved by Root Mean Squared Propagation. This study compared different computational methods of machine and deep learning whose objective was to classify bed regulation data for patients with COVID-19 from the RegulaRN Platform. The results have made it possible to identify the best model to help health professionals during the process of regulating beds for patients with COVID-19. The scientific findings of this article demonstrate that the computational methods used applied through a digital health solution, can assist in the decision-making of medical regulators and government institutions in situations of public health crisis.",

    "abstract": "In the field of metastatic skeletal oncology imaging, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more prominent. Bone metastasis typically indicates the terminal stage of various malignant neoplasms. Once identified, it necessitates a comprehensive revision of the initial treatment regime, and palliative care is often the only resort. Given the gravity of the condition, the diagnosis of bone metastasis should be approached with utmost caution. AI techniques are being evaluated for their efficacy in a range of tasks within medical imaging, including object detection, disease classification, region segmentation, and prognosis prediction in medical imaging. These methods offer a standardized solution to the frequently subjective challenge of image interpretation.This subjectivity is most desirable in bone metastasis imaging. This review describes the basic imaging modalities of bone metastasis imaging, along with the recent developments and current applications of AI in the respective imaging studies. These concrete examples emphasize the importance of using computer-aided systems in the clinical setting. The review culminates with an examination of the current limitations and prospects of AI in the realm of bone metastasis imaging. To establish the credibility of AI in this domain, further research efforts are required to enhance the reproducibility and attain robust level of empirical support.",

    "abstract": "With an increasing number of patients with gastrointestinal cancer, effective and accurate early diagnostic clinical tools are required provide better health care for patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Recent studies have shown that artificial intelligence (AI) plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with gastrointestinal tumors, which not only improves the efficiency of early tumor screening, but also significantly improves the survival rate of patients after treatment. With the aid of efficient learning and judgment abilities of AI, endoscopists can improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment through endoscopy and avoid incorrect descriptions or judgments of gastrointestinal lesions. The present article provides an overview of the application status of various artificial intelligence in gastric and colorectal cancers in recent years, and the direction of future research and clinical practice is clarified from a clinical perspective to provide a comprehensive theoretical basis for AI as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic tool for gastrointestinal cancer.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is limited by need for real-time image interpretation expertise. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted Ultreon\u2122 2.0 software could address this barrier. We used eye tracking to understand how these software changes impact viewing efficiency and accuracy.\nEighteen interventional cardiologists and fellows at McMaster University, Canada, were included in the study and categorized as experienced or inexperienced based on lifetime OCT use. They were tasked with reviewing OCT images from both Ultreon\u2122 2.0 and AptiVue\u2122 software platforms while their eye movements were recorded. Key metrics, such as time to first fixation on the area of interest, total task time, dwell time (time spent on the area of interest as a proportion of total task time), and interpretation accuracy, were evaluated using a mixed multivariate model.\nPhysicians exhibited improved viewing efficiency with Ultreon\u2122 2.0, characterized by reduced time to first fixation (Ultreon\u2122 0.9\u2005s vs. AptiVue\u2122 1.6\u2005s, \nOur study demonstrated that AI-enabled Ultreon\u2122 2.0 software can streamline the image interpretation process and improve viewing efficiency for both inexperienced and experienced physicians. Enhanced viewing efficiency implies reduced cognitive load potentially reducing the barriers for OCT adoption in PCI decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone condition that occurs when bone mineral density and mass decrease. This makes the bones weak and brittle. The disorder is often undiagnosed and untreated due to its asymptomatic nature until the manifestation of a fracture. Machine Learning (ML) is extensively used in diverse healthcare domains to analyze precise outcomes, provide timely risk scores, and allocate resources. Hence, we have designed multiple heterogeneous machine-learning frameworks to predict the risk of Osteoporosis. An open-source dataset of 1493 patients containing bone density, blood, and physical tests is utilized. Thirteen distinct feature selection techniques were leveraged to extract the most salient parameters. The best-performing pipeline consisted of a Forward Feature Selection algorithm followed by a custom multi-level ensemble learning-based stack, which achieved an accuracy of 89\u00a0%. Deploying a layer of explainable artificial intelligence using tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive Values), LIME (Local Interpretable Model Explainer), ELI5, Qlattice, and feature importance provided interpretability and rationale behind classifier prediction. With this study, we aim to provide the holistic risk prediction of Osteoporosis and concurrently present a system for automated screening to assist physicians in making diagnostic decisions.",

    "abstract": "Patient care workflows are highly multimodal and intertwined: the intersection of data outputs provided from different disciplines and in different formats remains one of the main challenges of modern oncology. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the current clinical practice of oncology owing to advancements in digitalization, database expansion, computational technologies, and algorithmic innovations that facilitate discernment of complex relationships in multimodal data. Within oncology, radiation therapy (RT) represents an increasingly complex working procedure, involving many labor-intensive and operator-dependent tasks. In this context, AI has gained momentum as a powerful tool to standardize treatment performance and reduce inter-observer variability in a time-efficient manner. This review explores the hurdles associated with the development, implementation, and maintenance of AI platforms and highlights current measures in place to address them. In examining AI's role in oncology workflows, we underscore that a thorough and critical consideration of these challenges is the only way to ensure equitable and unbiased care delivery, ultimately serving patients' survival and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Clinical dermatoscopy and pathological slide assessment are essential in the diagnosis and management of patients with cutaneous melanoma. For those presenting with stage IIC disease and beyond, radiological investigations are often considered. The dermatoscopic, whole slide and radiological images used during clinical care are often stored digitally, enabling artificial intelligence (AI) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn, analyse and contribute to the clinical decision-making. A keyword search of the Medline database was performed to assess the progression, capabilities and limitations of AI and CNN and its use in diagnosis and management of cutaneous melanoma. Full-text articles were reviewed if they related to dermatoscopy, pathological slide assessment or radiology. Through analysis of 95 studies, we demonstrate that diagnostic accuracy of AI/CNN can be superior (or at least equal) to clinicians. However, variability in image acquisition, pre-processing, segmentation, and feature extraction remains challenging. With current technological abilities, AI/CNN and clinicians synergistically working together are better than one another in all subspecialty domains relating to cutaneous melanoma. AI has the potential to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of junior dermatology trainees, primary care skin cancer clinicians and general practitioners. For experienced clinicians, AI provides a cost-efficient second opinion. From a pathological and radiological perspective, CNN has the potential to improve workflow efficiency, allowing clinicians to achieve more in a finite amount of time. Until the challenges of AI/CNN are reliably met, however, they can only remain an adjunct to clinical decision-making.",

In this context, Developmental Toxicity (Dev Tox) stands as a key human health endpoint, especially significant for safeguarding maternal and child well-being.\nThis review outlines the existing methods employed in Dev Tox predictions and underscores the benefits of utilizing New Approach Methodologies (NAMs), specifically focusing on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which proves highly efficient in constructing reliable and transparent models aligned with recommendations from international regulatory bodies.\nThe limited availability of high-quality data and the absence of dependable Dev Tox methodologies render XAI an appealing avenue for systematically developing interpretable and transparent models, which hold immense potential for both scientific evaluations and regulatory decision-making.",

    "abstract": "PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) is an emerging technology in chemical biology and drug discovery. This technique facilitates the complete removal of the target proteins that are \"undruggable\" or challenging to target through chemical molecules via the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS). PROTACs have been widely explored and outperformed not only in cancer but also in other diseases. During the past few decades, several academic institutes and pharma companies have poured more efforts into PROTAC-related technologies, setting the stage for several major degrader trial readouts in clinical phases. Despite their promising results, the formation of robust ternary orientation, off-target activity, poor permeability, and binding affinity are some of the limitations that hinder their development. Recent advancements in computational technologies have facilitated progress in the development of PROTACs. Researchers have been able to utilize these technologies to explore a wider range of E3 ligases and optimize linkers, thereby gaining a better understanding of the effectiveness and safety of PROTACs in clinical settings. In this review, we briefly explore the computational strategies reported to date for the formation of PROTAC components and discuss the key challenges and opportunities for further research in this area.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a condition that affects 50 million individuals globally, significantly impacting their quality of life. Epileptic seizures, a transient occurrence, are characterized by a spectrum of manifestations, including alterations in motor function and consciousness. These events impose restrictions on the daily lives of those affected, frequently resulting in social isolation and psychological distress. In response, numerous efforts have been directed towards the detection and prevention of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis, employing machine learning and deep learning methodologies. This study presents a methodology that reduces the number of features and channels required by simpler classifiers, leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for the detection of epileptic seizures. The proposed approach achieves performance metrics exceeding 95% in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score by utilizing merely six features and five channels in a temporal domain analysis, with a time window of 1 s. The model demonstrates robust generalization across the patient cohort included in the database, suggesting that feature reduction in simpler models-without resorting to deep learning-is adequate for seizure detection. The research underscores the potential for substantial reductions in the number of attributes and channels, advocating for the training of models with strategically selected electrodes, and thereby supporting the development of effective mobile applications for epileptic seizure detection.",

Recently, special attention has been devoted on the clinical setting, where breakdowns in teamwork, leadership, and communication can lead to adverse events, compromising patient safety. So far, researchers have mostly relied on surveys to study human behavior and group dynamics; however, this method is ineffective. In contrast, a promising solution to monitor behavioral and individual features that are reflective of CI is represented by wearable technologies. To date, the field of CI assessment still appears unstructured; therefore, the aim of this narrative review is to provide a detailed overview of the main group and individual parameters that can be monitored to evaluate CI in clinical settings, together with the wearables either already used to assess them or that have the potential to be applied in this scenario. The working principles, advantages, and disadvantages of each device are introduced in order to try to bring order in this field and provide a guide for future CI investigations in medical contexts.",

    "abstract": "Open-source artificial intelligence models are finding free application in various industries, including computer science and medicine. Their clinical potential, especially in assisting diagnosis and therapy, is the subject of increasingly intensive research. Due to the growing interest in AI for diagnostics, we conducted a study evaluating the abilities of AI models, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing, and Scholar AI, in classifying single-curve scoliosis based on radiological descriptions. Fifty-six posturographic images depicting single-curve scoliosis were selected and assessed by two independent neurosurgery specialists, who classified them as mild, moderate, or severe based on Cobb angles. Subsequently, descriptions were developed that accurately characterized the degree of spinal deformation, based on the measured values of Cobb angles. These descriptions were then provided to AI language models to assess their proficiency in diagnosing spinal pathologies. The artificial intelligence models conducted classification using the provided data. Our study also focused on identifying specific sources of information and criteria applied in their decision-making algorithms, aiming for a deeper understanding of the determinants influencing AI decision processes in scoliosis classification. The classification quality of the predictions was evaluated using performance evaluation metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy, and balanced accuracy. Our study strongly supported our hypothesis, showing that among four AI models, ChatGPT 4 and Scholar AI Premium excelled in classifying single-curve scoliosis with perfect sensitivity and specificity. These models demonstrated unmatched rater concordance and excellent performance metrics. In comparing real and AI-generated scoliosis classifications, they showed impeccable precision in all posturographic images, indicating total accuracy (1.0, MAE = 0.0) and remarkable inter-rater agreement, with a perfect Fleiss' Kappa score. This was consistent across scoliosis cases with a Cobb's angle range of 11-92 degrees. Despite high accuracy in classification, each model used an incorrect angular range for the mild stage of scoliosis. Our findings highlight the immense potential of AI in analyzing medical data sets. However, the diversity in competencies of AI models indicates the need for their further development to more effectively meet specific needs in clinical practice.",

The paper exposes an overview of the applications of artificial intelligence in deriving prognostic information related to the prediction of survival and recurrence and how these data may have a potential impact on the choice of therapeutic strategy, making it increasingly personalized. This systematic review was written following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs) are often not reported by radiologists on routine chest radiographs. This study aims to investigate the clinical value of a newly developed artificial intelligence (AI) tool, Ofeye 1.0, for automated detection of OVFs on lateral chest radiographs in post-menopausal women (>60 years) who were referred to undergo chest x-rays for other reasons. A total of 510 de-identified lateral chest radiographs from three clinical sites were retrieved and analysed using the Ofeye 1.0 tool. These images were then reviewed by a consultant radiologist with findings serving as the reference standard for determining the diagnostic performance of the AI tool for the detection of OVFs. Of all the original radiologist reports, missed OVFs were found in 28.8% of images but were detected using the AI tool. The AI tool demonstrated high specificity of 92.8% (95% CI: 89.6, 95.2%), moderate accuracy of 80.3% (95% CI: 76.3, 80.4%), positive predictive value (PPV) of 73.7% (95% CI: 65.2, 80.8%), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 81.5% (95% CI: 79, 83.8%), but low sensitivity of 49% (95% CI: 40.7, 57.3%). The AI tool showed improved sensitivity compared with the original radiologist reports, which was 20.8% (95% CI: 14.5, 28.4). The new AI tool can be used as a complementary tool in routine diagnostic reports for the reduction in missed OVFs in elderly women.",

Despite molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) has achieved a primary role in the characterization of MM, it is not free from shortcomings. In recent years, radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, have played an important role in mining additional information from medical images beyond human eyes' resolving power. Our review provides a summary of the current status of radiomics and AI in different clinical contexts of MM. A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus was conducted, including all the articles published in English that explored radiomics and AI analyses of PET/CT images in MM. The initial results have highlighted the potential role of such new features in order to improve the clinical stratification of MM patients, as well as to increase their clinical benefits. However, more studies are warranted before these approaches can be implemented in clinical routines.",

    "abstract": "We sought to prospectively investigate the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment using a hand-held ultrasound device (HUD) in COVID-19 patients and to examine whether reduced LVEF predicts the composite endpoint of in-hospital death, advanced ventilatory support, shock, myocardial injury, and acute decompensated heart failure. COVID-19 patients were evaluated with a real-time LVEF assessment using an HUD equipped with an AI-based tool vs. assessment by a blinded fellowship-trained echocardiographer. Among 42 patients, those with LVEF < 50% were older with more comorbidities and unfavorable exam characteristics. An excellent correlation was demonstrated between the AI and the echocardiographer LVEF assessment (0.774, ",

    "abstract": "Down syndrome arises from chromosomal non-disjunction during gametogenesis, resulting in an additional chromosome. This anomaly presents with intellectual impairment, growth limitations, and distinct facial features. Positive correlation exists between maternal age, particularly in advanced cases, and the global annual incidence is over 200,000 cases. Early interventions, including first and second-trimester screenings, have improved DS diagnosis and care. The manifestations of Down syndrome result from complex interactions between genetic factors linked to various health concerns. To explore recent advancements in Down syndrome research, we focus on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies for improved diagnosis and management. Recent developments leverage AI and ML algorithms to detect subtle Down syndrome indicators across various data sources, including biological markers, facial traits, and medical images. These technologies offer potential enhancements in accuracy, particularly in cases complicated by cognitive impairments. Integration of AI and ML in Down syndrome diagnosis signifies a significant advancement in medical science. These tools hold promise for early detection, personalized treatment, and a deeper comprehension of the complex interplay between genetics and environmental factors. This review provides a comprehensive overview of neurodevelopmental and cognitive profiles, comorbidities, diagnosis, and management within the Down syndrome context. The utilization of AI and ML represents a transformative step toward enhancing early identification and tailored interventions for individuals with Down syndrome, ultimately improving their quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Insulin is a powerful pleiotropic hormone that affects processes such as cell growth, energy expenditure, and carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism. The molecular mechanisms by which insulin regulates muscle metabolism and the underlying defects that cause insulin resistance have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to perform a microarray data analysis to find differentially expressed genes. The analysis has been based on the data of a study deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the identifier \"GSE22309\". The selected data contain samples from three types of patients after taking insulin treatment: patients with diabetes (DB), patients with insulin sensitivity (IS), and patients with insulin resistance (IR). Through an analysis of omics data, 20 genes were found to be differentially expressed (DEG) between the three possible comparisons obtained (DB vs. IS, DB vs. IR, and IS vs. IR); these data sets have been used to develop predictive models through machine learning (ML) techniques to classify patients with respect to the three categories mentioned previously. All the ML techniques present an accuracy superior to 80%, reaching almost 90% when unifying IR and DB categories.",

    "abstract": "Real-time performance and reliability are two critical indicators in cyber-physical production systems (CPPS). To meet strict requirements in terms of these indicators, it is necessary to solve complex job-shop scheduling problems (JSPs) and reserve considerable redundant resources for unexpected jobs before production. However, traditional job-shop methods are difficult to apply under dynamic conditions due to the uncertain time cost of transmission and computation. Edge computing offers an efficient solution to this issue. By deploying edge servers around the equipment, smart factories can achieve localized decisions based on computational intelligence (CI) methods offloaded from the cloud. Most works on edge computing have studied task offloading and dispatching scheduling based on CI. However, few of the existing methods can be used for behavior-level control due to the corresponding requirements for ultralow latency (10 ms) and ultrahigh reliability (99.9999% in wireless transmission), especially when unexpected computing jobs arise. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic resource prediction scheduling (DRPS) method based on CI to achieve real-time localized behavior-level control. The proposed DRPS method primarily focuses on the schedulability of unexpected computing jobs, and its core ideas are (1) to predict job arrival times based on a backpropagation neural network and (2) to perform real-time migration in the form of human-computer interaction based on the results of resource analysis. An experimental comparison with existing schemes shows that our DRPS method improves the acceptance ratio by 25.9% compared to the earliest deadline first scheme.",

    "abstract": "Accurate preoperative planning for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is crucial. Computed tomography (CT)-based preoperative planning offers more comprehensive information and can also be used to design patient-specific instrumentation (PSI), but it requires well-reconstructed and segmented images, and the process is complex and time-consuming. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) preoperative planning and PSI system for TKA and to validate its time savings and accuracy in clinical applications.\nThe 3D-UNet and modified HRNet neural network structures were used to develop the AI preoperative planning and PSI system (AIJOINT). Forty-two patients who were scheduled for TKA underwent both AI and manual CT processing and planning for component sizing, 20 of whom had their PSIs designed and applied intraoperatively. The time consumed and the size and orientation of the postoperative component were recorded.\nThe Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and loss function indicated excellent performance of the neural network structure in CT image segmentation.

    "abstract": "Perceptual and statistical evidence has highlighted voice characteristics of individuals affected by genetic syndromes that differ from those of normophonic subjects. In this paper, we propose a procedure for systematically collecting such pathological voices and developing AI-based automated tools to support differential diagnosis. Guidelines on the most appropriate recording devices, vocal tasks, and acoustical parameters are provided to simplify, speed up, and make the whole procedure homogeneous and reproducible. The proposed procedure was applied to a group of 56 subjects affected by Costello syndrome (CS), Down syndrome (DS), Noonan syndrome (NS), and Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS). The entire database was divided into three groups: pediatric subjects (PS; individuals < 12 years of age), female adults (FA), and male adults (MA). In line with the literature results, the Kruskal-Wallis test and post hoc analysis with Dunn-Bonferroni test revealed several significant differences in the acoustical features not only between healthy subjects and patients but also between syndromes within the PS, FA, and MA groups. Machine learning provided a k-nearest-neighbor classifier with 86% accuracy for the PS group, a support vector machine (SVM) model with 77% accuracy for the FA group, and an SVM model with 84% accuracy for the MA group. These preliminary results suggest that the proposed method based on acoustical analysis and AI could be useful for an effective, non-invasive automatic characterization of genetic syndromes. In addition, clinicians could benefit in the case of genetic syndromes that are extremely rare or present multiple variants and facial phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Intracranial hemorrhages require an immediate diagnosis to optimize patient management and outcomes, and CT is the modality of choice in the emergency setting. We aimed to evaluate the performance of the first scanner-integrated artificial intelligence algorithm to detect brain hemorrhages in a routine clinical setting. This retrospective study includes 435 consecutive non-contrast head CT scans. Automatic brain hemorrhage detection was calculated as a separate reconstruction job in all cases. The radiological report (RR) was always conducted by a radiology resident and finalized by a senior radiologist. Additionally, a team of two radiologists reviewed the datasets retrospectively, taking additional information like the clinical record, course, and final diagnosis into account. This consensus reading served as a reference. Statistics were carried out for diagnostic accuracy. Brain hemorrhage detection was executed successfully in 432/435 (99%) of patient cases. The AI algorithm and reference standard were consistent in 392 (90.7%) cases. One false-negative case was identified within the 52 positive cases. However, 39 positive detections turned out to be false positives. The diagnostic performance was calculated as a sensitivity of 98.1%, specificity of 89.7%, positive predictive value of 56.7%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.7%. The execution of scanner-integrated AI detection of brain hemorrhages is feasible and robust. The diagnostic accuracy has a high specificity and a very high negative predictive value and sensitivity. However, many false-positive findings resulted in a relatively moderate positive predictive value.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis, marked by low bone mineral density (BMD) and a high fracture risk, is a major health issue. Recent progress in medical imaging, especially CT scans, offers new ways of diagnosing and assessing osteoporosis. This review examines the use of AI analysis of CT scans to stratify BMD and diagnose osteoporosis. By summarizing the relevant studies, we aimed to assess the effectiveness, constraints, and potential impact of AI-based osteoporosis classification (severity) via CT. A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov) was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 39 articles were retrieved from the databases, and the key findings were compiled and summarized, including the regions analyzed, the type of CT imaging, and their efficacy in predicting BMD compared with conventional DXA studies. Important considerations and limitations are also discussed. The overall reported accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of AI in classifying osteoporosis using CT images ranged from 61.8% to 99.4%, 41.0% to 100.0%, and 31.0% to 100.0% respectively, with areas under the curve (AUCs) ranging from 0.582 to 0.994. While additional research is necessary to validate the clinical efficacy and reproducibility of these AI tools before incorporating them into routine clinical practice, these studies demonstrate the promising potential of using CT to opportunistically predict and classify osteoporosis without the need for DEXA.",

    "abstract": "Several artificial intelligence (AI) systems for diabetic retinopathy screening have been validated but there is limited evidence on their performance in real-world settings. This study aimed to assess the performance of an AI software deployed within the diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Dominica.\nWe conducted a prospective, cross-sectional clinical validation study. Patients with diabetes aged 18 years and above attending the diabetic retinopathy screening in primary care facilities in Dominica from 5 June to 3 July 2021 were enrolled.Grading was done at the point of care by the field grader, followed by counselling and referral to the eye clinic. Images were then graded by an AI system. Sensitivity, specificity with 95% CIs and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated for comparing the AI to field grader as gold standard.\nA total of 587 participants were screened. The AI had a sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy of 77.5% and 91.5% compared with the grader, for all participants, including ungradable images. The AUC was 0.8455. Excluding 52 participants deemed ungradable by the grader, the AI had a sensitivity and specificity of 81.4% and 91.5%, with an AUC of 0.9648.\nThis study provides evidence that AI has the potential to be deployed to assist a diabetic screening programme in a middle-income real-world setting and perform with reasonable accuracy compared with a specialist grader.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the global workforce, presenting unprecedented challenges to managers and practitioners of strategic human resource management. Pandemic-influenced changes in the employment relationship highlighting the need for adaptation in order to facilitate a return to pre-pandemic conditions. Crises such as this can have a detrimental effect on employees' psychological contract, which in turn can hinder the organization's ability to thrive in the post-COVID-19 era and impede the development of high commitment levels in the aftermath of the crisis. Emotional intelligence plays an increasingly vital role in effectively navigating the crisis and providing support to employees, while also facilitating the reconstruction of the psychological contract. Therefore, this study aims to explain the role of emotional intelligence of strategic human resource management practitioners on affective organizational commitment and the possible mediating effect of the psychological contract in that relationship. A quantitative study took place in February 2023 among 286 HR directors, HR managers, and HR officers in higher education institutions in Georgia. Partial Least Squares for Structural Equation Modelling was applied for data analysis. The results revealed that the emotional intelligence of strategic human resource management practitioners has a positive impact on the psychological contract and the affective organizational commitment. This study supports the idea that emotional intelligence can transform strategic human resource management practitioners into individuals who engage in people-orientated activities. These activities aim to effectively acquire, utilize, and retain employees within an organization. The study also suggests that emotional intelligence can provide solutions to maintain high employee commitment during times of crisis and in the aftermath of unprecedented situations.",

    "abstract": "Airway procedures in life-threatening situations are vital for saving lives. Video laryngoscopy (VL) is commonly performed during endotracheal intubation (ETI) in the emergency department. Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in the medical field, particularly to detect anatomical structures. This study aimed to develop an AI algorithm that detects vocal cords from VL images acquired during emergent situations. This retrospective study used VL images acquired in the emergency department to facilitate the ETI. The vocal cord image was labeled with a ground-truth bounding box. The dataset was divided into training and validation datasets. The algorithm was developed from a training dataset using the YOLOv4 model. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using a test set. The test set was further divided into specific environments during the ETI for clinical subgroup analysis. In total, 20,161 images from 84 patients were used in this study. A total of 10,287, 5766, and 4108 images were used for the model training, validation, and test sets, respectively. The developed algorithm achieved F1 score 0.906, sensitivity 0.963, and specificity 0.842 in the validation set. The performance in the test set was F1 score 0.808, sensitivity 0.823, and specificity 0.804. We developed and validated an AI algorithm to detect vocal cords in VL. This algorithm demonstrated a high performance. The algorithm can be used to determine the vocal cord to ensure safe ETI.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac arrest (CA) is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients. Clinical research has shown that early identification of CA reduces mortality. Algorithms capable of predicting CA with high sensitivity have been developed using multivariate time series data. However, these algorithms suffer from a high rate of false alarms, and their results are not clinically interpretable.\nWe propose an ensemble approach using multiresolution statistical features and cosine similarity-based features for the timely prediction of CA. Furthermore, this approach provides clinically interpretable results that can be adopted by clinicians.\nPatients were retrospectively analyzed using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database and the eICU Collaborative Research Database. Based on the multivariate vital signs of a 24-hour time window for adults diagnosed with heart failure, we extracted multiresolution statistical and cosine similarity-based features. These features were used to construct and develop gradient boosting decision trees. Therefore, we adopted cost-sensitive learning as a solution. Then, 10-fold cross-validation was performed to check the consistency of the model performance, and the Shapley additive explanation algorithm was used to capture the overall interpretability of the proposed model. Next, external validation using the eICU Collaborative Research Database was performed to check the generalization ability.\nThe proposed method yielded an overall area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.86 and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.58. In terms of the timely prediction of CA, the proposed model achieved an AUROC above 0.80 for predicting CA events up to 6 hours in advance. The proposed method simultaneously improved precision and sensitivity to increase the AUPRC, which reduced the number of false alarms while maintaining high sensitivity. This result indicates that the predictive performance of the proposed model is superior to the performances of the models reported in previous studies. Next, we demonstrated the effect of feature importance on the clinical interpretability of the proposed method and inferred the effect between the non-CA and CA groups. Finally, external validation was performed using the eICU Collaborative Research Database, and an AUROC of 0.74 and AUPRC of 0.44 were obtained in a general intensive care unit population.\nThe proposed framework can provide clinicians with more accurate CA prediction results and reduce false alarm rates through internal and external validation. In addition, clinically interpretable prediction results can facilitate clinician understanding. Furthermore, the similarity of vital sign changes can provide insights into temporal pattern changes in CA prediction in patients with heart failure-related diagnoses. Therefore, our system is sufficiently feasible for routine clinical use. In addition, regarding the proposed CA prediction system, a clinically mature application has been developed and verified in the future digital health field.",

    "results": "The proposed method yielded an overall area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.86 and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.58. In terms of the timely prediction of CA, the proposed model achieved an AUROC above 0.80 for predicting CA events up to 6 hours in advance. The proposed method simultaneously improved precision and sensitivity to increase the AUPRC, which reduced the number of false alarms while maintaining high sensitivity. This result indicates that the predictive performance of the proposed model is superior to the performances of the models reported in previous studies. Next, we demonstrated the effect of feature importance on the clinical interpretability of the proposed method and inferred the effect between the non-CA and CA groups. Finally, external validation was performed using the eICU Collaborative Research Database, and an AUROC of 0.74 and AUPRC of 0.44 were obtained in a general intensive care unit population.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the way medicine is learned, taught, and practiced, and medical education must prepare learners for these inevitable changes. Academic medicine has, however, been slow to embrace recent AI advances. Since its launch in November 2022, ChatGPT has emerged as a fast and user-friendly large language model that can assist health care professionals, medical educators, students, trainees, and patients. While many studies focus on the technology's capabilities, potential, and risks, there is a gap in studying the perspective of end users.\nThe aim of this study was to gauge the experiences and perspectives of graduating medical students on ChatGPT and AI in their training and future careers.\nA cross-sectional web-based survey of recently graduated medical students was conducted in an international academic medical center between May 5, 2023, and June 13, 2023. Descriptive statistics were used to tabulate variable frequencies.\nOf 325 applicants to the residency programs, 265 completed the survey (an 81.5% response rate). The vast majority of respondents denied using ChatGPT in medical school, with 20.4% (n=54) using it to help complete written assessments and only 9.4% using the technology in their clinical work (n=25). More students planned to use it during residency, primarily for exploring new medical topics and research (n=168, 63.4%) and exam preparation (n=151, 57%). Male students were significantly more likely to believe that AI will improve diagnostic accuracy (n=47, 51.7% vs n=69, 39.7%; P=.001), reduce medical error (n=53, 58.2% vs n=71, 40.8%; P=.002), and improve patient care (n=60, 65.9% vs n=95, 54.6%; P=.007). Previous experience with AI was significantly associated with positive AI perception in terms of improving patient care, decreasing medical errors and misdiagnoses, and increasing the accuracy of diagnoses (P=.001, P<.001, P=.008, respectively).\nThe surveyed medical students had minimal formal and informal experience with AI tools and limited perceptions of the potential uses of AI in health care but had overall positive views of ChatGPT and AI and were optimistic about the future of AI in medical education and health care. Structured curricula and formal policies and guidelines are needed to adequately prepare medical learners for the forthcoming integration of AI in medicine.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic spread is characterized by considerable heterogeneity in most cancers. With increasing treatment options for patients with metastatic disease, there is a need for insight into metastatic patterns of spread in breast cancer patients using large-scale studies.\nRecords of 2622 metastatic breast cancer patients who underwent autopsy (1974-2010) were retrieved from the nationwide Dutch pathology databank (PALGA). Natural language processing (NLP) and manual information extraction (IE) were applied to identify the tumors, patient characteristics, and locations of metastases.\nThe accuracy (0.90) and recall (0.94) of the NLP model outperformed manual IE (on 132 randomly selected patients). Adenocarcinoma no special type more frequently metastasizes to the lung (55.7%) and liver (51.8%), whereas, invasive lobular carcinoma mostly spread to the bone (54.4%) and liver (43.8%), respectively. Patients with tumor grade III had a higher chance of developing bone metastases (61.6%). In a subgroup of patients, we found that ER+/HER2+ patients were more likely to metastasize to the liver and bone, compared to ER-/HER2+ patients.\nThis is the first large-scale study that demonstrates that artificial intelligence methods are efficient for IE from Dutch databanks. Different histological subtypes show different frequencies and combinations of metastatic sites which may reflect the underlying biology of metastatic breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Artificial-intelligence-based methods are regularly used in the biomedical sciences, mainly in the field of diagnostic imaging. Recently, convolutional neural networks have been trained to score pleurisy and pneumonia in slaughtered pigs. The aim of this study is to further evaluate the performance of a convolutional neural network when compared with the gold standard (i.e., scores provided by a skilled operator along the slaughter chain through visual inspection and palpation). In total, 441 lungs (180 healthy and 261 diseased) are included in this study. Each lung was scored according to traditional methods, which represent the gold standard (Madec's and Christensen's grids). Moreover, the same lungs were photographed and thereafter scored by a trained convolutional neural network. Overall, the results reveal that the convolutional neural network is very specific (95.55%) and quite sensitive (85.05%), showing a rather high correlation when compared with the scores provided by a skilled veterinarian (Spearman's coefficient = 0.831, ",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of individual breast cancer risk paves the way for personalised prevention and early detection. The incorporation of genetic information and breast density has been shown to improve predictions for existing models, but detailed image-based features are yet to be included despite correlating with risk. Complex information can be extracted from mammograms using deep-learning algorithms, however, this is a challenging area of research, partly due to the lack of data within the field, and partly due to the computational burden. We propose an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) model that can make accurate, short-term risk predictions from mammograms taken prior to the detection of cancer at full resolution. Current screen-detected cancers are mixed in with priors during model development to promote the detection of features associated with risk specifically and features associated with cancer formation, in addition to alleviating data scarcity issues. MAI-risk achieves an AUC of 0.747 [0.711, 0.783] in cancer-free screening mammograms of women who went on to develop a screen-detected or interval cancer between 5 and 55 months, outperforming both IBIS (AUC 0.594 [0.557, 0.633]) and VAS (AUC 0.649 [0.614, 0.683]) alone when accounting for established clinical risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a common ocular microvascular complication of diabetes, contributes significantly to diabetes-related vision loss. This study addresses the imperative need for early diagnosis of DR and precise treatment strategies based on the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework. The study integrated clinical, biochemical, and metabolomic biomarkers associated with the following classes: non-DR (NDR), non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. To create machine learning (ML) models, 10% of the data was divided into validation sets and 90% into discovery sets. The validation dataset was used for hyperparameter optimization and feature selection stages, while the discovery dataset was used to measure the performance of the models. A 10-fold cross-validation technique was used to evaluate the performance of ML models. Biomarker discovery was performed using minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), Boruta, and explainable boosting machine (EBM). The predictive proposed framework compares the results of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), natural gradient boosting for probabilistic prediction (NGBoost), and EBM models in determining the DR subclass. The hyperparameters of the models were optimized using Bayesian optimization. Combining EBM feature selection with XGBoost, the optimal model achieved (91.25 \u00b1 1.88) % accuracy, (89.33 \u00b1 1.80) % precision, (91.24 \u00b1 1.67) % recall, (89.37 \u00b1 1.52) % F1-Score, and (97.00 \u00b1 0.25) % the area under the ROC curve (AUROC). According to the EBM explanation, the six most important biomarkers in determining the course of DR were tryptophan (Trp), phosphatidylcholine diacyl C42:2 (PC.aa.C42.2), butyrylcarnitine (C4), tyrosine (Tyr), hexadecanoyl carnitine (C16) and total dimethylarginine (DMA). The identified biomarkers may provide a better understanding of the progression of DR, paving the way for more precise and cost-effective diagnostic and treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy (RS) techniques are attracting attention in the medical field as a promising tool for real-time biochemical analyses. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms with RS has greatly enhanced its ability to accurately classify spectral data in vivo. This combination has opened up new possibilities for precise and efficient analysis in medical applications. In this study, healthy and cancerous specimens from 22 patients who underwent open colorectal surgery were collected. By using these spectral data, we investigate an optimal preprocessing pipeline for statistical analysis using AI techniques. This exploration entails proposing preprocessing methods and algorithms to enhance classification outcomes. The research encompasses a thorough ablation study comparing machine learning and deep learning algorithms toward the advancement of the clinical applicability of RS. The results indicate substantial accuracy improvements using techniques like baseline correction, L2 normalization, filtering, and PCA, yielding an overall accuracy enhancement of 15.8%. In comparing various algorithms, machine learning models, such as XGBoost and Random Forest, demonstrate effectiveness in classifying both normal and abnormal tissues. Similarly, deep learning models, such as 1D-Resnet and particularly the 1D-CNN model, exhibit superior performance in classifying abnormal cases. This research contributes valuable insights into the integration of AI in medical diagnostics and expands the potential of RS methods for achieving accurate malignancy classification.",

    "abstract": "Our image recognition system employs a deep learning model to differentiate between the left and right upper limbs in images, allowing doctors to determine the correct surgical position. From the experimental results, it was found that the precision rate and the recall rate of the intelligent image recognition system for preventing wrong-site upper limb surgery proposed in this paper could reach 98% and 93%, respectively. The results proved that our Artificial Intelligence Image Recognition System (AIIRS) could indeed assist orthopedic surgeons in preventing the occurrence of wrong-site left and right upper limb surgery. At the same time, in future, we will apply for an IRB based on our prototype experimental results and we will conduct the second phase of human trials. The results of this research paper are of great benefit and research value to upper limb orthopedic surgery.",

    "abstract": "The surge in the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has permeated many aspects of our life, and health care is no exception. Whereas this technology can offer clear benefits, some of the problems associated with its use have also been recognised and brought into question, for example, its environmental impact. In a similar fashion, health care also has a significant environmental impact, and it requires a considerable source of greenhouse gases. Whereas efforts are being made to reduce the footprint of AI tools, here, we were specifically interested in how employing AI tools in gastroenterology departments, and in particular in conjunction with capsule endoscopy, can reduce the carbon footprint associated with digestive health care while offering improvements, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy. We address the different ways that leveraging AI applications can reduce the carbon footprint associated with all types of capsule endoscopy examinations. Moreover, we contemplate how the incorporation of other technologies, such as blockchain technology, into digestive health care can help ensure the sustainability of this clinical speciality and by extension, health care in general.",

    "abstract": "Preterm birth is a live birth that occurs before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. Approximately 11% of babies are born preterm annually worldwide. Blood pressure (BP) monitoring is essential for managing the haemodynamic stability of preterm infants and impacts outcomes. However, current methods have many limitations associated, including invasive measurement, inaccuracies, and infection risk. In this narrative review, we find that artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising tool for the continuous measurement of BP in a neonatal cohort, based on data obtained from non-invasive sensors. Our findings highlight key sensing technologies, AI techniques, and model assessment metrics for BP sensing in the neonatal cohort. Moreover, our findings show that non-invasive BP monitoring leveraging AI has shown promise in adult cohorts but has not been broadly explored for neonatal cohorts. We conclude that there is a significant research opportunity in developing an innovative approach to provide a non-invasive alternative to existing continuous BP monitoring methods, which has the potential to improve outcomes for premature babies.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence-based myopic maculopathy grading method using EfficientNet to overcome the delayed grading and diagnosis of different myopic maculopathy degrees.\nThe cooperative hospital provided 4642 healthy and myopic maculopathy color fundus photographs, comprising the four degrees of myopic maculopathy and healthy fundi. The myopic maculopathy grading models were trained using EfficientNet-B0 to EfficientNet-B7 models. The diagnostic results were compared with those of the VGG16 and ResNet50 classification models. The leading evaluation indicators were sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under curve (AUC), 95% confidence interval, kappa value, and accuracy. The ROC curves of the ten grading models were also compared.\nWe used 1199 color fundus photographs to evaluate the myopic maculopathy grading models. The size of the EfficientNet-B0 myopic maculopathy grading model was 15.6 MB, and it had the highest kappa value (88.32%) and accuracy (83.58%). The model's sensitivities to diagnose tessellated fundus (TF), diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (DCA), patchy chorioretinal atrophy (PCA), and macular atrophy (MA) were 96.86%, 75.98%, 64.67%, and 88.75%, respectively. The specificity was above 93%, and the AUCs were 0.992, 0.960, 0.964, and 0.989, respectively.\nThe EfficientNet models were used to design grading diagnostic models for myopic maculopathy. Based on the collected fundus images, the models could diagnose a healthy fundus and four types of myopic maculopathy. The models might help ophthalmologists to make preliminary diagnoses of different degrees of myopic maculopathy.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is often trained on images without ocular co-morbidities, limiting its generalizability. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of a convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to color fundus photos (CFPs) with simulated cataracts (SCs) in detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR).\nA database of 3662 CFPs (from Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) 2019) was used. Using transfer learning, a CNN was trained to classify the training images as either DR or non-DR. The CNN was then applied to classify the testing images after an SC was applied, using varying degrees of Gaussian blur.\nAccuracy without SC was 97.0%, sensitivity (Sn) 95.7%, specificity (Sp) 98.3%. For mild SC, accuracy was 93.1%, Sn 91.8%, Sp 94.3%. For moderate SC, accuracy was 62.8%, Sn 31.4%, Sp 95.2%. For severe SC, accuracy was 53.5%, Sn 11.8%, Sp 96.5%.\nSCs significantly impaired AI accuracy. To prepare AI for clinical use, cataracts and other real-world clinical challenges affecting image quality must be accounted for.",

    "abstract": "Endoscopic screening for gastric cancer (GC) is not recommended in low-intermediate incidence countries. Artificial intelligence (AI) has high accuracy in GC detection and might increase the cost-effectiveness of screening strategies. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of AI for GC detection in settings with different GC incidence and different accuracies of AI systems.\nCost-effectiveness analysis (using Markov model) comparing different screening strategies (no screening versus single esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at 50 years versus stand-alone EGD every 5/10 years versus combined EGD and screening colonoscopy once or twice per decade in Netherlands, Italy and Portugal) with variable AI accuracy settings. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the different strategies versus no screening. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.\nWithout AI, one single EGD at 50 years (Netherlands, Italy, Portugal), EGD combined with screening colonoscopy once per decade (Italy and Portugal) and EGD combined with screening colonoscopy twice per decade (Portugal) are cost-effective when compared with no screening. If AI increases the accuracy of EGD by at least 1% in comparison to the accuracy of white-light endoscopy accuracy (89%), combined screening twice per decade also becomes cost-effective in Italy. If AI accuracy reaches at least 96%, combined screening once per decade is also cost-effective in the Netherlands.\nIn European countries, AI-assisted EGD may improve the cost-effectiveness of GC screening with combined EGD and screening colonoscopy. The actual effect of AI on cost-effectiveness may vary dependent on the accuracy and costs of the AI system.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has impacted many areas of healthcare. AI in healthcare uses machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing to analyze copious amounts of healthcare data and yield valuable outcomes. In the sleep medicine field, a large amount of physiological data is gathered compared to other branches of medicine. This field is primed for innovations with the help of AI. A good quality of sleep is crucial for optimal health. About one billion people are estimated to have obstructive sleep apnea worldwide, but it is difficult to diagnose and treat all the people with limited resources. Sleep apnea is one of the major contributors to poor health. Most of the sleep apnea patients remain undiagnosed. Those diagnosed with sleep apnea have difficulty getting it optimally treated due to several factors, and AI can help in this situation. AI can also help in the diagnosis and management of other sleep disorders such as insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia, narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorders, periodic leg movement disorders, ",

    "abstract": "This systematic review summarizes existing evidence and outlines the benefits of artificial intelligence-assisted spine surgery. The popularity of artificial intelligence has grown significantly, demonstrating its benefits in computer-assisted surgery and advancements in spinal treatment. This study adhered to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), a set of reporting guidelines specifically designed for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The search strategy used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, including \"MeSH (Artificial intelligence),\" \"Spine\" AND \"Spinal\" filters, in the last 10 years, and English- from January 1, 2013, to October 31, 2023. In total, 442 articles fulfilled the first screening criteria. A detailed analysis of those articles identified 220 that matched the criteria, of which 11 were considered appropriate for this analysis after applying the complete inclusion and exclusion criteria. In total, 11 studies met the eligibility criteria. Analysis of these studies revealed the types of artificial intelligence-assisted spine surgery. No evidence suggests the superiority of assisted spine surgery with or without artificial intelligence in terms of outcomes. In terms of feasibility, accuracy, safety, and facilitating lower patient radiation exposure compared with standard fluoroscopic guidance, artificial intelligence-assisted spine surgery produced satisfactory and superior outcomes. The incorporation of artificial intelligence with augmented and virtual reality appears promising, with the potential to enhance surgeon proficiency and overall surgical safety.",

    "abstract": "Virtual screening (VS) is an integral and ever-evolving domain of drug discovery framework. The VS is traditionally classified into ligand-based (LB) and structure-based (SB) approaches. Machine intelligence or artificial intelligence has wide applications in the drug discovery domain to reduce time and resource consumption. In combination with machine intelligence algorithms, VS has emerged into revolutionarily progressive technology that learns within robust decision orders for data curation and hit molecule screening from large VS libraries in minutes or hours. The exponential growth of chemical and biological data has evolved as \"big-data\" in the public domain demands modern and advanced machine intelligence-driven VS approaches to screen hit molecules from ultra-large VS libraries. VS has evolved from an individual approach (LB and SB) to integrated LB and SB techniques to explore various ligand and target protein aspects for the enhanced rate of appropriate hit molecule prediction. Current trends demand advanced and intelligent solutions to handle enormous data in drug discovery domain for screening and optimizing hits or lead with fewer or no false positive hits. Following the big-data drift and tremendous growth in computational architecture, we presented this review. Here, the article categorized and emphasized individual VS techniques, detailed literature presented for machine learning implementation, modern machine intelligence approaches, and limitations and deliberated the future prospects.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of artificial intelligence (AI) to medical imaging is currently the object of widespread experimentation. The development of deep learning (DL) methods, particularly convolution neural networks (CNNs), has led to performance gains often superior to those achieved by conventional methods such as machine learning. Radiomics is an approach aimed at extracting quantitative data not accessible to the human eye from images expressing a disease. The data subsequently feed machine learning models and produce diagnostic or prognostic probabilities. As for the multiple applications of AI methods in thoracic imaging, they are undergoing evaluation. Chest radiography is a practically ideal field for the development of DL algorithms able to automatically interpret X-rays. Current algorithms can detect up to 14 different abnormalities present either in isolation or in combination. Chest CT is another area offering numerous AI applications. Various algorithms have been specifically formed and validated for the detection and characterization of pulmonary nodules and pulmonary embolism, as well as segmentation and quantitative analysis of the extent of diffuse lung diseases (emphysema, infectious pneumonias, interstitial lung disease). In addition, the analysis of medical images can be associated with clinical, biological, and functional data (multi-omics analysis), the objective being to construct predictive approaches regarding disease prognosis and response to treatment.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) expands its presence in healthcare, particularly within emergency medicine (EM), there is growing urgency to explore the ethical and practical considerations surrounding its adoption. AI holds the potential to revolutionize how emergency physicians (EPs) make clinical decisions, but AI's complexity often surpasses EPs' capacity to provide patients with informed consent regarding its use. This article underscores the crucial need to address the ethical pitfalls of AI in EM. Patient autonomy necessitates that EPs engage in conversations with patients about whether to use AI in their evaluation and treatment. As clinical AI integration expands, this discussion should become an integral part of the informed consent process, aligning with ethical and legal requirements. The rapid availability of AI programs, fueled by vast electronic health record (EHR) datasets, has led to increased pressure on hospitals and clinicians to embrace clinical AI without comprehensive system evaluation. However, the evolving landscape of AI technology outpaces our ability to anticipate its impact on medical practice and patient care. The central question arises: Are EPs equipped with the necessary knowledge to offer well-informed consent regarding clinical AI? Collaborative efforts between EPs, bioethicists, AI researchers, and healthcare administrators are essential for the development and implementation of optimal AI practices in EM. To facilitate informed consent about AI, EPs should understand at least seven key areas: (1) how AI systems operate; (2) whether AI systems are understandable and trustworthy; (3) the limitations of and errors AI systems make; (4) how disagreements between the EP and AI are resolved; (5) whether the patient's personally identifiable information (PII) and the AI computer systems will be secure; (6) if the AI system functions reliably (has been validated); and (7) if the AI program exhibits bias. This article addresses each of these critical issues, aiming to empower EPs with the knowledge required to navigate the intersection of AI and informed consent in EM.",

    "abstract": "Natural language processing chatbots (NLPC) can be used to gather information for medical content. However, these tools contain a potential risk of misinformation. This study aims to evaluate different aspects of responses given by different NLPCs on questions about atrial fibrillation (AF) and clinical implantable electronic devices (CIED).\nQuestions were entered into three different NLPC interfaces. Responses were evaluated with regard to appropriateness, comprehensibility, appearance of confabulation, absence of relevant content, and recommendations given for clinically relevant decisions. Moreover, readability was assessed by calculating word count and Flesch Reading Ease score. 52, 60, and 84% of responses on AF and 16, 72, and 88% on CIEDs were evaluated to be appropriate for all responses given by Google Bard, (GB) Bing Chat (BC) and ChatGPT Plus (CGP), respectively. Assessment of comprehensibility showed that 96, 88, and 92% of responses on AF and 92 and 88%, and 100% on CIEDs were comprehensible for all responses created by GB, BC, and CGP, respectively. Readability varied between different NLPCs. Relevant aspects were missing in 52% (GB), 60% (BC), and 24% (CGP) for AF, and in 92% (GB), 88% (BC), and 52% (CGP) for CIEDs.\nResponses generated by an NLPC are mostly easy to understand with varying readability between the different NLPCs. The appropriateness of responses is limited and varies between different NLPCs. Important aspects are often missed to be mentioned. Thus, chatbots should be used with caution to gather medical information about cardiac arrhythmias and devices.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the potential use of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, such as ChatGPT, in preoperative counseling for patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery.\nCross-Sectional Survey Study.\nSingle institution tertiary care center.\nChatGPT was used to generate presurgical educational information including indications, risks, and recovery time for five common head and neck surgeries. Chatbot-generated information was compared with information gathered from a simple browser search (first publicly available website excluding scholarly articles). The accuracy of the information, readability, thoroughness, and number of errors were compared by five experienced head and neck surgeons in a blinded fashion. Each surgeon then chose a preference between the two information sources for each surgery.\nWith the exception of total word count, ChatGPT-generated pre-surgical information has similar readability, content of knowledge, accuracy, thoroughness, and numbers of medical errors when compared to publicly available websites. Additionally, ChatGPT was preferred 48% of the time by experienced head and neck surgeons.\nHead and neck surgeons rated ChatGPT-generated and readily available online educational materials similarly. Further refinement in AI technology may soon open more avenues for patient counseling.

However, its potential beyond the diagnostic phase remains to be determined. The current review focuses on the insights that coronary CT angiography can provide when planning and performing percutaneous coronary interventions. We describe a novel approach incorporating anatomical and functional pre-procedural planning enhanced by artificial intelligence, computational physiology and online 3D CT guidance for percutaneous coronary interventions. This strategy allows the individualisation of patient selection, optimisation of the revascularisation strategy and effective use of resources.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, organizational and management research has been reporting the presence of a systematic link between emotional intelligence (EI) and leadership effectiveness. Notwithstanding the practical significance, however, scholarly attention is far from adequate especially in the context of African higher education. Thus, taking Ethiopia as an example, this study investigates (a) gender differences in EI and (b) the relationship between EI and leadership style among leaders in selected higher education institutions. The study was conducted on 210 random samples of academic leaders (135 men and 75 women). Data was generated using an adapted measure Emotional and Social Competence Inventory (ESCI) to assess leaders' emotional intelligence (EI), while the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ-5x) was used to measure leadership styles. The findings show a strong positive relationship between emotional intelligence and transformational leadership, but no relationship was found between EI and transactional leadership. On the other hand, a significant negative correlation was found between laissez-faire leadership and leaders' total EI scores. Furthermore, the study finds significant gender differences in emotional intelligence, with female leaders scoring higher in overall emotional intelligence and most of the EI components. These findings suggest that EI is the female leadership advantage. We strongly advise university administrators and policymakers to incorporate EI as a criterion for the recruitment, selection, and promotion of academic leaders to close the gender gap in higher education leadership.",

    "abstract": "Visual object detection has emerged as a critical technology for Unmanned Arial Vehicle (UAV) use due to advances in computer vision. New developments in fields like communication technology and the UAV needs to be able to act autonomously by gathering data and then making choices. These tendencies have brought us to cutting-edge levels of health care, transportation, energy, monitoring, and security for visual image detection and manufacturing endeavors. These include coordination in communication via IoT, sustainability of IoT network, and optimization challenges in path planning. Because of their limited battery life, these gadgets are limited in their range of communication. UAVs can be seen as terminal devices connected to a large network where a swarm of other UAVs is coordinating their motions, directing one another, and maintaining watch over locations outside its visual range. One of the essential components of UAV-based applications is the ability to recognize objects of interest in aerial photographs taken by UAVs. While aerial photos might be useful, object detection is challenging. As a result, capturing aerial photographs with UAVs is a unique challenge since the size of things in these images might vary greatly. The study proposal included specific information regarding the Detection of Visual Images by UAVs (DVI-UAV) using the IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Included in the study of AI is the concept of DSYolov3. The DSYolov3 model was presented to deal with these problems in the UAV industry. By fusing the channel-wise feature across multiple scales using a spatial pyramid pooling approach, the proposed study creates a novel module, Multi-scale Fusion of Channel Attention (MFCAM), for scale-variant object identification tasks. The method's effectiveness and efficiency have been thoroughly tested and evaluated experimentally. The suggested method would allow us to outperform most current detectors and guarantee that the models will be useable on UAVs. There will be a 95\u00a0% success rate in terms of visual image detection, a 94\u00a0% success rate in terms of computation cost, a 97\u00a0% success rate in terms of accuracy, and a 95\u00a0% success rate in terms of effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been the subject of studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and may affect its identification, diagnosis, intervention, and other medical practices in the future. Although previous studies have used bibliometric techniques to analyze and investigate AI, there has been little research on the adoption of AI in ASD. This study aimed to explore the broad applications and research frontiers of AI used in ASD.\nCitation data were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database to assess the extent to which AI is used in ASD. CiteSpace.5.8. R3 and VOSviewer, two online tools for literature metrology analysis, were used to analyze the data.\nA total of 776 publications from 291 countries and regions were analyzed; of these, 256 publications were from the United States and 173 publications were from China, and England had the largest centrality of 0.33; Stanford University had the highest H-index of 17; and the largest cluster label of co-cited references was machine learning. In addition, keywords with a high number of occurrences in this field were autism spectrum disorder (295), children (255), classification (156) and diagnosis (77). The burst keywords from 2021 to 2023 were infants and feature selection, and from 2022 to 2023, the burst keyword was corpus callosum.\nThis research provides a systematic analysis of the literature concerning AI used in ASD, presenting an overall demonstration in this field. In this area, the United States and China have the largest number of publications, England has the greatest influence, and Stanford University is the most influential. In addition, the research on AI used in ASD mostly focuses on classification and diagnosis, and \"infants, feature selection, and corpus callosum are at the forefront, providing directions for future research. However, the use of AI technologies to identify ASD will require further research.",

    "abstract": "This comprehensive exploration unveils the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within medicine and surgery. Through a meticulous journey, we examine AI's current applications in healthcare, including medical diagnostics, surgical procedures, and advanced therapeutics. Delving into the theoretical foundations of AI, encompassing machine learning, deep learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), we illuminate the critical underpinnings supporting AI's integration into healthcare. Highlighting the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, we emphasize how AI augments clinical capabilities without supplanting the irreplaceable human touch in healthcare delivery. Also, we'd like to briefly mention critical findings and takeaways they can expect to encounter in the article. A thoughtful analysis of the economic, societal, and ethical implications of AI's integration into healthcare underscores our commitment to addressing critical issues, such as data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and equitable access to AI-driven healthcare services. As we contemplate the future landscape, we project an exciting vista where more sophisticated AI algorithms and real-time surgical visualizations redefine the boundaries of medical achievement. While acknowledging the limitations of the present research, we shed light on AI's pivotal role in enhancing patient engagement, education, and data security within the burgeoning realm of AI-driven healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Odor is central to food quality. Still, a major challenge is to understand how the odorants present in a given food contribute to its specific odor profile, and how to predict this olfactory outcome from the chemical composition. In this proof-of-concept study, we seek to develop an integrative model that combines expert knowledge, fuzzy logic, and machine learning to predict the quantitative odor description of complex mixtures of odorants. The model output is the intensity of relevant odor sensory attributes calculated on the basis of the content in odor-active comounds. The core of the model is the mathematically formalized knowledge of four senior flavorists, which provided a set of optimized rules describing the sensory-relevant combinations of odor qualities the experts have in mind to elaborate the target odor sensory attributes. The model first queries analytical and sensory databases in order to standardize, homogenize, and quantitatively code the odor descriptors of the odorants. Then the standardized odor descriptors are translated into a limited number of odor qualities used by the experts thanks to an ontology. A third step consists of aggregating all the information in terms of odor qualities across all the odorants found in a given product. The final step is a set of knowledge-based fuzzy membership functions representing the flavorist expertise and ensuring the prediction of the intensity of the target odor sensory descriptors on the basis of the products' aggregated odor qualities; several methods of optimization of the fuzzy membership functions have been tested. Finally, the model was applied to predict the odor profile of 16 red wines from two grape varieties for which the content in odorants was available. The results showed that the model can predict the perceptual outcome of food odor with a certain level of accuracy, and may also provide insights into combinations of odorants not mentioned by the experts.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are becoming increasingly popular. In this bibliometric study, we aimed to analyze the characteristics of publications relevant to the research of AI in RA, thereby developing a thorough overview of this research topic. Web of Science was used to retrieve publications on the application of AI in RA from 2003 to 2022. Bibliometric analysis and visualization were performed using Microsoft Excel (2019), R software (4.2.2) and VOSviewer (1.6.18). The overall distribution of yearly outputs, leading countries, top institutions and authors, active journals, co-cited references and keywords were analyzed. A total of 859 relevant articles were identified in the Web of Science with an increasing trend. USA and China were the leading countries in this field, accounting for 71.59% of publications in total. Harvard University was the most influential institution. Arthritis Research & Therapy was the most active journal. Primary topics in this field focused on estimating the risk of developing RA, diagnosing RA using sensor, clinical, imaging and omics data, identifying the phenotype of RA patients using electronic health records, predicting treatment response, tracking the progression of the disease and predicting prognosis and developing new drugs. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms were the recent research hotspots and trends in this field. AI has potential applications in various fields of RA, including the risk assessment, screening, early diagnosis, monitoring, prognosis determination, achieving optimal therapeutic outcomes and new drug development for RA patients. Incorporating machine learning and deep learning algorithms into real-world clinical practice will be a future research hotspot and trend for AI in RA. Extensive collaboration to improve model maturity and robustness will be a critical step in the advancement of AI in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "We tested the ability of chat generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT), an artificial intelligence chatbot, to answer questions relevant to scenarios covered in 3 clinical guidelines, published by the Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care (SNACC), which has published management guidelines: endovascular treatment of stroke, perioperative stroke (Stroke), and care of patients undergoing complex spine surgery (Spine).\nFour neuroanesthesiologists independently assessed whether ChatGPT could apply 52 high-quality recommendations (HQRs) included in the 3 SNACC guidelines. HQRs were deemed present in the ChatGPT responses if noted by at least 3 of the 4 reviewers. Reviewers also identified incorrect references, potentially harmful recommendations, and whether ChatGPT cited the SNACC guidelines.\nThe overall reviewer agreement for the presence of HQRs in the ChatGPT answers ranged from 0% to 100%. Only 4 of 52 (8%) HQRs were deemed present by at least 3 of the 4 reviewers after 5 generic questions, and 23 (44%) HQRs were deemed present after at least 1 additional targeted question. Potentially harmful recommendations were identified for each of the 3 clinical scenarios and ChatGPT failed to cite the SNACC guidelines.\nThe ChatGPT answers were open to human interpretation regarding whether the responses included the HQRs. Though targeted questions resulted in the inclusion of more HQRs than generic questions, fewer than 50% of HQRs were noted even after targeted questions. This suggests that ChatGPT should not currently be considered a reliable source of information for clinical decision-making. Future iterations of ChatGPT may refine algorithms to improve its reliability as a source of clinical information.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare describes algorithm-based computational techniques which manage and analyse large datasets to make inferences and predictions. There are many potential applications of AI in the care of older people, from clinical decision support systems that can support identification of delirium from clinical records to wearable devices that can predict the risk of a fall. We held four meetings of older people, clinicians and AI researchers. Three priority areas were identified for AI application in the care of older people. These included: monitoring and early diagnosis of disease, stratified care and care coordination between healthcare providers. However, the meetings also highlighted concerns that AI may exacerbate health inequity for older people through bias within AI models, lack of external validation amongst older people, infringements on privacy and autonomy, insufficient transparency of AI models and lack of safeguarding for errors. Creating effective interventions for older people requires a person-centred approach to account for the needs of older people, as well as sufficient clinical and technological governance to meet standards of generalisability, transparency and effectiveness. Education of clinicians and patients is also needed to ensure appropriate use of AI technologies, with investment in technological infrastructure required to ensure equity of access.",

    "abstract": "BoneXpert (BX) is an artificial intelligence software used primarily for bone age assessment. Besides, it can also be used to screen for bone health using the digital radiogrammetry tool called bone health index (BHI) for which normative reference values available are calculated from healthy European children. Due to ethnic difference in bone geometry, in a previous study, we generated reference curves based on healthy Indian children. The objectives of this study were: 1) To assess and compare bone health of Indian children with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) using both European and Indian BHI SDS reference data and 2) To identify determinants of poor bone health in Indian children and youth with T1D by using BHI tool (based on BHI-SDS Indian reference data) of BX.\nThe BHI was assessed retrospectively in 1159 subjects with T1D using digitalised left-hand x-rays and SDS were computed using European and Indian data. The demographic, anthropometric, clinical, biochemistry, dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) data collection were performed using standard protocols and were extracted from hospital records.\nThe BHI correlated well with DXA and pQCT parameters in subjects with T1D. BHI-SDS calculated using Indian reference data had better correlation with height and DXA parameters. 8.6% study participants had low (less than -2) BHI-SDS (Indian), with height SDS having significant effect. Subjects with low BHI-SDS were older, shorter and had higher duration of diabetes. They also had lower IGF1 and vitamin D concentrations, bone mineral density, and trabecular density. Female gender, increased duration of illness, poor glycaemic control, and vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency were significant predictors of poor BHI-SDS.\nOur study highlights the utility of digital radiogrammetry AI tool to screen for bone health of children with T1D and demonstrates and highlights the necessity of interpretation using ethnicity specific normative data.",

    "results": "The BHI correlated well with DXA and pQCT parameters in subjects with T1D. BHI-SDS calculated using Indian reference data had better correlation with height and DXA parameters. 8.6% study participants had low (less than -2) BHI-SDS (Indian), with height SDS having significant effect. Subjects with low BHI-SDS were older, shorter and had higher duration of diabetes. They also had lower IGF1 and vitamin D concentrations, bone mineral density, and trabecular density. Female gender, increased duration of illness, poor glycaemic control, and vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency were significant predictors of poor BHI-SDS.",

    "abstract": "Current efforts to adapt to climate change are not sufficient to reduce projected impacts. Vulnerability assessments are essential to allocate resources where they are needed most. However, current assessments that use principal component analysis suffer from multiple shortcomings and are hard to translate into concrete actions. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel data-driven vulnerability assessment within a risk framework. The framework is based on the definitions from the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but some definitions, such as sensitivity and adaptive capacity, are clarified. Heat waves that occurred between 2001 and 2018 in Quebec (Canada) are used to validate the framework. The studied impact is the daily mortality rates per cooling degree-days (CDD) region. A vulnerability map is produced to identify the distributions of summer mortality rates in aggregate dissemination areas within each CDD region. Socioeconomic and environmental variables are used to calculate impact and vulnerability. We compared abilities of AutoGluon (an AutoML framework), Gaussian process, and deep Gaussian process to model the impact and vulnerability. We offer advice on how to avoid common pitfalls with artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms. Gaussian process is a promising approach for supporting the proposed framework. SHAP values provide an explanation for the model results and are consistent with current knowledge of vulnerability. Recommendations are made to implement the proposed framework quantitatively or qualitatively.",

    "abstract": "Panax notoginseng powder (PNP) has high medicinal value and is widely used in the medical and health food industries. However, the adulteration of PNP in the market has dramatically reduced its efficacy. Therefore, this study intends to use artificial intelligence sensory (AIS) and multi-source information fusion (MIF) technology to try to establish a quality evaluation system for different grades of PNP and adulterated Panax notoginseng powder (AD-PNP). The highest accuracy rate reached 100% in identifying PNP grade and adulteration. In the prediction of adulteration ratio and total saponin content, the optimal determination coefficients of the test set were 0.9965 and 0.9948, respectively, and the root mean square errors were 0.0109 and 0.0123, respectively. Therefore, the grade identification method of PNP and the evaluation system of AD-PNP based on AIS and MIF technology can rapidly and accurately evaluate the quality of PNP.",
