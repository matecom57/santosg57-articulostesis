    "abstract": "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML; a subset of AI) have become increasingly important to the biomedical research community. These technologies, coupled to big data and cheminformatics, have tremendous potential to improve the design of novel therapeutics and to provide safe and effective drugs to patients. A National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) program called A Specialized Platform for Innovative Research Exploration (ASPIRE) leverages advances in AI/ML, automated synthetic chemistry, and high-throughput biology, and seeks to enable translation and drug development by catalyzing exploration of biologically active chemical space. Here we discuss the opportunities and challenges surrounding the application of AI/ML to the exploration of novel biologically relevant chemical space as part of ASPIRE.",

For diagnostic imaging alone, the number of publications on AI has increased from about 100-150 per year in 2007-2008 to 1000-1100 per year in 2017-2018. Researchers have applied AI to automatically recognizing complex patterns in imaging data and providing quantitative assessments of radiographic characteristics. In radiation oncology, AI has been applied on different image modalities that are used at different stages of the treatment. ",

The sensitivity of the test in detecting abnormal cells is 67-75% in various studies. Owing to the volume of smears at cancer screening centres, significant man-hours are expended in the test. We have developed a software program for identification of foci of abnormal cells from conventional smears. We have chosen the convolutional neural network (CNN) model\u00a0for its efficacy in image classification.\nA total of 1838 microphotographs from cervical smears, containing 1301 'normal' foci and 537 'abnormal' foci were included in the study. The data set was split into training, testing and validation sets. A CNN was developed in the Python programming language. The CNN was trained with the training and testing set. At the end of training, 94.64% accuracy was achieved in the testing set. The CNN was then run on the validation set (441 images).\nThe CNN showed 94.28% sensitivity, 96.01% specificity, 91.66% positive predictive value and 97.30% negative predictive value. The CNN could recognise normal squamous cells, overlapping cells, neutrophils and debris and classify the focus appropriately. False positives were reported when the CNN failed to recognise overlapping cells (2.7% microphotographs). It could correctly label cell clusters with high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio and hyperchromasia. In 1.8% of microphotographs, a false negative was reported.\nThe CNN showed 95.46% diagnostic accuracy, suggesting potential use in screening.",

    "abstract": "Although prior theory suggests that rumination contributes to cognitive impairments associated with depression, recent work suggests that rumination is associated with higher levels of intelligence. The present study examined the relations between two ruminative subtypes (brooding and reflective pondering) and multiple measures and types of intelligence (verbal and performance) after controlling for rumination's overlapping variance with depression. Participants were 751 individuals from the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study who completed the Ruminative Response Scale; the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale and a fully structured clinical interview as measures of depression; and verbal and performance intelligence tasks at age 16 and the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices at age 23. Reflective pondering was positively associated with all measures of intelligence, whereas brooding was not associated with intelligence. Our findings indicate that any negative associations between rumination and intelligence are attributable to shared variance with depression, and that examination of rumination as a multifaceted construct may provide new insights into the relations between rumination and cognition.",

    "abstract": "The capacity for teams and organizations to evolve and to thrive in ever-shifting environments is attributed to their collective intelligence. Collectively, intelligent team could prevent repetition of past mistakes and can help organizations and people work more efficiently. Researchers aimed to find a framework or a tool that could help explain collective intelligence in primary healthcare organizations.\nThe framework was developed iteratively following a three-step process based on the Pragmatic utility concept analysis, each step fetching data from both literature and the team's expertise: (i) finding an existing framework, (ii) developing an initial framework, (iii) testing and refining the framework.\nA broad literature search led researchers to focus more specifically on two interrelated frameworks, both concepts were created within the educational field. We first adapted these concepts to healthcare teams, then to the increasing interdisciplinarity of primary healthcare teams. We also subdivided the framework into clinical or organizational domain. Finally, we performed a secondary analysis from existing data of a larger project that aimed to evaluate seven primary care teams in Quebec.\nThis first attempt to conceptualize collective intelligence in a way that is specific to primary healthcare teams helps identify strengths and areas in which teams could potentially improve. From a theoretical perspective, the framework facilitates understanding of the concept of collective intelligence in primary healthcare teams. Our current results show a strong potential for this tool, but other tests and systematic validations are to be expected in order to better link collective intelligence and team performance.",

    "abstract": "The detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is based on behavioral observations. To build a more objective datadriven method for screening and diagnosing ASD, many studies have attempted to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Therefore, the purpose of this literature review is to summarize the studies that used AI in the assessment process and examine whether other behavioral data could potentially be used to distinguish ASD characteristics.\nBased on our search and exclusion criteria, we reviewed 13 studies.\nTo improve the accuracy of outcomes, AI algorithms have been used to identify items in assessment instruments that are most predictive of ASD. Creating a smaller subset and therefore reducing the lengthy evaluation process, studies have tested the efficiency of identifying individuals with ASD from those without. Other studies have examined the feasibility of using other behavioral observational features as potential supportive data.\nWhile previous studies have shown high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in classifying ASD and non-ASD individuals, there remain many challenges regarding feasibility in the real-world that need to be resolved before AI methods can be fully integrated into the healthcare system as clinical decision support systems.",

    "abstract": "The Relational Abilities Index (RAI) has shown considerable utility as a functional proxy measurement of intellectual performance by providing a metric of an important skill set known as relational skills, which are proposed to underlie much of what we conceive of as intellectual behavior. The Relational Abilities Index+ (RAI+) assesses performance across an extended range of relational skills (Same/Opposite, More/Less, Same/Different, Before/After, and Analogy), and has been designed to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced assessment of relational skills. The current study aims to investigate the validity and utility of the RAI+ by assessing its degree of correlation with well-established assessments of intelligence (WASI), numeracy (WAIS: Arithmetic), and educational attainment (WIAT-T-II). Results indicate that the RAI+ displays considerable efficacy in predicting intellectual performance and numeracy, but not educational attainment.",

    "abstract": "The field of nanomedicine has made substantial strides in the areas of therapeutic and diagnostic development. For example, nanoparticle-modified drug compounds and imaging agents have resulted in markedly enhanced treatment outcomes and contrast efficiency. In recent years, investigational nanomedicine platforms have also been taken into the clinic, with regulatory approval for Abraxane\u00ae and other products being awarded. As the nanomedicine field has continued to evolve, multifunctional approaches have been explored to simultaneously integrate therapeutic and diagnostic agents onto a single particle, or deliver multiple nanomedicine-functionalized therapies in unison. Similar to the objectives of conventional combination therapy, these strategies may further improve treatment outcomes through targeted, multi-agent delivery that preserves drug synergy. Also, similar to conventional/unmodified combination therapy, nanomedicine-based drug delivery is often explored at fixed doses. A persistent challenge in all forms of drug administration is that drug synergy is time-dependent, dose-dependent and patient-specific at any given point of treatment. To overcome this challenge, the evolution towards nanomedicine-mediated co-delivery of multiple therapies has made the potential of interfacing artificial intelligence (AI) with nanomedicine to sustain optimization in combinatorial nanotherapy a reality. Specifically, optimizing drug and dose parameters in combinatorial nanomedicine administration is a specific area where AI can actionably realize the full potential of nanomedicine. To this end, this review will examine the role that AI can have in substantially improving nanomedicine-based treatment outcomes, particularly in the context of combination nanotherapy for both N-of-1 and population-optimized treatment.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) encompasses a wide variety of methods by which artificial intelligence learns to perform tasks when exposed to data. Although detection of myocardial infarction has been facilitated with introduction of troponins, the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) without myocardial damage (without elevation of serum troponin) remains subjective, and its accuracy remains highly dependent on clinical skills of the health care professionals. Application of a ML algorithm may expedite management of ACS for either early discharge or early initiation of ACS management. We aim to summarize the published studies of ML for diagnosis of ACS.\nWe searched electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from inception up to January 13, 2019, for studies that evaluated ML algorithms for the diagnosis of ACS in patients presenting with chest pain. We then used random-effects bivariate meta-analysis models to summarize the studies.\nWe retained 9 studies that evaluated ML in a total of 6292 patients. The prevalence of ACS in the evaluated cohorts ranged from relatively rare (7%) to common (57%). The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.95 and 0.90, respectively. The positive predictive values ranged from 0.64 to 1.0, and the negative predictive values ranged from 0.91 to 1.0. The positive and negative likelihood ratios ranged from 1.6 to 33.0 and 0.01 to 0.13, respectively.\nThe excellent sensitivity, negative likelihood ratio, and negative predictive values suggest that ML may be useful as an initial triage tool for ruling out ACS.",

    "abstract": "Blood lead level (BLL) is insufficiently sensitive for early detection of Lead-induced neurotoxicity (LIN). This study determined the possible role of the combination of BLL, intelligent quotient (IQ) and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the early detection of LIN in Children. Apparently healthy children (n=309) from eight public primary schools in Ibadan, Nigeria were recruited and classified into: children with Elevated BLL (EBLL) and children with Acceptable BLL (control) based on CDC cut-off for childhood lead exposure. Neurological indices (speech, memory, cranial nerves and cerebellar functions), IQ, BLL and erythrocyte AChE activity were assessed using standard methods, Standard Progressive Matrices, AAS and HPLC respectively. Statistical analysis involved Student's t-test, Pearson's correlation and multivariate regression. p<0.05 was considered significant. There were 169 (54.7%) children with EBLL while there were 140 (45.3%) control children. Both groups exhibited normal speech, memory, cranial nerves and cerebellar functions. However, IQ was lower in EBLL children (85.9\u00b111.6) compared with control (91.5\u00b114.0) while BLL and AChE activity were higher in EBLL children (0.4\u00b10.1 \u03bcmol/l; 117.5\u00b125.5 \u03bckat/l) compared with control (0.2\u00b10.0 \u03bcmol/l; 59.4\u00b110.2 \u03bckat/l).

The place of residence has an impact on social relations and socialization, which could effect with disparities in behaviour towards elderly patients.\nMedical University of Lublin students from rural (N=71; M=23.44 SD=1.80) and urban (N=87; M=23.34; SD=1.38) areas took part in the study. Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (INTE) and Attitude Towards Elderly Patients Questionnaire (ATEP) were used.\nThere are statistically significant differences between medical students from rural and urban areas in their attitude towards elderly patients (p=0.001), but no differences were observed between rural and urban residents in terms of emotional intelligence (general result, action factor and cognitive factor). Positive correlations were observed between action factor (r=0.322), cognitive factor (r=0.311) and general INTE result (r=0.358) and attitude towards elderly patients in the group of medical students from rural area.\nMedical students from rural areas are characterized by a more positive attitude towards elderly patients than medical students from urban areas. The predictors of attitudes towards elderly patients are the cognitive factor of emotional intelligence and the place of residence of medical students. The results give the opportunity to design a well-developed programme of a geriatric course which could be matched to the personal predispositions of students.",

    "abstract": "To explore attitudes about artificial intelligence (AI) among staff who utilized AI-based clinical decision support (CDS).\nA survey was designed to assess staff attitudes about AI-based CDS tools. The survey was anonymously and voluntarily completed by clinical staff in three primary care outpatient clinics before and after implementation of an AI-based CDS system aimed to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes as part of a quality improvement project. The CDS identified patients at risk for poor glycemic control and generated intervention recommendations intended to reduce patients' risk.\nStaff completed 45 surveys pre-intervention and 38 post-intervention. Following implementation, staff felt that care was better coordinated (11 favorable responses, 14 unfavorable responses pre-intervention; 21 favorable responses, 3 unfavorable responses post-intervention; p < 0.01). However, only 14 % of users would recommend the AI-based CDS. Staff feedback revealed that the most favorable aspect of the CDS was that it promoted team dialog about patient needs (N = 14, 52 %), and the least favorable aspect was inadequacy of the interventions recommended by the CDS.\nAI-based CDS tools that are perceived negatively by staff may reduce staff excitement about AI technology, and hands-on experience with AI may lead to more realistic expectations about the technology's capabilities. In our setting, although AI-based CDS prompted an interdisciplinary discussion about the needs of patients at high risk for poor glycemic control, the interventions recommended by the CDS were often perceived to be poorly tailored, inappropriate, or not useful. Developers should carefully consider tasks that are best performed by AI and those best performed by the patient's care team.",

    "abstract": "The purity of seeds is the most important factor in agriculture that determines crop yield, price, and quality. Rice is a major staple food consumed in different forms globally. The identification of high yielding and good quality paddy seeds is a challenging job and mainly dependent on expensive molecular techniques. The practical and day-to-day usage of the molecular-laboratory based techniques are very costly and time-consuming, and involves several logistical issues too. Moreover, such techniques are not easily accessible to paddy farmers. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop alternative, easily accessible and rapid methods for correct identification of paddy seed varieties, especially of commercial importance. We have developed iRSVPred, deep learning based on seed images, for the identification and differentiation of ten major varieties of basmati rice namely, Pusa basmati 1121 (1121), Pusa basmati 1509 (1509), Pusa basmati 1637 (1637), salt-tolerant basmati rice variety CSR 30 (CSR-30), Dehradoon basmati Type-3 (DHBT-3), Pusa Basmati-1 (PB-1), Pusa Basmati-6 (PB-6), Basmati -370 (BAS-370), Pusa Basmati 1718 (1718) and Pusa Basmati 1728 (1728). The method has an overall accuracy of 100% and 97% on the training set (total 61,632 images) and internal validation set (total 15,408 images), respectively. Furthermore, accuracies of greater than or equal to 80% have been achieved for all the ten varieties on the external validation dataset (642 images) used in the study. The iRSVPred web-server is freely available at http://14.139.62.220/rice/.",

    "abstract": "Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) is attracting much interest in medicine. Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black-box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of ",

    "abstract": "Data science and digital technologies have the potential to transform diagnostic classification. Digital technologies enable the collection of big data, and advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence enable scalable, rapid, and automated classification of medical conditions. In this review, we summarize and categorize various data-driven methods for diagnostic classification. In particular, we focus on autism as an example of a challenging disorder due to its highly heterogeneous nature. We begin by describing the frontier of data science methods for the neuropsychiatry of autism. We discuss early signs of autism as defined by existing pen-and-paper-based diagnostic instruments and describe data-driven feature selection techniques for determining the behaviors that are most salient for distinguishing children with autism from neurologically typical children. We then describe data-driven detection techniques, particularly computer vision and eye tracking, that provide a means of quantifying behavioral differences between cases and controls. We also describe methods of preserving the privacy of collected videos and prior efforts of incorporating humans in the diagnostic loop. Finally, we summarize existing digital therapeutic interventions that allow for data capture and longitudinal outcome tracking as the diagnosis moves along a positive trajectory. Digital phenotyping of autism is paving the way for quantitative psychiatry more broadly and will set the stage for more scalable, accessible, and precise diagnostic techniques in the field.",

    "abstract": "To quantify the central visual field (VF) loss patterns in glaucoma using artificial intelligence.\nRetrospective study.\nVFs of 8712 patients with 13 951 Humphrey 10-2 test results from 13 951 eyes for cross-sectional analyses, and 824 patients with at least 5 reliable 10-2 test results at 6-month intervals or more from 1191 eyes for longitudinal analyses.\nTotal deviation values were used to determine the central VF patterns using the most recent 10-2 test results. A 24-2 VF within a 3-month window of the 10-2 tests was used to stage eyes into mild, moderate, or severe functional loss using the Hodapp-Anderson-Parrish scale at baseline. Archetypal analysis was applied to determine the central VF patterns. Cross-validation was performed to determine the optimal number of patterns. Stepwise regression was applied to select the optimal feature combination of global indices, average baseline decomposition coefficients from central VFs archetypes, and other factors to predict central VF mean deviation (MD) slope based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).\nThe central VF patterns stratified by severity stage based on 24-2 test results and a model to predict the central VF MD change over time using baseline test results.\nFrom cross-sectional analysis, 17 distinct central VF patterns were determined for the 13 951 eyes across the spectrum of disease severity. These central VF patterns could be divided into isolated superior loss, isolated inferior loss, diffuse loss, and other loss patterns. Notably, 4 of the 5 patterns of diffuse VF loss preserved the less vulnerable inferotemporal zone, whereas they lost most of the remaining more vulnerable zone described by the Hood model. Inclusion of coefficients from central VF archetypical patterns strongly improved the prediction of central VF MD slope (BIC decrease, 35; BIC decrease of >6 indicating strong prediction improvement) than using only the global indices of 2 baseline VF results. Eyes with baseline VF results with more superonasal and inferonasal loss were more likely to show worsening MD over time.\nWe quantified central VF patterns in glaucoma, which were used to improve the prediction of central VF worsening compared with using only global indices.",

    "abstract": "Discussions surrounding the future of artificial intelligenc (AI) in healthcare often cause consternation among healthcare professionals. These feelings may stem from a lack of formal education on AI and how to be a leader of AI implementation in medical systems. To address this, our academic medical center hosted an educational summit exploring how to become a leader of AI in healthcare. This article presents three lessons learned from hosting this summit, thus providing guidance for developing medical curriculum on the topic of AI in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Unplanned groundwater exploitation in coastal aquifers results in water decline and consequently triggers saltwater intrusion (SWI). This study formulates a novel modeling strategy based on GALDIT method using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for mapping the vulnerability to SWI. This AI-based modeling strategy is a two-level learning process, where vulnerability to SWI at Level 1 can be predicted by such models as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Sugeno Fuzzy Logic (SFL), and Neuro-Fuzzy (NF); and their outputs serve as the input to the model at Level 2, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). This model is applied to Urmia aquifer, west coast of Lake Urmia, where both are currently declining. The construction of the above four models both at Levels 1 and 2 provide tools for mapping the SWI vulnerability of the study area. Model performances in the paper are studied using RMSE and R",

    "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is consistently associated with lower levels of educational attainment. A recent large genome-wide association study identified common gene variants associated with ADHD, but most of the genetic architecture remains unknown.\nWe analyzed independent genome-wide association study summary statistics for ADHD (19,099 cases and 34,194 controls), educational attainment (N\u00a0= 842,499), and general intelligence (N\u00a0= 269,867) using a conditional/conjunctional false discovery rate (FDR) statistical framework that increases power of discovery by conditioning the FDR on overlapping associations. The genetic variants identified were characterized in terms of function, expression, and biological processes.\nWe identified 58 linkage disequilibrium-independent ADHD-associated loci (conditional FDR < 0.01), of which 30 were shared between ADHD and educational attainment or general intelligence (conjunctional FDR < 0.01) and 46 were novel risk loci for ADHD.\nThese results expand on previous genetic and epidemiological studies and support the hypothesis of a shared genetic basis between these phenotypes. Although the clinical utility of the identified loci remains to be determined, they can be used as resources to guide future studies aiming to disentangle the complex etiologies of ADHD, educational attainment, and general intelligence.",

    "abstract": "The discipline of radiology and diagnostic imaging has evolved greatly in recent years. We have observed an exponential increase in the number of exams performed, subspecialization of medical fields, and increases in accuracy of the various imaging methods, making it a challenge for the radiologist to \"know everything about all exams and regions\". In addition, imaging exams are no longer only qualitative and diagnostic, providing now quantitative information on disease severity, as well as identifying biomarkers of prognosis and treatment response. In view of this, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed with the objective of complementing diagnostic imaging and helping the therapeutic decision-making process. With the advent of artificial intelligence, \"big data\", and machine learning, we are moving toward the rapid expansion of the use of these tools in daily life of physicians, making each patient unique, as well as leading radiology toward the concept of multidisciplinary approach and precision medicine. In this article, we will present the main aspects of the computational tools currently available for analysis of images and the principles of such analysis, together with the main terms and concepts involved, as well as examining the impact that the development of artificial intelligence has had on radiology and diagnostic imaging.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular conditions remain the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with genotype being a significant influence on disease risk. Cardiac imaging-genetics aims to identify and characterize the genetic variants that influence functional, physiological, and anatomical phenotypes derived from cardiovascular imaging. High-throughput DNA sequencing and genotyping have greatly accelerated genetic discovery, making variant interpretation one of the key challenges in contemporary clinical genetics. Heterogeneous, low-fidelity phenotyping and difficulties integrating and then analyzing large-scale genetic, imaging and clinical datasets using traditional statistical approaches have impeded process. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as deep learning, are particularly suited to tackle the challenges of scalability and high dimensionality of data and show promise in the field of cardiac imaging-genetics. Here we review the current state of AI as applied to imaging-genetics research and discuss outstanding methodological challenges, as the field moves from pilot studies to mainstream applications, from one dimensional global descriptors to high-resolution models of whole-organ shape and function, from univariate to multivariate analysis and from candidate gene to genome-wide approaches. Finally, we consider the future directions and prospects of AI imaging-genetics for ultimately helping understand the genetic and environmental underpinnings of cardiovascular health and disease.",

    "abstract": "A review of the scientific literature shows that many studies have analyzed the relationship between academic achievement and different psychological constructs, such as self-concept, personality, and emotional intelligence. The present work has two main objectives. First, to analyze the academic achievement, as well as the self-concept, personality and emotional intelligence, according to gender and cultural origin of the participants (European vs. Amazigh). Secondly, to identify what dimensions of self-concept, personality and emotional intelligence predict academic achievement. For this, a final sample consisting of 407 students enrolled in the last 2 years of Primary Education were utilized for the study. By gender, 192 were boys (47.2%) and 215 girls (52.8%), with an average age of 10.74 years old. By cultural group, 142 were of European origin (34.9%) and 265 of Amazigh origin (65.1%). The academic achievements were evaluated from the grades obtained in three school subjects: Natural Sciences, Spanish Language and Literature, and Mathematics, and the instruments used for data collection of the psychological constructs analyzed were the Self-Concept Test-Form 5, the Short-Form Big Five Questionnaire for Children, and the BarOn Emotional Quotient Inventory: Youth Version-Short. Based on the objectives set, first, the grades in the subject of Spanish Language and Literature varied depending on the gender of the students. Likewise, differences were found in self-concept, personality, and emotional intelligence according to gender. Also, the physical self-concept varied according to the cultural group. Regarding the second objective, in the predictive analysis for each of the subjects of the curriculum of Primary Education, the academic self-concept showed a greater predictive value. However, so did other dimensions of self-concept, personality and emotional intelligence. The need to carry out a comprehensive education in schools that addresses the promotion of not only academic but also personal and social competences is discussed. Also, that the study of the variables that affect gender differences must be deepened.",

    "abstract": "Body image dissatisfaction (BID) is related to an increased risk for various health issues including descreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL), the development of problematic eating behaviors and obesity. Previous research indicates that emotional intelligence is one important factor related to BID in adults. Whether this is the case in children, remains yet unknown. Taking this into consideration, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between BID and trait-based emotion intelligence (TEI) as well as HRQoL in female and male primary school children.\nTEI and BID were assessed via self-reports as well as HRQoL via parental reports in a large sample of 991 primary school children (429 girls) within the \"Baden W\u00fcrttemberg Study\", which evaluated the effectiveness of the health prevention programm \"Join the Healthy Boat\" in Southwestern Germany.\nOur findings demonstrated the interrelation between higher levels of TEI and lower levels of BID among girls and boys. Positive associations were found between better HRQoL, better intrapersonal and stress management abilites (subscales of TEI) and lower BID, as reflected by parental and self-reports.\nOur results reveal an interconnectivity between TEI, BID, and better HRQoL in female and male primary school children. Although the observed correlations were rather small, they nervertheless support the idea that TEI consists a key-factor for the self-regulation of health-related behavior. Prevention programs could benefit from including processes, that sough to improve aspects of emotional intelligence such as intrapersonal, interpersonal abilities, and adaptability, as an effort of preventing problematic habits or lifestyles that could lead to disordered eating behaviors as well as to obesity in middle childhood.",

    "abstract": "Different kinds of biological databases publicly available nowadays provide us a goldmine of multidiscipline big data. The Cancer Genome Atlas is a cancer database including detailed information of many patients with cancer. DrugBank is a database including detailed information of approved, investigational and withdrawn drugs, as well as other nutraceutical and metabolite structures. PubChem is a chemical compound database including all commercially available compounds as well as other synthesisable compounds. Protein Data Bank is a crystal structure database including X-ray, cryo-EM and nuclear magnetic resonance protein three-dimensional structures as well as their ligands. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an important role in the drug discovery progress. The integration of such big data and AI is making a great difference in the discovery of novel targeted drug. In this review, we focus on the currently available advanced methods for the discovery of highly effective lead compounds with great absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity properties.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the neural basis of intelligence have focused on comparing brain imaging variables with global scales instead of the cognitive domains integrating these scales or quotients. Here, the relation between mean tract-based fractional anisotropy (mTBFA) and intelligence indices was explored. Deterministic tractography was performed using a regions of interest approach for 10 white-matter fascicles along which the mTBFA was calculated. The study sample included 83 healthy individuals from the second wave of the Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project, whose WAIS-III intelligence quotients and indices were obtained. Inspired by the \"Watershed model\" of intelligence, we employed a regularized hierarchical Multiple Indicator, Multiple Causes model (MIMIC), to assess the association of mTBFA with intelligence scores, as mediated by latent variables summarizing the indices. Regularized MIMIC, used due to the limited sample size, selected relevant mTBFA by means of an elastic net penalty and achieved good fits to the data. Two latent variables were necessary to describe the indices: Fluid intelligence (Perceptual Organization and Processing Speed indices) and Crystallized Intelligence (Verbal Comprehension and Working Memory indices). Regularized MIMIC revealed effects of the forceps minor tract on crystallized intelligence and of the superior longitudinal fasciculus on fluid intelligence. The model also detected the significant effect of age on both latent variables.",

    "abstract": "Internalizing problems (depression, anxiety, social anxiety, somatic complaints, post-traumatic symptoms, and obsession-compulsion) are very important in adolescents' development. These problems can be related with people who lack social skills and poorly handle their emotions. This study assessed 1358 secondary education students (12-17\u2009years) to analyze the relationship linking internalizing problems, emotional intelligence, and social skills. The results showed not only how these constructs were related, but how students' internalizing problems varied according to their emotional intelligence and social skills. They also indicated that two in every three males, and just over one in every two females, obtained high scores for internalizing problems. The model showed a good fit: \u03c7",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) now plays a critical role in almost every area of our daily lives and academic disciplines due to the growth of computing power, advances in methods and techniques, and the explosion of the amount of data; medicine is not an exception. Rather than replacing clinicians, AI is augmenting the intelligence of clinicians in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions.\nKidney disease is a substantial medical and public health burden globally, with both acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease bringing about high morbidity and mortality as well as a huge economic burden. Even though the existing research and applied works have made certain contributions to more accurate prediction and better understanding of histologic pathology, there is a lot more work to be done and problems to solve.\nAI applications of diagnostics and prognostics for high-prevalence and high-morbidity types of nephropathy in medical-resource-inadequate areas need special attention; high-volume and high-quality data need to be collected and prepared; a consensus on ethics and safety in the use of AI technologies needs to be built.",

    "abstract": "Mining social media data for studying the human condition has created new and unique challenges. When analyzing social media data from marginalized communities, algorithms lack the ability to accurately interpret off-line context, which may lead to dangerous assumptions about and implications for marginalized communities. To combat this challenge, we hired formerly gang-involved young people as domain experts for contextualizing social media data in order to create inclusive, community-informed algorithms. Utilizing data from the Gang Intervention and Computer Science Project-a comprehensive analysis of Twitter data from gang-involved youth in Chicago-we describe the process of involving formerly gang-involved young people in developing a new part-of-speech tagger and content classifier for a prototype natural language processing system that detects aggression and loss in Twitter data. We argue that involving young people as domain experts leads to more robust understandings of context, including localized language, culture, and events. These insights could change how data scientists approach the development of corpora and algorithms that affect people in marginalized communities and who to involve in that process. We offer a contextually driven interdisciplinary approach between social work and data science that integrates domain insights into the training of qualitative annotators and the production of algorithms for positive social impact.",

    "abstract": "Despite the reliability of intelligence measures in predicting important life outcomes such as educational achievement and mortality, the exact configuration and neural correlates of cognitive abilities remain poorly understood, especially in childhood and adolescence. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the factorial structure and neural substrates of child and adolescent intelligence using two cross-sectional, developmental samples (CALM: N\u202f=\u202f551 (N\u202f=\u202f165 imaging), age range: 5-18 years, NKI-Rockland: N\u202f=\u202f337 (N\u202f=\u202f65 imaging), age range: 6-18 years). In a preregistered analysis, we used structural equation modelling (SEM) to examine the neurocognitive architecture of individual differences in childhood and adolescent cognitive ability. In both samples, we found that cognitive ability in lower and typical-ability cohorts is best understood as two separable constructs, crystallized and fluid intelligence, which became more distinct across development, in line with the age differentiation hypothesis. Further analyses revealed that white matter microstructure, most prominently the superior longitudinal fasciculus, was strongly associated with crystallized (gc) and fluid (gf) abilities. Finally, we used SEM trees to demonstrate evidence for developmental reorganization of gc and gf and their white matter substrates such that the relationships among these factors dropped between 7-8 years before increasing around age 10. Together, our results suggest that shortly before puberty marks a pivotal phase of change in the neurocognitive architecture of intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Regenerating lost or damaged tissue is the primary goal of Tissue Engineering. 3D bioprinting technologies have been widely applied in many research areas of tissue regeneration and disease modeling with unprecedented spatial resolution and tissue-like complexity. However, the extraction of tissue architecture and the generation of high-resolution blueprints are challenging tasks for tissue regeneration. Traditionally, such spatial information is obtained from a collection of microscopic images and then combined together to visualize regions of interest. To fabricate such engineered tissues, rendered microscopic images are transformed to code to inform a 3D bioprinting process. If this process is augmented with data-driven approaches and streamlined with machine intelligence, identification of an optimal blueprint can become an achievable task for functional tissue regeneration. In this review, our perspective is guided by an emerging paradigm to generate a blueprint for regeneration with machine intelligence. First, we reviewed recent articles with respect to our perspective for machine intelligence-driven information retrieval and fabrication. After briefly introducing recent trends in information retrieval methods from publicly available data, our discussion is focused on recent works that use machine intelligence to discover tissue architectures from imaging and spectral data. Then, our focus is on utilizing optimization approaches to increase print fidelity and enhance biomimicry with machine learning (ML) strategies to acquire a blueprint ready for 3D bioprinting.",

    "abstract": "The primary aim of the current study was to develop a multi-methodological teacher training program based on emotional intelligence (EI) as a key competency in order to improve student academic achievement based on two methods: face-to-face instruction and game-based e-learning instruction.\nSeventy-four primary education teachers and their 2069 students were randomly assigned to three groups. The first group of teachers (\nImplementation of EI into classroom teaching effectively improved academic achievement in primary school students using both methods. However, there was a greater increase in academic achievement and higher teacher satisfaction in the game-based e-learning group. No significant differences in student achievement were observed in the control group.\nEmotional intelligence as a key academic competency.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that aims to mimic human thought processes. AI techniques have been applied in cardiovascular medicine to explore novel genotypes and phenotypes in existing diseases, improve the quality of patient care, enabling cost-effectiveness, and reducing readmission and mortality rates. The potential of AI in cardiovascular medicine is tremendous; however, ignorance of the challenges may overshadow its potential clinical impact. This paper gives a glimpse of AI's application in cardiovascular clinical care and discusses its potential role in facilitating precision cardiovascular medicine.",

    "abstract": "Usable tools to support individual primary care clinicians in their diagnostic processes could help to reduce preventable harm from diagnostic errors. We conducted a formative study with primary care providers to identify key requisites to optimize the acceptability of 1 online collective intelligence platform (Human Diagnosis Project; Human Dx).\nWe conducted semistructured interviews with practicing primary care clinicians in a sample of the US community-based clinics to examine the acceptability and early usability of the collective intelligence online platform using standardized clinical cases and real-world clinical cases from the participants' own practice. We used an integrated inductive-deductive qualitative analysis approach to analyze the interview transcripts.\nPerceived usefulness, perceived accuracy, quality assurance, trust, and ease of use emerged as essential domains of acceptability required for providers to use a collective intelligence tool in clinical practice. Participants conveyed that the collective opinion should: (1) contribute to their clinical reasoning, (2) boost their confidence, (3) be generated in a timely manner, and (4) be relevant to their clinical settings and use cases. Trust in the technology platform and the clinical accuracy of its collective intelligence output emerged as an incontrovertible requirement for user acceptance and engagement.\nWe documented key requisites to building a collective intelligence technology platform that is trustworthy, useful, and acceptable to target end users for assistance in the diagnostic process. These key lessons may be applicable to other provider-facing decision support platforms.",

    "abstract": "The present study was designed to compare emotional intelligence (EI) and cognitive performance between patients with systolic heart failure (SHF), patients with diastolic heart failure (DHF) and healthy individuals (HI). Also to further examine the relationship between EI and cognition in patients with heart failure (HF). From April 2016 until April 2017, 96 patients diagnosed with SHF, 96 with DHF from Bahawal Victoria Hospital and Nishter Hospital, Bahawalpur and another 96 HI took part in the study in from Pakistan. Participants completed BarOn Emotional Quotient Inventory and Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The results showed that patients with HF had impaired EI and cognition in contrast to HI. In comparison, patients with SHF were more impaired on EI and cognition as compared with DHF patients. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and EI were significant predictors of cognitive per formance in patients with HF. In conclusion, high SBP and low EI are significant markers of cognitive deficits in HF.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of increasing rates of interstate educational migration of student youth exacerbates the problems of psychological adaptation and socialization of foreign students in the context of the recipient country\u2019s society. The aim is to study the peculiarities of emotional intelligence changes in the process of social adaptation of foreign students of Ukrainian higher educational institutions of medical profile in the conditions of educational migration.\nThere were formed the observational groups of foreign students, natives from different countries, varying in linguistic affiliation and religion. In the research the Hall Emotional Intelligence Test (EQ test) was used, which gave an opportunity to evaluate the dynamics of emotional intelligence development in the process of learning and social adaptation in relation to the first and last courses at a medical higher education institution.\nAs a result of the conducted researches it is possible to notice a marked increase of the level of emotional intelligence in the process of education and socialization of different ethnic groups of foreign students in Ukraine. At initial values in the first year of study (within 30,0-38 points), which is treated as \u201clow\u201d level, after the end of the sixth course of study this indicator increased to values of 59-72 points, which falls within the limits of values of \u201caverage\u201d, and even \u201chigh\u201d in English speaking educational groups (Ghana, Nigeria, Sudan). The obtained data have a statistical probability (p <0.05). It is especially important to emphasize the growth of more than 2 times the components of emotional intelligence on the scales \u201cempathy\u201d and \u201cmanagement of other people, emotions\u201d which are crucial for the successful fulfillment of their professional duties as a doctor. At these scales, the indicators reached the \u201chigh\u201d level at statistical probability (p <0.05). First-year students from Arab countries had the lowest baseline on the scale of \u201cmanaging of one\u2019s emotions\u201d (5.9 +0.4), which led to a sufficiently large number of manifestations of deviant behavior, but by the end of the sixth course, this indicator increased to values 10.0+ 0.9 (p <0.05). Accordingly, the deviance of behavioral responses has decreased significantly.\nIn our view, it is expedient to deepen the theoretical analysis of the social-psychological portrait of migrant students with the aim of their effective psychological and pedagogical support in the process of adaptation and assistance while building a professional perspective on the basis of effective development of emotional intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Futurists have predicted that new autonomous technologies, embedded with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), will lead to substantial job losses in many sectors disrupting many aspects of healthcare. Mental health appears ripe for such disruption given the global illness burden, stigma, and shortage of care providers.\nTo characterize the global psychiatrist community's opinion regarding the potential of future autonomous technology (referred to here as AI/ML) to replace key tasks carried out in mental health practice.\nCross sectional, random stratified sample of psychiatrists registered with Sermo, a global networking platform open to verified and licensed physicians.\nWe measured opinions about the likelihood that AI/ML tools would be able to fully replace - not just assist - the average psychiatrist in performing 10 key psychiatric tasks. Among those who considered replacement likely, we measured opinions about how many years from now such a capacity might emerge. We also measured psychiatrist's perceptions about whether benefits of AI/ML would outweigh the risks.\nSurvey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries representing North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Only 3.8 % of respondents felt it was likely that future technology would make their jobs obsolete and only 17 % felt that future AI/ML was likely to replace a human clinician for providing empathetic care. Documenting and updating medical records (75 %) and synthesizing information (54 %) were the two tasks where a majority predicted that AI/ML could fully replace human psychiatrists. Female- and US-based doctors were more uncertain that the benefits of AI would outweigh risks than male- and non-US doctors, respectively. Around one in 2 psychiatrists did however predict that their jobs would be substantially changed by AI/ML.\nOur findings provide compelling insights into how physicians think about AI/ML which in turn may help us better integrate technology and reskill doctors to enhance mental health care.",

    "abstract": "The general public's attitudes, demands, and expectations regarding medical AI could provide guidance for the future development of medical AI to satisfy the increasing needs of doctors and patients. The objective of this study is to investigate public perceptions, receptivity, and demands regarding the implementation of medical AI. An online questionnaire was designed to investigate the perceptions, receptivity, and demands of general public regarding medical AI between October 13 and October 30, 2018. The distributions of the current achievements, public perceptions, receptivity, and demands among individuals in different lines of work (i.e., healthcare vs non-healthcare) and different age groups were assessed by performing descriptive statistics. The factors associated with public receptivity of medical AI were assessed using a linear regression model. In total, 2,780 participants from 22 provinces were enrolled. Healthcare workers accounted for 54.3 % of all participants. There was no significant difference between the healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers in the high proportion (99 %) of participants expressing acceptance of AI (p = 0.8568), but remarkable distributional differences were observed in demands (p < 0.001 for both demands for AI assistance and the desire for AI improvements) and perceptions (p < 0.001 for safety, validity, trust, and expectations). High levels of receptivity (approximately 100 %), demands (approximately 80 %), and expectations (100 %) were expressed among different age groups. The receptivity of medical AI among the non-healthcare workers was associated with gender, educational qualifications, and demands and perceptions of AI. There was a very large gap between current availability of and public demands for intelligence services (p < 0.001). More than 90 % of healthcare workers expressed a willingness to devote time to learning about AI and participating in AI research. The public exhibits a high level of receptivity regarding the implementation of medical AI. To date, the achievements have been rewarding, and further advancements are required to satisfy public demands. There is a strong demand for intelligent assistance in many medical areas, including imaging and pathology departments, outpatient services, and surgery. More contributions are imperative to facilitate integrated and advantageous implementation in medical AI.",

    "abstract": "Preserving cognition and mental capacity is critical to aging with autonomy. Early detection of pathological cognitive decline facilitates the greatest impact of restorative or preventative treatments. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare is the use of computational algorithms that mimic human cognitive functions to analyze complex medical data. AI technologies like machine learning (ML) support the integration of biological, psychological, and social factors when approaching diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of disease. This paper serves to acquaint clinicians and other stakeholders with the use, benefits, and limitations of AI for predicting, diagnosing, and classifying mild and major neurocognitive impairments, by providing a conceptual overview of this topic with emphasis on the features explored and AI techniques employed. We present studies that fell into six categories of features used for these purposes: (1) sociodemographics; (2) clinical and psychometric assessments; (3) neuroimaging and neurophysiology; (4) electronic health records and claims; (5) novel assessments (e.g., sensors for digital data); and (6) genomics/other omics. For each category we provide examples of AI approaches, including supervised and unsupervised ML, deep learning, and natural language processing. AI technology, still nascent in healthcare, has great potential to transform the way we diagnose and treat patients with neurocognitive disorders.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by state-of-the-art performances across a wide variety of areas, over the last few years Machine Learning has drawn a significant amount of attention from the healthcare domain. Despite their potential in enabling person-alized medicine applications, the adoption of Deep Learning based solutions in clinical workflows has been hindered in many cases by the strict regulations concerning the privacy of patient health data. We propose a solution that relies on Fully Homomorphic Encryption, particularly on the MORE scheme, as a mechanism for enabling computations on sensitive health data, without revealing the underlying data. The chosen variant of the encryption scheme allows for the computations in the Neural Network model to be directly performed on floating point numbers, while incurring a reasonably small computational overhead. For feasibility evaluation, we demonstrate on the MNIST digit recognition task that Deep Learning can be performed on encrypted data without compromising the accuracy. We then address a more complex task by training a model on encrypted data to estimate the outputs of a whole-body circulation (WBC) model. These results underline the potential of the proposed approach to outperform current solutions by delivering comparable results to the unencrypted Deep Learning based solutions, in a reasonable amount of time. Lastly, the security aspects of the encryption scheme are analyzed, and we show that, even though the chosen encryption scheme favors performance and utility at the cost of weaker security, it can still be used in certain practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Regular nutrient intake monitoring in hospitalised patients plays a critical role in reducing the risk of disease-related malnutrition (DRM). Although several methods to estimate nutrient intake have been developed, there is still a clear demand for a more reliable and fully automated technique, as this could improve the data accuracy and reduce both the participant burden and the health costs. In this paper, we propose a novel system based on artificial intelligence to accurately estimate nutrient intake, by simply processing RGB depth image pairs captured before and after a meal consumption. For the development and evaluation of the system, a dedicated and new database of images and recipes of 322 meals was assembled, coupled to data annotation using innovative strategies. With this database, a system was developed that employed a novel multi-task neural network and an algorithm for 3D surface construction. This allowed sequential semantic food segmentation and estimation of the volume of the consumed food, and permitted fully automatic estimation of nutrient intake for each food type with a 15% estimation error.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The mainstay of breast cancer workup is histopathological diagnosis - which guides therapy and prognosis. However, emerging knowledge about the complex nature of cancer and the availability of tailored therapies have exposed opportunities for improvements in diagnostic precision. In parallel, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) along with the growing digitization of pathology slides for the primary diagnosis are a promising approach to meet the demand for more accurate detection, classification and prediction of behaviour of breast tumours. In this article, we cover the current and prospective uses of AI in digital pathology for breast cancer, review the basics of digital pathology and AI, and outline outstanding challenges in the field.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacovigilance (PV) detects, assesses, and prevents adverse events (AEs) and other drug-related problems by collecting, evaluating, and acting upon AEs. The volume of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) increases yearly, but it is estimated that more than 90% of AEs go unreported. In this landscape, embracing assistive technologies at scale becomes necessary to obtain a higher yield of AEs, to maintain compliance, and transform the PV professional work life.\nThe aim of this study was to identify areas across the PV value chain that can be augmented by cognitive service solutions using the methodologies of contextual analysis and cognitive load theory. It will also provide a framework of how to validate these PV cognitive services leveraging the acceptable quality limit approach.\nThe data used to train the cognitive service were an annotated corpus consisting of 20,000 ICSRS from which we developed a framework to identify and validate 40 cognitive services ranging from information extraction to complex decision making. This framework addresses the following shortcomings: (1) needing subject-matter expertise (SME) to match the artificial intelligence (AI) model predictions to the gold standard, commonly referred to as 'ground truth' in the AI space, (2) ground truth inconsistencies, (3) automated validation of prediction missing context, and (4) auto-labeling causing inaccurate test accuracy. The method consists of (1) conducting contextual analysis, (2) assessing human cognitive\u00a0workload,\u00a0(3) determining decision points for applying artificial intelligence (AI), (4) defining the scope of the data, or annotated corpus required for training and validation of the cognitive services, (5) identifying and standardizing PV knowledge elements, (6) developing cognitive services, and (7) reviewing and validating cognitive services.\nBy applying the framework, we (1) identified 51 decision points as candidates for AI use, (2) standardized the process to make PV knowledge explicit, (3) embedded SMEs in the process to preserve PV knowledge and context, (4) standardized acceptability by using established quality inspection principles, and (5) validated a total of 126 cognitive services.\nThe value of using AI methodologies in PV is compelling; however, as PV is highly regulated, acceptability will require assurances of quality, consistency, and standardization. We are proposing a foundational framework that the industry can use to identify and validate services to better support the gathering of quality data and to better serve the PV professional.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence demonstrated its value for automated contouring of organs at risk and target volumes as well as for auto-planning of radiation dose distributions in terms of saving time, increasing consistency, and improving dose-volumes parameters. Future developments include incorporating dose/outcome data to optimise dose distributions with optimal coverage of the high-risk areas, while at the same time limiting doses to low-risk areas. An infinite gradient of volumes and doses to deliver spatially-adjusted radiation can be generated, allowing to avoid unnecessary radiation to organs at risk. Therefore, data about patient-, tumour-, and treatment-related factors have to be combined with dose distributions and outcome-containing databases.",

    "abstract": "Malignant melanoma can most successfully be cured when diagnosed at an early stage in the natural history. However, there is controversy over screening programs and many advocate screening only for high-risk individuals.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of an artificial intelligence neural network (Deep Ensemble for Recognition of Melanoma [DERM]) to identify malignant melanoma from dermoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions and to show how this compared to doctors' performance assessed by meta-analysis.\nDERM was trained and tested using 7,102 dermoscopic images of both histologically confirmed melanoma (24%) and benign pigmented lesions (76%). A meta-analysis was conducted of studies examining the accuracy of naked-eye examination, with or without dermoscopy, by specialist and general physicians whose clinical diagnosis was compared to histopathology. The meta-analysis was based on evaluation of 32,226 pigmented lesions including 3,277 histopathology-confirmed malignant melanoma cases. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to examine and compare the diagnostic accuracy.\nDERM achieved a ROC area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.92-0.94), and sensitivity and specificity of 85.0% and 85.3%, respectively. Avoidance of false-negative results is essential, so different decision thresholds were examined. At 95% sensitivity DERM achieved a specificity of 64.1% and at 95% specificity the sensitivity was 67%. The meta-analysis showed primary care physicians (10 studies) achieve an AUC of 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.79-0.86), with sensitivity and specificity of 79.9% and 70.9%; and dermatologists (92 studies) 0.91 (0.88-0.93), 87.5%, and 81.4%, respectively.\nDERM has the potential to be used as a decision support tool in primary care, by providing dermatologist-grade recommendation on the likelihood of malignant melanoma.",

Avoidance of false-negative results is essential, so different decision thresholds were examined. At 95% sensitivity DERM achieved a specificity of 64.1% and at 95% specificity the sensitivity was 67%. The meta-analysis showed primary care physicians (10 studies) achieve an AUC of 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.79-0.86), with sensitivity and specificity of 79.9% and 70.9%; and dermatologists (92 studies) 0.91 (0.88-0.93), 87.5%, and 81.4%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Empirical sciences in general and psychological science in particular are plagued by replicability problems and biased published effect sizes. Although dissemination bias-related phenomena such as publication bias, time-lag bias, or visibility bias are well-known and have been intensively studied, another variant of effect distorting mechanisms, so-called decline effects, have not. Conceptually, decline effects are rooted in low initial (exploratory) study power due to strategic researcher behavior and can be expected to yield overproportional effect declines. Although decline effects have been documented in individual meta-analytic investigations, systematic evidence for decline effects in the psychological literature remains to date unavailable. Therefore, we present in this meta-meta-analysis a systematic investigation of the decline effect in intelligence research. In all, data from 22 meta-analyses comprising 36 meta-analytical and 1,391 primary effect sizes (",

    "abstract": "The Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests and the corresponding psychometric explanations dominate both the scientific and popular views about human intelligence. Though the IQ tests have been in currency for long, there exists a gap in what they are believed to measure and what they do. While the IQ tests index the quality of cognitive functioning in selected domains of mental repertoire, the applied settings often inflate their predictive value leading to an interpretive gap. The present article contends that studying the influence of motivational and affective processes on cognitive functioning would help to evolve a more psychologically comprehensive account of the IQ tests and bridge the interpretive gap. To conclude, the article suggests possible future research directions that could strengthen the predictive value of the IQ tests.",

    "abstract": "The current study investigates the relations among teachers' trait emotional intelligence, internal and external social support, and their levels of burnout. We hypothesized that both emotional intelligence and teachers' perceived social support were associated with low level of teachers' burnout. We further expected that internal and external support mediated the relationship between trait emotional intelligence and burnout scores. Participants were 318 in-service Italian teachers. The structural equation modeling analysis supports the idea that teachers' trait emotional intelligence is strongly and directly associated with their burnout. Furthermore, internal social support (from the teachers' workplace relationships) was more effective on burnout than support forthcoming from their external context. On the contrary, the mediation hypothesis was partially supported by the empirical data. These findings shed light on the relationship between teachers' emotional competence and their burnout experience at school.",

    "abstract": "How does emotional intelligence (EI) affect job performance and job burnout? Direct or indirect? What role does psychological capital play? This study surveyed 450 employees of various enterprises through questionnaires. Results are as follows: (1) Employees' EI has a positive predictive effect on psychological capital and job performance, and it is negatively correlated with job burnout; (2) psychological capital has a negative predictive effect on job burnout and a positive predictive effect on job performance; and (3) psychological capital plays a mediating role in the relationship between EI and job burnout/performance. Results of this study may contribute to develop EI theories in organizational behavior field. As for enterprises, improving the EI of employees will help to improve their psychological capital, and high psychological capital will lead to positive job performance and less job burnout.",

Different occupations, however, require different skills, abilities, activities, credentials, work styles, etc., constituting a rich multidimensional formative exposure with likely consequences for brain development over the lifespan. In the current study, we were interested in how different occupations with their different attributes relate to five variables: structural brain health, duration of early-life education, gender, IQ, and age, although the main focus was the relationship to brain health.

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence is an important factor contributing to social adaptation. The current study investigated how salivary testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) levels, cognitive control of emotional conflict processing were associated with children's emotional intelligence (EI). Thirty-four 10- to 11-year-old children were enrolled and instructed to complete questionnaires on emotional intelligence as well as empirical tasks of emotional flanker and Stroop with event-related potential (ERP) recordings. Saliva collection took place on another day without ERP tasks. Results showed that lower T and C levels were associated with higher accuracy in emotional conflict tasks, as well as better emotional intelligence (managing self emotions). In the Stroop task, higher T/C ratios were associated with greater congruency effects of N2 latencies, and lower cortisol levels correlated with stronger slow potential activities (SP). For girls, the correlation between cortisol and emotional utilization was mediated by the SP amplitudes on fearful conflicts in the flanker task (95% CI: -8.64, -0.54, ",

    "abstract": "The use of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning in basic research and clinical neuroscience is increasing. AI methods enable the interpretation of large multimodal datasets that can provide unbiased insights into the fundamental principles of brain function, potentially paving the way for earlier and more accurate detection of brain disorders and better informed intervention protocols. Despite AI's ability to create accurate predictions and classifications, in most cases it lacks the ability to provide a mechanistic understanding of how inputs and outputs relate to each other. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a new set of techniques that attempts to provide such an understanding, here we report on some of these practical approaches. We discuss the potential value of XAI to the field of neurostimulation for both basic scientific inquiry and therapeutic purposes, as well as, outstanding questions and obstacles to the success of the XAI approach.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven computational approaches have evolved to enable extraction of information from medical images with a reliability, accuracy and speed which is already transforming their interpretation and exploitation in clinical practice. While similar benefits are longed for in the field of interventional imaging, this ambition is challenged by a much higher heterogeneity. Clinical workflows within interventional suites and operating theatres are extremely complex and typically rely on poorly integrated intra-operative devices, sensors, and support infrastructures. Taking stock of some of the most exciting developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence for computer assisted interventions, we highlight the crucial need to take context and human factors into account in order to address these challenges. Contextual artificial intelligence for computer assisted intervention, or CAI4CAI, arises as an emerging opportunity feeding into the broader field of surgical data science. Central challenges being addressed in CAI4CAI include how to integrate the ensemble of prior knowledge and instantaneous sensory information from experts, sensors and actuators; how to create and communicate a faithful and actionable shared representation of the surgery among a mixed human-AI actor team; how to design interventional systems and associated cognitive shared control schemes for online uncertainty-aware collaborative decision making ultimately producing more precise and reliable interventions.",

    "abstract": "This review presents the developments in artificial intelligence technologies for environmental pollution controls. A number of AI approaches, which start with the reliable mapping of nonlinear behavior between inputs and outputs in chemical and biological processes in terms of prediction models to the emerging optimization and control algorithms that study the pollutants removal processes and intelligent control systems, have been developed for environmental clean-ups. The characteristics, advantages and limitations of AI methods, including single and hybrid AI methods, were overviewed. Hybrid AI methods exhibited synergistic effects, but with computational heaviness. The up-to-date review summarizes i) Various artificial neural networks employed in wastewater degradation process for the prediction of removal efficiency of pollutants and the search of optimizing experimental conditions; ii) Evaluation of fuzzy logic used for intelligent control of aerobic stage of wastewater treatment process; iii) AI-aided soft-sensors for precisely on-line/off-line estimation of hard-to-measure parameters in wastewater treatment plants; iv) Single and hybrid AI methods applied to estimate pollutants concentrations and design monitoring and early-warning systems for both aquatic and atmospheric environments; v) AI modelings of short-term, mid-term and long-term solid waste generations, and various ANNs for solid waste recycling and reduction. Finally, the future challenges of AI-based models employed in the environmental fields are discussed and proposed.",

    "abstract": "This study uses an explanatory model of the dimensions of leadership and emotional intelligence according to the methods used in particular teaching environments (universities and other educational institutions). The effect of different kinds of leadership on emotional intelligence dimensions is also established using an explanatory model. A total of 954 teachers participated in this cross-sectional study, teaching in 137 different schools/universities. The instruments used for the data collection were the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ-5) and the Trait Meta Mood Scale (TMMS-24). Data analysis was performed with the software IBM AMOS 23.0. (International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) using multi-group analysis and structural equations. Results showed that the structural equation model had a good fit. Transformational leadership depends mainly on intellectual stimulation in university teachers, whereas intrinsic motivation is more relevant at the lower educational levels. In relation to transactional leadership, contingency reward has a greater regression weight in non-university education, whereas passive leadership is governed more by passive exception in university teachers. There was a positive and direct relationship between levels of emotional intelligence and transformational leadership in non-university teachers, which reveals the need for effective understanding and management of both one's own and students' emotions in order to act effectively as a leader. Transactional leadership was negatively related to some emotional intelligence dimensions, given the relevance of obtaining power in this dimension.",

    "abstract": "To clarify the mechanisms of diseases, such as cancer, studies analyzing genetic mutations have been actively conducted for a long time, and a large number of achievements have already been reported. Indeed, genomic medicine is considered the core discipline of precision medicine, and currently, the clinical application of cutting-edge genomic medicine aimed at improving the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of diseases is promoted. However, although the Human Genome Project was completed in 2003 and large-scale genetic analyses have since been accomplished worldwide with the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS), explaining the mechanism of disease onset only using genetic variation has been recognized as difficult. Meanwhile, the importance of epigenetics, which describes inheritance by mechanisms other than the genomic DNA sequence, has recently attracted attention, and, in particular, many studies have reported the involvement of epigenetic deregulation in human cancer. So far, given that genetic and epigenetic studies tend to be accomplished independently, physiological relationships between genetics and epigenetics in diseases remain almost unknown. Since this situation may be a disadvantage to developing precision medicine, the integrated understanding of genetic variation and epigenetic deregulation appears to be now critical. Importantly, the current progress of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as machine learning and deep learning, is remarkable and enables multimodal analyses of big omics data. In this regard, it is important to develop a platform that can conduct multimodal analysis of medical big data using AI as this may accelerate the realization of precision medicine. In this review, we discuss the importance of genome-wide epigenetic and multiomics analyses using AI in the era of precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Recent interest in medical artificial intelligence (AI) has increased with onset of the fourth industrial revolution. Real-time monitoring of patients is an important research area of medical AI. The medical AI is very closely related to the Internet of Things (IoT), a core element of the fourth industrial revolution. Attempts to diagnose and treat patients using IoT have been already applied to patients with chronic disease such as hypertension and arrhythmia. However, in the spine, research on IoT and digital biomarkers are still in the early stages. The digital biomarker obtained by IoT devices is objective and could represent real-time, real-world, and abundant data. Based on its characteristics, IoT and digital biomarkers can also be useful in the spine. Currently, research on real-time monitoring of physical activity or spinal posture is ongoing. Therefore, the authors introduce the basic concepts of IoT and digital biomarkers, their relationship to AI, and recent trends. Current and future perspectives of IoT and digital biomarker in spine are also discussed. In the future, it is expected that IoT, digital biomarkers, and AI will lead to a paradigm shift in the diagnosis and treatment of spinal diseases.",

Moir\u00e9 topography, which describes the 3-dimensional surface of the trunk with band patterns, has been used to screen students for scoliosis, but the interpretation of the band patterns can be ambiguous. Thus, we created a scoliosis screening system that estimates spinal alignment, the Cobb angle, and vertebral rotation from moir\u00e9 images. In our system, a convolutional neural network (CNN) estimates the positions of 12 thoracic and 5 lumbar vertebrae, 17 spinous processes, and the vertebral rotation angle of each vertebra. We used this information to estimate the Cobb angle. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the estimated vertebral positions was 3.6 pixels (~5.4 mm) per person. T1 and L5 had smaller MAEs than the other levels. The MAE per person between the Cobb angle measured by doctors and the estimated Cobb angle was 3.42\u00b0. The MAE was 4.38\u00b0 in normal spines, 3.13\u00b0 in spines with a slight deformity, and 2.74\u00b0 in spines with a mild to severe deformity. The MAE of the angle of vertebral rotation was 2.9\u00b0\u00b11.4\u00b0, and was smaller when the deformity was milder. The proposed method of estimating the Cobb angle and AVR from moir\u00e9 images using a CNN is expected to enhance the accuracy of scoliosis screening.",

    "abstract": "Adult spinal deformity (ASD) is a complex disease that significantly affects the lives of many patients. Surgical correction has proven to be effective in achieving improvement of spinopelvic parameters as well as improving quality of life (QoL) for these patients. However, given the relatively high complication risk associated with ASD correction, it is of paramount importance to develop robust prognostic tools for predicting risk profile and outcomes. Historically, statistical models such as linear and logistic regression models were used to identify preoperative factors associated with postoperative outcomes. While these tools were useful for looking at simple associations, they represent generalizations across large populations, with little applicability to individual patients. More recently, predictive analytics utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) through machine learning for comprehensive processing of large amounts of data have become available for surgeons to implement. The use of these computational techniques has given surgeons the ability to leverage far more accurate and individualized predictive tools to better inform individual patients regarding predicted outcomes after ASD correction surgery. Applications range from predicting QoL measures to predicting the risk of major complications, hospital readmission, and reoperation rates. In addition, AI has been used to create a novel classification system for ASD patients, which will help surgeons identify distinct patient subpopulations with unique risk-benefit profiles. Overall, these tools will help surgeons tailor their clinical practice to address patients' individual needs and create an opportunity for personalized medicine within spine surgery.",

    "abstract": "Sense of coherence (SOC) reflects an individual's capacity and available resources to deal with stressful situations. For some time now studies have revealed that people differ in their experience of SOC; yet, very little is known about how and through which mechanisms a high level of SOC is formed. In order to increase our understanding about the paths to a high SOC in the stage of adulthood, we focused on exploring the role both of temperament, as it has been confirmed as a potential component in the development of more complex traits that emerge later in life, and of emotional intelligence (EI) as it has been found to increase SOC. The sample consisted of 173 participants between 18 and 49. We used the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A), Orientation to Life Questionnaire (OLQ), and Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (INTE). Results showed a negative correlation between the depressive, cyclothymic, irritable, and anxious dimensions of temperament and SOC, and EI. There was also a positive correlation between hyperthymic temperament and SOC, and EI. EI correlated positively with a general sense of coherence and its three dimensions. The PROCESS macro for SPSS showed that emotional intelligence mediates the relationship between depressive, cyclothymic, hyperthymic, irritable and anxious temperament, comprehensibility, manageability, meaningfulness, and global orientation to life. On the basis of the obtained outcomes, it can be stated that emotional intelligence mediates the relationship between dimensions of temperament and dimensions of SOC.",

    "abstract": "Eye surgery, specifically retinal micro-surgery involves sensory and motor skill that approaches human boundaries and physiological limits for steadiness, accuracy, and the ability to detect the small forces involved. Despite assumptions as to the benefit of robots in surgery and also despite great development effort, numerous challenges to the full development and adoption of robotic assistance in surgical ophthalmology, remain. Historically, the first in-human-robot-assisted retinal surgery occurred nearly 30\u00a0years after the first experimental papers on the subject. Similarly, artificial intelligence emerged decades ago and it is only now being more fully realized in ophthalmology. The delay between conception and application has in part been due to the necessary technological advances required to implement new processing strategies. Chief among these has been the better matched processing power of specialty graphics processing units for machine learning. Transcending the classic concept of robots performing repetitive tasks, artificial intelligence and machine learning are related concepts that has proven their abilities to design concepts and solve problems. The implication of such abilities being that future machines may further intrude on the domain of heretofore \"human-reserved\" tasks. Although the potential of artificial intelligence/machine learning is profound, present marketing promises and hype exceeds its stage of development, analogous to the seventieth century mathematical \"boom\" with algebra. Nevertheless robotic systems augmented by machine learning may eventually improve robot-assisted retinal surgery and could potentially transform the discipline. This commentary analyzes advances in retinal robotic surgery, its current drawbacks and limitations, and the potential role of artificial intelligence in robotic retinal surgery.",

    "abstract": "While financial deprivation, social isolation, and low emotional intelligence (EI) have been separately identified as important predictors of mental illness, no research has assessed the contribution of these factors together in understanding early markers of severe psychological distress. This information can have key implications for the development of comprehensive interventions and psychological treatment programmes. This study investigated the shared and unique contribution of financial well-being, social support, and trait EI on different types of psychological distress.\nA total of 309 patients seeking psychological treatment at an outpatient mental health clinic in the United States provided consent to participate in this study. Patients responded to online questionnaires corresponding to symptomatology, demographic characteristics, and psychometric assessments.\nHierarchical linear regressions identified the common and unique role of each set of variables in predicting nine different symptom clusters of psychological distress.\nFinancial well-being, social support, and trait EI were negatively related to the majority of symptom clusters, together explaining between 20% and 53% of the variance. Whereas financial well-being and social support uniquely captured a significant amount of the variance in all outcomes, trait EI, most notably the well-being and self-control dimensions, captured the most.\nThe results highlight the importance of all factors in understanding variations in mental health among help-seeking urban individuals. Furthermore, the results identify well-being and self-control as emotional facets to consider in therapeutic programmes in as much as to mitigate the risk of severe psychological distress within this population.\nTogether, financial well-being, social support, and trait emotional intelligence (EI) can help prevent psychological distress in help-seeking urban individuals. Perceived social support and social contact differentially contributed to improved symptoms of psychological distress. Studies should examine the impact of targeting well-being and self-control in psychological treatment. The correlational nature of this study highlights the need to replicate findings via experimental or longitudinal designs.",

    "abstract": "In the past ten years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in biomedicine has increased rapidly, which roots in the rapid growth of biomedicine data, the improvement of computing performance, and the development of deep learning methods. At present, there are great difficulties in front of AI for solving complex and comprehensive medical problems. Ontology can play an important role in how to make machines have stronger intelligence and has wider applications in the medical field. By using ontologies, (meta) data can be standardized so that data quality is improved and more data analysis methods can be introduced, data integration can be supported by the semantics relationships which are specified in ontologies, and effective logic expression in nature language can be better understood by machine. This can be a pathway to stronger AI. Under this circumstance, the Chinese Conference on Biomedical Ontology and Terminology was held in Beijing in autumn 2019, with the theme \"Making Machine Understand Data\". The success of this conference further improves the development of ontology in the field of biomedical information in China, and will promote the integration of Chinese ontology research and application with the international standards and the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability(FAIR) Data Principle.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that altered asymmetry of the planum temporale (PT) is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including dyslexia, schizophrenia, and autism. Shared genetic factors have been suggested to link PT asymmetry to these disorders. In a dataset of unrelated subjects from the general population (UK Biobank, N\u00a0=\u00a018,057), we found that PT volume asymmetry had a significant heritability of roughly 14%. In genome-wide association analysis, two loci were significantly associated with PT asymmetry, including a coding polymorphism within the gene ITIH5 that is predicted to affect the protein's function and to be deleterious (rs41298373, p\u00a0=\u00a02.01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-15), and a locus that affects the expression of the genes BOK and DTYMK (rs7420166, p\u00a0=\u00a07.54\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-10). DTYMK showed left-right asymmetry of mRNA expression in post mortem PT tissue. Cortex-wide mapping of these SNP effects revealed influences on asymmetry that went somewhat beyond the PT. Using publicly available genome-wide association statistics from large-scale studies, we saw no significant genetic correlations of PT asymmetry with autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, educational attainment or intelligence. Of the top two individual loci associated with PT asymmetry, rs41298373 showed a tentative association with intelligence (unadjusted p\u00a0=\u00a0.025), while the locus at BOK/DTYMK showed tentative association with educational attainment (unadjusted Ps\u00a0<\u00a0.05). These findings provide novel insights into the genetic contributions to human brain asymmetry, but do not support a substantial polygenic association of PT asymmetry with cognitive variation and mental disorders, as far as can be discerned with current sample sizes.",

Using large amounts of aggregated data, the AI can discover and learn further transforming these data into \"usable\" knowledge. Being well aware of this, the world's leading pharmaceutical companies have already begun to use artificial intelligence to improve their research regarding new drugs. The goal is to exploit modern computational biology and machine learning systems to predict the molecular behaviour and the likelihood of getting a useful drug, thus saving time and money on unnecessary tests. Clinical studies, electronic medical records, high-resolution medical images, and genomic profiles can be used as resources to aid drug development. Pharmaceutical and medical researchers have extensive data sets that can be analyzed by strong AI systems. This review focused on how computational biology and artificial intelligence technologies can be implemented by integrating the knowledge of cancer drugs, drug resistance, next-generation sequencing, genetic variants, and structural biology in the cancer precision drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Despite intensive efforts, there are still enormous challenges in provision of healthcare services to the increasing aging population. Recent observations have raised concerns regarding the soaring costs of healthcare, the imbalance of medical resources, inefficient healthcare system administration, and inconvenient medical experiences. However, cutting-edge technologies are being developed to meet these challenges, including, but not limited to, Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence, and 5G wireless transmission technology to improve the patient experience and healthcare service quality, while cutting the total cost attributable to healthcare. This is not an unrealistic fantasy, as these emerging technologies are beginning to impact and reconstruct healthcare in subtle ways. Although the technologies mentioned above are integrated, in this review we take a brief look at cases focusing on the application of 5G wireless transmission technology in healthcare. We also highlight the potential pitfalls to availability of 5G technologies.",

    "abstract": "The wide adoption of electronic health record systems in health care generates big real-world data that open new venues to conduct clinical research. As a large amount of valuable clinical information is locked in clinical narratives, natural language processing techniques as an artificial intelligence approach have been leveraged to extract information from clinical narratives in electronic health records. This capability of natural language processing potentially enables automated chart review for identifying patients with distinctive clinical characteristics in clinical care and reduces methodological heterogeneity in defining phenotype, obscuring biological heterogeneity in research concerning allergy, asthma, and immunology. This brief review discusses the current literature on the secondary use of electronic health record data for clinical research concerning allergy, asthma, and immunology and highlights the potential, challenges, and implications of natural language processing techniques.",

    "abstract": "Primary health care and its strengthening through performance measurement is essential for sustainably working towards universal health coverage. Existing performance frameworks and indicators to measure primary health care capture system functions like governance, financing and resourcing but to a lesser extent the function of services delivery and its heterogeneous nature. Moreover, most frameworks have weak links with routine information systems and national health priorities, especially in the context of high- and middle-income countries. This paper presents the development of a tool that responds to this context with the aim to create primary health care performance intelligence for the 53 countries of the WHO European Region.\nThe work builds-off of an existing systematic review on primary care and draws on priorities of current European health policies and available (inter)national information systems. Its development included: (i) reviewing and classifying features of primary care; (ii) constructing a set of tracer conditions; and (iii) mapping existing indicators in the framework resulting from (i). The analysis was validated through a series of reviews: in-person meetings with country-nominated focal points and primary care experts; at-distance expert reviews; and, preliminary testing with country informants.\nThe resulting framework applies a performance continuum in the classical approach of structures-processes-outcomes spanning 6 domains - primary care structures, model of primary care, care contact, primary care outputs, health system outcomes, and health outcomes - that are further classified by 26 subdomains and 63 features of primary care. A care continuum was developed using a set of 12 tracer conditions. A total of 139 indicators were mapped to the classification, each with an identified data source to safeguard measurability. Individual indicator passports and a glossary of terms were developed to support the standardization of the findings.\nThe resulting framework and suite of indicators, coined the Primary Health Care Impact, Performance and Capacity Tool (PHC-IMPACT), has the potential to be applied in Europe, closing the gap on existing data collection, analysis and use of performance intelligence for decision-making towards primary health care strengthening.",

    "abstract": "Recent lead (Pb) exposure reduction strategies enabled to lower children's blood lead levels (B-Pb) worldwide. This study reports the estimated intelligence gain and social cost savings attributable to recent exposure reduction based on reported B-Pb levels observed in adolescents sampled within the framework of the Flemish Environment and Health Studies (FLEHS, Belgium), i.e. in 2003-2004 (FLEHSI), in 2008-2009 (FLEHSII), and in 2013-2014 (FLEHSIII).\nIntelligence Quotient (IQ) loss per 100,000 individuals - attributable to B-Pb above 20\u2009\u03bcg/L - was estimated based on widely accepted dose response functions between children's B-Pb and IQ (-\u20091.88 IQ points for a duplication in B-Pb from 20\u2009\u03bcg/L onwards; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): -\u20091.16;-2.59) and B-Pb exposure distribution parameters of FLEHS studies. The results were translated to the Flemish population of 15-year-olds. Given a 3-year time gap between subsequent sampling periods, the exposure distribution of each study was assumed 3 years prior to the study as well. Economic impact was estimated based on expected decrease in lifetime earnings (\u20ac 19,464 per decreasing IQ point in 2018).\nThe percentage of the adolescent population exceeding a B-Pb of 20\u2009\u03bcg/L decreased from 57% (FLEHSI) to 23% (FLEHSII), and even further to 2.5% (FLEHSIII). The estimated IQ loss per 100,000 individuals was 94,280 (95% CI: 58,427-130,138) in FLEHSI, 14,993 (95% CI: 9289-20,695) in FLEHSII, and 976 (95% CI: 604-1347) in FLEHSIII. This translates into a total loss of 378,962 (95%CI: 234,840-523,091) IQ points within the Flemish population of 15-year-olds between 2000 and 2014. Assuming that current exposure levels do not reincrease, the expected IQ loss during the subsequent period of 15\u2009years is estimated to be maximally 10,275 (95%CI: 6363-14,182) points.\n7176 (95%CI: 4447-9905) million \u20ac of social cost savings were achieved by Pb reduction strategies in Flanders over 15\u2009years. If current exposure levels further reduce to B-Pb below 20\u2009\u03bcg/L for the whole population, social cost savings may increase up to 7376 (95%CI: 4571-10,181) million \u20ac. Given the relatively low lead contamination in Flanders, the global impact of ongoing reduction strategies is expected to be tremendous.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have demonstrated that individual differences in processing speed fully mediate the association between age and intelligence, whereas the association between processing speed and intelligence cannot be explained by age differences. Because measures of processing speed reflect a plethora of cognitive and motivational processes, it cannot be determined which specific processes give rise to this mediation effect. This makes it hard to decide whether these processes should be conceived of as a cause or an indicator of cognitive aging. In the present study, we addressed this question by using a neurocognitive psychometrics approach to decompose the association between age differences and fluid intelligence. Reanalyzing data from two previously published datasets containing 223 participants between 18 and 61 years, we investigated whether individual differences in diffusion model parameters and in ERP latencies associated with higher-order attentional processing explained the association between age differences and fluid intelligence. We demonstrate that individual differences in the speed of non-decisional processes such as encoding, response preparation, and response execution, and individual differences in latencies of ERP components associated with higher-order cognitive processes explained the negative association between age differences and fluid intelligence. Because both parameters jointly accounted for the association between age differences and fluid intelligence, age-related differences in both parameters may reflect age-related differences in anterior brain regions associated with response planning that are prone to be affected by age-related changes. Conversely, age differences did not account for the association between processing speed and fluid intelligence. Our results suggest that the relationship between age differences and fluid intelligence is multifactorially determined.",

    "abstract": "(1) Background: Recently, it has been shown that the extent of resection (EOR) and molecular classification of low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are endowed with prognostic significance. However, a prognostic stratification of patients able to give specific weight to the single parameters able to predict prognosis is still missing. Here, we adopt classic statistics and an artificial intelligence algorithm to define a multiparametric prognostic stratification of grade II glioma patients. (2) Methods: 241 adults who underwent surgery for a supratentorial LGG were included. Clinical, neuroradiological, surgical, histopathological and molecular data were assessed for their ability to predict overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and malignant progression-free survival (MPFS). Finally, a decision-tree algorithm was employed to stratify patients. (3) Results: Classic statistics confirmed EOR, pre-operative- and post-operative tumor volumes, Ki67, and the molecular classification as independent predictors of OS, PFS, and MPFS. The decision tree approach provided an algorithm capable of identifying prognostic factors and defining both the cut-off levels and the hierarchy to be used in order to delineate specific prognostic classes with high positive predictive value. Key results were the superior role of EOR on that of molecular class, the importance of second surgery, and the role of different prognostic factors within the three molecular classes. (4) Conclusions: This study proposes a stratification of LGG patients based on the different combinations of clinical, molecular, and imaging data, adopting a supervised non-parametric learning method. If validated in independent case studies, the clinical utility of this innovative stratification approach might be proved.",

    "abstract": "Emotions influence patient care decisions and professional relationships. Emotional intelligence has been proven to predict nursing students' success in clinical practice and academic performance. Scarce amount of studies have assessed the emotional intelligence in the nursing student selection context.\nTo assess the emotional intelligence of applicants to undergraduate (bachelor level) nursing education and the factors related to it.\nCross-sectional quantitative study.\nThe data collection took place in four Universities of Applied Sciences in October 2016.\nParticipants were nursing applicants (N\u00a0=\u00a0529) who took part in the entrance exams of the four Universities. Overall, 430 applicants (response rate 81%, 75 males) gave permission to access their results for the study's purposes.\nThe Rankein Scale measure of emotional intelligence was used. All of the nursing applicants undertook the same electronic entrance exam in supervised computer classrooms. Statistical analysis included the use of two independent samples tests to compare differences in emotional intelligence scores and ANCOVA models to investigate whether background variables explained the observed differences.\nIn this study, nursing applicants' level of emotional intelligence was found to be average (on a scale of below average, average, above average). However, total scores ranged between 102 and 160 (of 160). Approximately 4% of the applicants scored below the minimum score (<130) and therefore failed the emotional intelligence test. A statistically significant difference was found between the pass and fail groups in terms of the total score. Significant differences were also found in the three subscores and in the total score of admitted and not admitted applicants.\nNursing applicants enter their studies with differing EI skills. This finding may have a major impact on how nursing students experience emotions during their studies. More research is needed to establish the use of EI in student selection context.",

However, total scores ranged between 102 and 160 (of 160). Approximately 4% of the applicants scored below the minimum score (<130) and therefore failed the emotional intelligence test. A statistically significant difference was found between the pass and fail groups in terms of the total score. Significant differences were also found in the three subscores and in the total score of admitted and not admitted applicants.",

    "abstract": "We critically evaluate the future potential of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and artificial intelligence (AI) in precision medicine. The goal of this work is to show progress in ML in digital health, to exemplify future needs and trends, and to identify any essential prerequisites of AI and ML for precision health.\nHigh-throughput technologies are delivering growing volumes of biomedical data, such as large-scale genome-wide sequencing assays; libraries of medical images; or drug perturbation screens of healthy, developing, and diseased tissue. Multi-omics data in biomedicine is deep and complex, offering an opportunity for data-driven insights and automated disease classification. Learning from these data will open our understanding and definition of healthy baselines and disease signatures. State-of-the-art applications of deep neural networks include digital image recognition, single-cell clustering, and virtual drug screens, demonstrating breadths and power of ML in biomedicine.\nSignificantly, AI and systems biology have embraced big data challenges and may enable novel biotechnology-derived therapies to facilitate the implementation of precision medicine approaches.",

    "abstract": "Despite widespread recognition that coercive methods for intelligence gathering are unethical and counterproductive, there is an absence of empirical evidence for effective alternatives. We compared 2 noncoercive methods-the Modified Cognitive Interview (MCI) and Controlled Cognitive Engagement (CCE)-adapted for intelligence gathering by adding a moral frame to encourage interviewees to consciously consider sharing intelligence. Participants from the general population experienced an unexpected live event where equipment was damaged, and an argument ensued. Prior to interview, participants were incentivized to withhold information about a target individual implicated in the event. CCE yielded more target information more frequently than MCI (67% vs. 36%). Similarly, framing yielded target information more often (65% vs. 39%). The effects of interview and framing appear to be additive rather than interactive. Our results indicate combining noncoercive interview methods with moral framing can enhance intelligence gain.

It includes a clinician-facing action recommendation report that will translate an artificial intelligence algorithm to routine practice and an alert when a positive screening result is found. This report was developed using a user-centered approach via an iterative process with input from multiple physician groups. Such data can be reused and adapted to translate other artificial intelligence algorithms. This article also includes data collection forms we developed for the clinical trial aiming to evaluate the artificial intelligence algorithm.

    "abstract": "Deep learning using convolutional neural networks represents a form of artificial intelligence where computers recognise patterns and make predictions based upon provided datasets. This study aimed to determine if a convolutional neural network could be trained to differentiate the location of the anterior ethmoidal artery as either adhered to the skull base or within a bone 'mesentery' on sinus computed tomography scans.\nCoronal sinus computed tomography scans were reviewed by two otolaryngology residents for anterior ethmoidal artery location and used as data for the Google Inception-V3 convolutional neural network base. The classification layer of Inception-V3 was retrained in Python (programming language software) using a transfer learning method to interpret the computed tomography images.\nA total of 675 images from 388 patients were used to train the convolutional neural network. A further 197 unique images were used to test the algorithm; this yielded a total accuracy of 82.7 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval = 77.7-87.8), kappa statistic of 0.62 and area under the curve of 0.86.\nConvolutional neural networks demonstrate promise in identifying clinically important structures in functional endoscopic sinus surgery, such as anterior ethmoidal artery location on pre-operative sinus computed tomography.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs) are steering a new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) applications at the micro-edge. Examples include wireless sensors, wearables and cybernetic systems that collect data and process them to support real-world decisions and controls. For energy autonomy, these applications are typically powered by energy harvesters. As harvesters and other power sources which provide energy autonomy inevitably have power variations, the circuits need to robustly operate over a dynamic power envelope. In other words, the NN hardware needs to be able to function correctly under unpredictable and variable supply voltages. In this paper, we propose a novel NN design approach using the principle of pulse width modulation (PWM). PWM signals represent information with their duty cycle values which may be made independent of the voltages and frequencies of the carrier signals. We design a PWM-based perceptron which can serve as the fundamental building block for NNs, by using an entirely new method of realizing arithmetic in the PWM domain. We analyse the proposed approach building from a 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093 perceptron circuit to a complex multi-layer NN. Using handwritten character recognition as an exemplar of AI applications, we demonstrate the power elasticity, resilience and efficiency of the proposed NN design in the presence of functional and parametric variations including large voltage variations in the power supply. This article is part of the theme issue 'Harmonizing energy-autonomous computing and intelligence'.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are facilitating the work of modern healthcare organisations to leverage the power of big data in clinical practice. In most cases, AI-based systems improve clinical decision-making using multiple layers of information and pre-specified algorithms. In addition, recent AI technologies like machine learning can learn from existing data and perform predictive operations resulting in a robust performance in clinical settings. Such innovations are likely to serve the healthcare industry by minimising human error, savings costs, and maximising informed decision-making. However, critical challenges may affect the applications of AI in clinical settings, which include the effects on patient-provider communication, safety and efficacy of health services, and humane aspects of caregiving.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we examined a large sample of 231 generally healthy older adults across 4\u00a0years with regard to several brain anatomical measures (volumes of total grey matter volume: GM, normal appearing white matter: NAWM, lateral ventricle: LV, and white matter hypointensities: WMH) and psychometric intelligence (verbal and non-verbal). The dataset comprised four measurement occasions (baseline, 1-, 2-, and 4-year follow-ups). With this longitudinal data set, we evaluated level-level, level-change, and change-change relationships between the anatomical and psychometric measures using latent growth curve models. Our analyses indicate that GM and NAWM decreased significantly over the course of 4\u00a0years with annual percent changes of -\u20090.73% and -\u20090.79%, respectively. WMH and LV volumes increase with annual percent changes of 7.3% and 4%, respectively. Verbal and nonverbal IQ measures remained stable in our sample. In addition, we uncovered evidence for level-level and -change associations between several of the brain anatomical measures. With regard to brain-IQ associations, we observed a positive level-level association for GM and NAWM, indicating that participants with larger brain volumes demonstrate higher IQ measures. No substantial evidence was identified for level- or change-change associations between any of the brain metrics and the IQ measures. Taken together, these results suggest that while healthy older adults demonstrated age-related neuroanatomical decline over a time span of 4\u00a0years, these degenerative changes are not necessarily linked to simultaneous cognitive deterioration.",

    "abstract": "This article brings the results of a research of which main goal was to investigate the use of practical intelligence by an oncology nurse team in an oncological ward, in a hospital in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We assume that, in spite of the suffering inherent to health care work, it can have a creative and potent dimension in the exercise of care, even in the presence of the challenges faced by the precarious working conditions, the growing demand of patients and the demands of productivity. Participant observation, in-depth interviews and group interviews were carried out with a selected nursing staff. We observed two main forms of practical intelligence manifestations. The first is the exercise of speaking and listening. The second, as an exercise in the production of comfort. Such forms of practical intelligence interpenetrate and cannot be captured by numbers, indicators, and methods of performance evaluation. They are invisible to instruments that do not go through the word of the workers. We conclude that it is necessary to create collective spaces in health organizations where managers and workers can express and dialogue on such issues, socially validating this know-how and those workers'experiences.\nEste artigo resulta de uma pesquisa cujo objeto \u00e9 o saber-fazer dos trabalhadores de enfermagem. O objetivo principal foi investigar os usos da intelig\u00eancia pr\u00e1tica, em uma equipe de enfermagem de uma enfermaria oncol\u00f3gica no Rio de Janeiro. Partimos do pressuposto de que, a despeito do sofrimento inerente ao trabalho em sa\u00fade, este pode conter uma dimens\u00e3o criativa e potente no exerc\u00edcio do cuidar, mesmo diante dos desafios colocados pelas prec\u00e1rias condi\u00e7\u00f5es de trabalho, pela demanda crescente de pacientes e pelas exig\u00eancias de produtividade. Foram realizadas observa\u00e7\u00e3o participante, entrevistas em profundidade e entrevistas em grupo com trabalhadores da enfermaria selecionada. Observamos duas principais formas de manifesta\u00e7\u00e3o da intelig\u00eancia pr\u00e1tica. A primeira, como exerc\u00edcio da palavra e da escuta. A segunda, como exerc\u00edcio da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de conforto. Tais formas de intelig\u00eancia pr\u00e1tica se interpenetram e n\u00e3o s\u00e3o pass\u00edveis de captura por n\u00fameros, indicadores e m\u00e9todos de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do desempenho. S\u00e3o invis\u00edveis para instrumentos que n\u00e3o passem pela palavra dos trabalhadores. Conclui-se pela necessidade de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de espa\u00e7os coletivos em que gestores e trabalhadores possam expressar e validar socialmente o saber-fazer e as experi\u00eancias dos trabalhadores.",

    "abstract": "Molecules composed of atoms exhibit properties not inherent to their constituent atoms. Similarly, metamolecules consisting of multiple meta-atoms possess emerging features that the meta-atoms themselves do not possess. Metasurfaces composed of metamolecules with spatially variant building blocks, such as gradient metasurfaces, are drawing substantial attention due to their unconventional controllability of the amplitude, phase, and frequency of light. However, the intricate mechanisms and the large degrees of freedom of the multielement systems impede an effective strategy for the design and optimization of metamolecules. Here, a hybrid artificial-intelligence-based framework consolidating compositional pattern-producing networks and cooperative coevolution to resolve the inverse design of metamolecules in metasurfaces is proposed. The framework breaks the design of the metamolecules into separate designs of meta-atoms, and independently solves the smaller design tasks of the meta-atoms through deep learning and evolutionary algorithms. The proposed framework is leveraged to design metallic metamolecules for arbitrary manipulation of the polarization and wavefront of light. Moreover, the efficacy and reliability of the design strategy are confirmed through experimental validations. This framework reveals a promising candidate approach to expedite the design of large-scale metasurfaces in a labor-saving, systematic manner.",

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis and accurate staging are important to improve the cure rate and prognosis for pancreatic cancer. This study was performed to develop an automatic and accurate imaging processing technique system, allowing this system to read computed tomography (CT) images correctly and make diagnosis of pancreatic cancer faster.\nThe establishment of the artificial intelligence (AI) system for pancreatic cancer diagnosis based on sequential contrast-enhanced CT images were composed of two processes: training and verification. During training process, our study used all 4385 CT images from 238 pancreatic cancer patients in the database as the training data set. Additionally, we used VGG16, which was pre-trained in ImageNet and contained 13 convolutional layers and three fully connected layers, to initialize the feature extraction network. In the verification experiment, we used sequential clinical CT images from 238 pancreatic cancer patients as our experimental data and input these data into the faster region-based convolution network (Faster R-CNN) model that had completed training. Totally, 1699 images from 100 pancreatic cancer patients were included for clinical verification.\nA total of 338 patients with pancreatic cancer were included in the study. The clinical characteristics (sex, age, tumor location, differentiation grade, and tumor-node-metastasis stage) between the two training and verification groups were insignificant. The mean average precision was 0.7664, indicating a good training effect of the Faster R-CNN. Sequential contrast-enhanced CT images of 100 pancreatic cancer patients were used for clinical verification. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve calculated according to the trapezoidal rule was 0.9632. It took approximately 0.2 s for the Faster R-CNN AI to automatically process one CT image, which is much faster than the time required for diagnosis by an imaging specialist.\nFaster R-CNN AI is an effective and objective method with high accuracy for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.\nChiCTR1800017542; http://www.chictr.org.cn.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this investigation was to create an automated cephalometric X\u2011ray analysis using a\u00a0specialized artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. We compared the accuracy of this analysis to the current gold standard (analyses performed by human experts) to evaluate precision and clinical application of such an approach in orthodontic routine.\nFor training of the network, 12\u00a0experienced examiners identified 18\u00a0landmarks on a\u00a0total of 1792\u00a0cephalometric X\u2011rays. To evaluate quality of the predictions of the AI, both AI and each examiner analyzed 12\u00a0commonly used orthodontic parameters on a\u00a0basis of 50\u00a0cephalometric X\u2011rays that were not part of the training data for the AI. Median values of the 12\u00a0examiners for each parameter were defined as humans' gold standard and compared to the AI's predictions.\nThere were almost no statistically significant differences between humans' gold standard and the AI's predictions. Differences between the two analyses do not seem to be clinically relevant.\nWe created an AI algorithm able to analyze unknown cephalometric X\u2011rays at almost the same quality level as experienced human examiners (current gold standard). This study is one of the first to successfully enable implementation of AI into dentistry, in particular orthodontics, satisfying medical requirements.",

    "abstract": "Rising concerns about the short- and long-term detrimental consequences of administration of conventional pharmacopeia are fueling the search for alternative, complementary, personalized, and comprehensive approaches to human healthcare. Qigong, a form of Traditional Chinese Medicine, represents a viable alternative approach. Here, we started with the practical, philosophical, and psychological background of Ki (in Japanese) or Qi (in Chinese) and their relationship to Qigong theory and clinical application. Noting the drawbacks of the current state of Qigong clinic, herein we propose that to manage the unique aspects of the Eastern 'non-linearity' and 'holistic' approach, it needs to be integrated with the Western \"linearity\" \"one-direction\" approach. This is done through developing the concepts of \"Qigong breathing signatures,\" which can define our life breathing patterns associated with diseases using machine learning technology. We predict that this can be achieved by establishing an artificial intelligence (AI)-Medicine training camp of databases, which will integrate Qigong-like breathing patterns with different pathologies unique to individuals. Such an integrated connection will allow the AI-Medicine algorithm to identify breathing patterns and guide medical intervention. This unique view of potentially connecting Eastern Medicine and Western Technology can further add a novel insight to our current understanding of both Western and Eastern medicine, thereby establishing a vitality score index (VSI) that can predict the outcomes of lifestyle behaviors and medical conditions.",

    "abstract": "Processing speed is frequently reduced in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS). Reduced processing speed can also lead to impaired working memory capacity (WMC) in adult MS patients. Less is known about the interplay of cognitive deficits in paediatric MS patients.\nIn the present study, we investigated whether processing speed and WMC are reduced in paediatric MS patients compared with healthy controls and whether reduced processing speed and WMC might explain potential differences in psychometric intelligence between MS patients and healthy controls.\nTwenty-one paediatric MS patients and 21 healthy controls completed a reaction time (RT) task, a working memory task, and Cattell's Culture Fair Test (CFT20-R).\nPatients with MS had slower RT and lower intelligence scores than healthy controls. We could find no significant differences for WMC. An analysis of covariance revealed that group differences in intelligence could be partially explained by processing speed differences.\nThe results indicate that processing speed is a good marker for MS-related impaired efficiency and increased error-proneness of the central nervous system in higher-order cognition as required by Cattell's CFT20-R.",

    "abstract": "The devastating consequences of cyberbullying during adolescence justify the relevance of obtaining empirical evidence on the factors that may cause participation in its distinct roles. The goal of this study was to analyze the predictive capacity of aggressiveness (physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and hostility) and emotional intelligence (attention, understanding, and emotional regulation) with respect to being a victim, aggressor or victim-aggressor of cyberbullying during adolescence. The Screening for Peer Bullying, the Aggressiveness Questionnaire and the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 were administered to a sample of 1102 Spanish secondary education students, aged 12 to 18. In general, results revealed a higher probability of being a victim, aggressor or victim-aggressor as physical aggressiveness and anger increased. On the other hand, results revealed a low probability of being a victim, aggressor or victim-aggressor as emotional understanding and emotional regulation increased. These findings highlight the importance of considering said variables when creating prevention programs to stop or reduce the social and educational issue of cyberbullying during adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is a hot topic in medical imaging. The development of deep learning methods and in particular the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have led to substantial performance gain over the classic machine learning techniques. Multiple usages are currently being evaluated, especially for thoracic imaging, such as such as lung nodule evaluation, tuberculosis or pneumonia detection or quantification of diffuse lung diseases. Chest radiography is a near perfect domain for the development of deep learning algorithms for automatic interpretation, requiring large annotated datasets, in view of the high number of procedures and increasing data availability. Current algorithms are able to detect up to 14 common anomalies, when present as isolated findings. Chest computed tomography is another major field of application for artificial intelligence, especially in the perspective of large scale lung cancer screening. It is important for radiologists to apprehend, contribute actively and lead this new era of radiology powered by artificial intelligence. Such a perspective requires understanding new terms and concepts associated with machine learning. The objective of this paper is to provide useful definitions for understanding the methods used and their possibilities, and report current and future developments for thoracic imaging. Prospective validation of AI tools will be required before reaching routine clinical implementation.",

    "abstract": "If screening participants do not trust computerized decision-making, screening participation may be affected by the introduction of such methods.\nTo survey breast cancer screening participants' attitudes towards potential future uses of computerization.\nA survey was constructed. Women in a breast cancer screening program were invited via the final report letter to participate. Data were collected from February 2018 to March 2019 and 2196 surveys were completed. Questions asked participants to rate propositions using Likert scales. Data analysis was done using \u03c7\nThe mean age of participants was 61 years. Response rate was 1.3%. Of the submitted surveys, 97.5% were complete; 38% of respondents reported a preference for a computer-only examination. The highest level of confidence was given a computer-only reading followed by a physician reading. Participants with\u2009>\u200912 years of education were more likely to prefer a computer-only reading (odds ratio [OR] 1.655, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.168-2.344), had a greater trust in letting a computer determine screening intervals and the need for a supplemental MRI (OR 1.606, 95% CI 1.171-2.202 and OR 1.577, 95% CI 1.107-2.247, respectively). Age was not found to be a significant predictor.\nA high level of trust in computerized decision-making was expressed. Higher age was associated with a lower understanding of technology but did not affect attitudes to computerized decision-making. A lower level of education was associated with a lower trust in computerization. This may be valuable knowledge for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world we live in, and it has the potential to transform struggling healthcare systems with new efficiencies, new therapies, new diagnostics, and new economies. Already, AI is having an impact on healthcare, and new prospects of far greater advances open up daily. This paper sets out how AI can bring new precision to care, with benefits for patients and for society as a whole. But it also sets out the conditions for realizing the potential: key issues are ensuring adequate access to data, an appropriate regulatory environment, action to sustain innovation in research institutes and industry big and small, promotion of take-up of innovation by the healthcare establishment, and resolution of a range of vital legal and ethical questions centred on safeguarding patients and their rights. For Europe to fulfil the conditions for success, it will have to find a new spirit of cooperation that can overcome the handicaps of the continent's fragmented technical and legal landscape. The start the European Union has made shows some ambition, but a clearer strategic vision and firmer plans for implementation will be needed. The European Alliance for Personalised Medicine (EAPM) has listed its own priorities: data, integrating innovation into care, building trust, developing skills and constructing policy frameworks that guarantee infrastructure, equitable access, and legal clarity.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, cases of child-to-parent violence (CPV) have increased significantly, prompting greater scientific interest in clarifying its causes. The aim of this research was to study the relationship between styles of family communication (open, offensive and avoidant), emotional intelligence or EI (attention, repair and perceived emotional clarity) and CPV, taking into account the gender of the aggressors. The participants of the study were 1200 adolescents (46.86% boys) between the ages of 12 and 18 enrolled at secondary schools in the Autonomous Communities of Andalusia and Valencia (M = 13.88, SD = 1.32). A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA, 3 \u00d7 2) was performed with CPV and gender as independent variables and family communication styles and EI as dependent variables. The results showed that the adolescents with low CPV obtained lower scores for offensive and avoidant family communication and higher scores for both positive family communication and emotional repair. The girls scored higher than the boys in both offensive communication and perceived emotional attention. The results highlight the importance of encouraging positive communication, as well as the need to strengthen perceived emotional repair to prevent future cases of CPV.",

    "abstract": "As we enter the era of \"big data,\" an increasing amount of complex health-care data will become available. These data are often redundant, \"noisy,\" and characterized by wide variability. In order to offer a precise and transversal view of a clinical scenario the artificial intelligence (AI) with machine learning (ML) algorithms and Artificial neuron networks (ANNs) process were adopted, with a promising wide diffusion in the near future. The present work aims to provide a comprehensive and critical overview of the current and potential applications of AI and ANNs in urology.\nA non-systematic review of the literature was performed by screening Medline, PubMed, the Cochrane Database, and Embase to detect pertinent studies regarding the application of AI and ANN in Urology.\nThe main application of AI in urology is the field of genitourinary cancers. Focusing on prostate cancer, AI was applied for the prediction of prostate biopsy results. For bladder cancer, the prediction of recurrence-free probability and diagnostic evaluation were analysed with ML algorithms. For kidney and testis cancer, anecdotal experiences were reported for staging and prediction of diseases recurrence. More recently, AI has been applied in non-oncological diseases like stones and functional urology.\nAI technologies are growing their role in health care; but, up to now, their \"real-life\" implementation remains limited. However, in the near future, the potential of AI-driven era could change the clinical practice in Urology, improving overall patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is one of the most complex chronic disorders with high prevalence, mainly due to the ageing population and better treatment of underlying diseases. Prevalence will continue to rise and is estimated to reach 3% of the population in Western countries by 2025. It is the most important cause of hospitalisation in subjects aged 65 years or more, resulting in high costs and major social impact. The current \"one-size-fits-all\" approach in the treatment of HF does not result in best outcome for all patients. These facts are an imminent threat to good quality management of patients with HF. An unorthodox approach from a new vision on care is required. We propose a novel predictive, preventive and personalised medicine approach where patients are truly leading their management, supported by an easily accessible online application that takes advantage of artificial intelligence. This strategy paper describes the needs in HF care, the needed paradigm shift and the elements that are required to achieve this shift. Through the inspiring collaboration of clinical and high-tech partners from North-West Europe combining state of the art HF care, artificial intelligence, serious gaming and patient coaching, a virtual doctor is being created. The results are expected to advance and personalise self-care, where standard care tasks are performed by the patients themselves, in principle without involvement of healthcare professionals, the latter being able to focus on complex conditions. This new vision on care will significantly reduce costs per patient while improving outcomes to enable long-term sustainability of top-level HF care.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is an aggressive disease with a low median survival rate. Ironically, the treatment process is long and very costly due to its high recurrence and mortality rates. Accurate early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of cancer are essential to enhance the patient's survival rate. Developments in statistics and computer engineering over the years have encouraged many scientists to apply computational methods such as multivariate statistical analysis to analyze the prognosis of the disease, and the accuracy of such analyses is significantly higher than that of empirical predictions. Furthermore, as artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning and deep learning, has found popular applications in clinical cancer research in recent years, cancer prediction performance has reached new heights. This article reviews the literature on the application of AI to cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and summarizes its advantages. We explore how AI assists cancer diagnosis and prognosis, specifically with regard to its unprecedented accuracy, which is even higher than that of general statistical applications in oncology. We also demonstrate ways in which these methods are advancing the field. Finally, opportunities and challenges in the clinical implementation of AI are discussed. Hence, this article provides a new perspective on how AI technology can help improve cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and continue improving human health in the future.",

    "abstract": "Medical education must adapt to different health care contexts, including digitalized health care systems and a digital generation of students in a hyper-connected world. The aims of this study are to identify and synthesize the values that medical educators need to implement in the curricula and to introduce representative educational programs.\nAn integrative review was conducted to combine data from various research designs. We searched for articles on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCO ERIC between 2011 and 2017. Key search terms were \"undergraduate medical education,\" \"future,\" \"twenty-first century,\" \"millennium,\" \"curriculum,\" \"teaching,\" \"learning,\" and \"assessment.\" We screened and extracted them according to inclusion and exclusion criteria from titles and abstracts. All authors read the full texts and discussed them to reach a consensus about the themes and subthemes. Data appraisal was performed using a modified Hawker 's evaluation form.\nAmong the 7616 abstracts initially identified, 28 full-text articles were selected to reflect medical education trends and suggest suitable educational programs. The integrative themes and subthemes of future medical education are as follows: 1) a humanistic approach to patient safety that involves encouraging humanistic doctors and facilitating collaboration; 2) early experience and longitudinal integration by early exposure to patient-oriented integration and longitudinal integrated clerkships; 3) going beyond hospitals toward society by responding to changing community needs and showing respect for diversity; and 4) student-driven learning with advanced technology through active learning with individualization, social interaction, and resource accessibility.\nThis review integrated the trends in undergraduate medical education in readiness for the anticipated changes in medical environments. The detailed programs introduced in this study could be useful for medical educators in the development of curricula. Further research is required to integrate the educational trends into graduate and continuing medical education, and to investigate the status or effects of innovative educational programs in each medical school or environment.",

    "abstract": "Trait Emotional Intelligence (EI)-related competencies are in growing demand in educational and vocational settings. The present study assesses the developmental dynamics of trait EI in emerging adulthood by capitalizing on the inclusion of a measure of trait EI in the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) called the Emotional Quotient Inventory: Mini (EQ-i: Mini). A sample of 1064 young adults (50% female) from ages 20-21 to 24-25\u2009years was used to assess 4-year rank-order stability and mean-level change of trait EI, as well as whether the EQ-i: Mini functions equivalently over time (longitudinal measurement invariance). Results revealed full configural, partial metric, and scalar invariance of the construct for this time period. The Stress Management subscale achieved invariance at the residual level. After controlling for partial non-invariance, moderate levels of rank-order stability coefficients were found, suggesting malleability of the construct during emerging adulthood. Consistent with the maturity principle, there was a moderate increase in trait EI (specifically in the Interpersonal and Adaptability subscales). The malleability of trait EI suggests opportunities for enhancing socioemotional competencies in emerging adults, such as through formal and continuing education programing, on-the-job training, and targeted employment interventions.",

    "abstract": "Prognosticating the course of diseases to inform decision-making is a key component of intensive care medicine. For several applications in medicine, new methods from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have already outperformed conventional prediction models. Due to their technical characteristics, these methods will present new ethical challenges to the intensivist.\nIn addition to the standards of data stewardship in medicine, the selection of datasets and algorithms to create AI prognostication models must involve extensive scrutiny to avoid biases and, consequently, injustice against individuals or groups of patients. Assessment of these models for compliance with the ethical principles of beneficence and non-maleficence should also include quantification of predictive uncertainty. Respect for patients' autonomy during decision-making requires transparency of the data processing by AI models to explain the predictions derived from these models. Moreover, a system of continuous oversight can help to maintain public trust in this technology. Based on these considerations as well as recent guidelines, we propose a pathway to an ethical implementation of AI-based prognostication. It includes a checklist for new AI models that deals with medical and technical topics as well as patient- and system-centered issues.\nAI models for prognostication will become valuable tools in intensive care. However, they require technical refinement and a careful implementation according to the standards of medical ethics.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a systematic review of literature to better understand the role of new technologies in the perioperative period; in particular we focus on the administrative and managerial Operating Room (OR) perspective. Studies conducted on adult (\u2265 18\u00a0years) patients between 2015 and February 2019 were deemed eligible. A total of 19 papers were included. Our review suggests that the use of Machine Learning (ML) in the field of OR organization has many potentials. Predictions of the surgical case duration were obtain with a good performance; their use could therefore allow a more precise scheduling, limiting waste of resources. ML is able to support even more complex models, which can coordinate multiple spaces simultaneously, as in the case of the post-anesthesia care unit and operating rooms. Types of Artificial Intelligence could also be used to limit another organizational problem, which has important economic repercussions: cancellation. Random Forest has proven effective in identifing surgeries with high risks of cancellation, allowing to plan preventive measures to reduce the cancellation rate accordingly. In conclusion, although data in literature are still limited, we believe that ML has great potential in the field of OR organization; however, further studies are needed to assess the effective role of these new technologies in the perioperative medicine.",

However, discussion about the impact of such technology on the radiographer role is lacking. This paper discusses the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the radiography profession by assessing current workflow and cross-mapping potential areas of AI automation such as procedure planning, image acquisition and processing. We also highlight the opportunities that AI brings including enhancing patient-facing care, increased cross-modality education and working, increased technological expertise and expansion of radiographer responsibility into AI-supported image reporting and auditing roles.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is a significant public health issue. The ability to predict the risk of developing hypertension could contribute to disease prevention strategies. This study used machine learning techniques to develop and validate a new risk prediction model for new-onset hypertension. In Japan, Industrial Safety and Health Law requires employers to provide annual health checkups to their employees. We used 2005-2016 health checkup data from 18\u00a0258 individuals, at the time of hypertension diagnosis [Year (0)] and in the two previous annual visits [Year (-1) and Year (-2)]. Data were entered into models based on machine learning methods (XGBoost and ensemble) or traditional statistical methods (logistic regression). Data were randomly split into a derivation set (75%, n\u00a0=\u00a013\u00a0694) used for model construction and development, and a validation set (25%, n\u00a0=\u00a04564) used to test performance of the derived models. The best predictor in the XGBoost model was systolic blood pressure during cardio-ankle vascular index measurement at Year (-1). Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve values in the validation cohort were 0.877, 0.881, and 0.859 for the XGBoost, ensemble, and logistic regression models, respectively. We have developed a highly precise prediction model for future hypertension using machine learning methods in a general normotensive population. This could be used to identify at-risk individuals and facilitate earlier non-pharmacological intervention to prevent the future development of hypertension.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed at testing the differences in emotional intelligence ability between women with fibromyalgia (cases) and their age-matched counterparts not with fibromyalgia from the general population (controls) and analysing the association between emotional intelligence ability and widespread pain in women with fibromyalgia. A total of 133 cases and 77 controls participated in this cross-sectional study. Controls performed better than cases on emotion understanding. Higher emotion perception and management were significantly associated with lower widespread pain. Therefore, women with fibromyalgia may experience difficulties in understanding emotional information. In fibromyalgia, higher emotion perception and management abilities are independently related to lower widespread pain.",

    "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of vestibular schwannomas (VSs) from MRI could significantly improve clinical workflow and assist in patient management. Accurate tumor segmentation and volumetric measurements provide the best indicators to detect subtle VS growth, but current techniques are labor intensive and dedicated software is not readily available within the clinical setting. The authors aim to develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI) framework to be embedded in the clinical routine for automatic delineation and volumetry of VS.\nImaging data (contrast-enhanced T1-weighted [ceT1] and high-resolution T2-weighted [hrT2] MR images) from all patients meeting the study's inclusion/exclusion criteria who had a single sporadic VS treated with Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery were used to create a model. The authors developed a novel AI framework based on a 2.5D convolutional neural network (CNN) to exploit the different in-plane and through-plane resolutions encountered in standard clinical imaging protocols. They used a computational attention module to enable the CNN to focus on the small VS target and propose a supervision on the attention map for more accurate segmentation. The manually segmented target tumor volume (also tested for interobserver variability) was used as the ground truth for training and evaluation of the CNN. We quantitatively measured the Dice score, average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and relative volume error (RVE) of the automatic segmentation results in comparison to manual segmentations to assess the model's accuracy.\nImaging data from all eligible patients (n = 243) were randomly split into 3 nonoverlapping groups for training (n = 177), hyperparameter tuning (n = 20), and testing (n = 46). Dice, ASSD, and RVE scores were measured on the testing set for the respective input data types as follows: ceT1 93.43%, 0.203 mm, 6.96%; hrT2 88.25%, 0.416 mm, 9.77%; combined ceT1/hrT2 93.68%, 0.199 mm, 7.03%. Given a margin of 5% for the Dice score, the automated method was shown to achieve statistically equivalent performance in comparison to an annotator using ceT1 images alone (p = 4e-13) and combined ceT1/hrT2 images (p = 7e-18) as inputs.\nThe authors developed a robust AI framework for automatically delineating and calculating VS tumor volume and have achieved excellent results, equivalent to those achieved by an independent human annotator. This promising AI technology has the potential to improve the management of patients with VS and potentially other brain tumors.",

    "abstract": "Fifteen years ago, Frey and Detterman established that the SAT (and later, with Koenig, the ACT) was substantially correlated with measures of general cognitive ability and could be used as a proxy measure for intelligence (Frey and Detterman, 2004; Koenig, Frey, and Detterman, 2008). Since that finding, replicated many times and cited extensively in the literature, myths about the SAT, intelligence, and academic achievement continue to spread in popular domains, online, and in some academic administrators. This paper reviews the available evidence about the relationships among the SAT, intelligence, and academic achievement, dispels common myths about the SAT, and points to promising future directions for research in the prediction of academic achievement.",

    "abstract": "Spiritual intelligence is better defined as a capacity to discover and develop true meaning, deep purpose, and vision in life. The purpose of the present study was to determine the predictive role of demographic variables affecting the overall spiritual intelligence in diabetic adolescents.\nIn 2016, a cross-sectional study was conducted involving 200 adolescents with type 1 diabetes referring to the Iranian Diabetes Association consenting to participate. The inclusion criteria were: age ranging from 15 to 21 years, more than a year since last diagnosed with diabetes, patients' full awareness of their disease, not having other physical-psychological illnesses, and not taking any psychiatric or narcotic drugs. Spiritual intelligence was measured using the Spiritual Intelligence Self Report Inventory questionnaire consisting of 24-questions. The alpha Cronbach's method was applied to validate the questionnaire in terms of content, form, and data with the reliability calculated as 0.903. Demographic data were analyzed using SPSS software version 18.\nOn total, 56% of the participants were female, 17.10 \u00b1 1.85, and the mean duration of diabetes was 5.98% \u00b1 3.79%, 62.5% reported diabetes history among immediate relatives.

    "abstract": "Machine learning and artificial intelligence are mostly important if data analysis by knowledge-based analytical methods is difficult and complex. In such cases, combined analytical and empirical approaches based on AI are also meaningful. The development and validation of several clinical parameters for the Corvis ST are a concrete example of this approach. In this article, the development of three screening parameters is described. It is shown how these developments lead to clinical solutions that can be beneficial for detecting clinical and subclinical keratoconus as well as for glaucoma screening.\nMachine Learning stellt insbesondere dann eine sinnvolle Alternative dar, wenn eine Datenanalyse mit wissensbasierten analytischen Methoden sehr aufwendig und schwierig ist. In solchen F\u00e4llen bietet sich auch eine Kombination aus analytischen Methoden und empirischen Methoden mittels k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz (KI) an. Die Entwicklung verschiedener Auswertefunktionen des Corvis ST ist hierf\u00fcr ein konkretes Beispiel. In diesem Beitrag wird die Entwicklung dreier Screening-Parameter mittels KI beschrieben.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we have described the health care problem (maldistribution of doctors) in India. Later, we have introduced the concept of artificial intelligence and we have described this technology with various examples, how it is rapidly changing the health care scenario across the world. We have also described the various advantages of artificial intelligence technology. At the end of the paper, we have raised some serious concerns regarding complete replacement of human based health care technology with artificial intelligence technology. Lastly, we concluded that we have to use artificial intelligent technology to prevent human sufferings/health care problems with proper caution.",

This research aims to assess the attitudes of Chinese cancer patients toward the clinical use of artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM), and to analyze the possible influencing factors.\nA questionnaire was delivered to 527 participants. Targeted people were Chinese cancer patients who were informed of their cancer diagnosis.\nThe effective response rate was 76.3% (402/527). Most cancer patients trusted AIMs in both stages of diagnosis and treatment, and participants who had heard of AIMs were more likely to trust them in the diagnosis phase. When an AIM's diagnosis diverged from a human doctor' s, ethnic minorities, and those who had received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), had never received chemotherapy, were more likely to choose \"AIM\", and when an AIM's therapeutic advice diverged from a human doctor's, male participants, and those who had received TCM or surgery, were more likely to choose \"AIM\".\nMost Chinese cancer patients believed in the AIM to some extent. Nevertheless, most still thought that oncology physicians were more trustworthy when their opinions diverged. Participants' gender, race, treatment received, and AIM related knowledge might influence their attitudes toward the AIM. Most participants thought AIM would assist oncology physicians in the future, while little really believed that oncology physicians would completely be replaced.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly being applied in drug discovery. While some protagonists point to vast opportunities potentially offered by such tools, others remain sceptical, waiting for a clear impact to be shown in drug discovery projects. The reality is probably somewhere in-between these extremes, yet it is clear that AI is providing new challenges not only for the scientists involved but also for the biopharma industry and its established processes for discovering and developing new medicines. This article presents the views of a diverse group of international experts on the 'grand challenges' in small-molecule drug discovery with AI and the approaches to address them.",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of competency-based training, the current evaluation scheme of surgical skills is evolving to include newer methods of assessment and training. Artificial intelligence through machine learning algorithms can utilize extensive data sets to analyze operator performance. This study aimed to address 3 questions: (1) Can artificial intelligence uncover novel metrics of surgical performance? (2) Can support vector machine algorithms be trained to differentiate \"senior\" and \"junior\" participants who are executing a virtual reality hemilaminectomy? (3) Can other algorithms achieve a good classification performance?\nParticipants from 4 Canadian universities were divided into 2 groups according to their training level (senior and junior) and were asked to perform a virtual reality hemilaminectomy. The position, angle, and force application of the simulated burr and suction instruments, along with tissue volumes that were removed, were recorded at 20-ms intervals. Raw data were manipulated to create metrics to train machine learning algorithms. Five algorithms, including a support vector machine, were trained to predict whether the task was performed by a senior or junior participant. The accuracy of each algorithm was assessed through leave-one-out cross-validation.\nForty-one individuals were enrolled (22 senior and 19 junior participants). Twelve metrics related to safety of the procedure, efficiency, motion of the tools, and coordination were selected. Following cross-validation, the support vector machine achieved a 97.6% accuracy. The other algorithms achieved accuracy of 92.7%, 87.8%, 70.7%, and 65.9%, respectively.\nArtificial intelligence defined novel metrics of surgical performance and outlined training levels in a virtual reality spinal simulation procedure.\nThe significance of these results lies in the potential of artificial intelligence to complement current educational paradigms and better prepare residents for surgical procedures.",

    "abstract": "The ambition of precision medicine is to design and optimize the pathway for diagnosis, therapeutic intervention, and prognosis by using large multidimensional biological datasets that capture individual variability in genes, function and environment. This offers clinicians the opportunity to more carefully tailor early interventions- whether treatment or preventative in nature-to each individual patient. Taking advantage of high performance computer capabilities, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can now achieve reasonable success in predicting risk in certain cancers and cardiovascular disease from available multidimensional clinical and biological data. In contrast, less progress has been made with the neurodevelopmental disorders, which include intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy and broader neurodevelopmental disorders. Much hope is pinned on the opportunity to quantify risk from patterns of genomic variation, including the functional characterization of genes and variants, but this ambition is confounded by phenotypic and etiologic heterogeneity, along with the rare and variable penetrant nature of the underlying risk variants identified so far. Structural and functional brain imaging and neuropsychological and neurophysiological markers may provide further dimensionality, but often require more development to achieve sensitivity for diagnosis. Herein, therefore, lies a precision medicine conundrum: can artificial intelligence offer a breakthrough in predicting risks and prognosis for neurodevelopmental disorders? In this review we will examine these complexities, and consider some of the strategies whereby artificial intelligence may overcome them.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare and life-shortening condition often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Despite increased awareness, the delay to diagnosis remains unchanged. This study explores whether a predictive model based on healthcare resource utilisation can be used to screen large populations to identify patients at high risk of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Hospital Episode Statistics from the National Health Service in England, providing close to full national coverage, were used as a measure of healthcare resource utilisation. Data for patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension from the National Pulmonary Hypertension Service in Sheffield were linked to pre-diagnosis Hospital Episode Statistics records. A non-idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension control cohort was selected from the Hospital Episode Statistics population. Patient history was limited to \u22645 years pre-diagnosis. Information on demographics, timing/frequency of diagnoses, medical specialities visited and procedures undertaken was captured. For modelling, a bagged gradient boosting trees algorithm was used to discriminate between cohorts. Between 2008 and 2016, 709 patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension were identified and compared with a stratified cohort of 2,812,458 patients classified as non-idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension with \u22651 ICD-10 coded diagnosis of relevance to idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. A predictive model was developed and validated using cross-validation. The timing and frequency of the clinical speciality seen, secondary diagnoses and age were key variables driving the algorithm's performance. To identify the 100 patients at highest risk of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, 969 patients would need to be screened with a specificity of 99.99% and sensitivity of 14.10% based on a prevalence of 5.5/million. The positive predictive and negative predictive values were 10.32% and 99.99%, respectively. This study highlights the potential application of artificial intelligence to readily available real-world data to screen for rare diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. This algorithm could provide low-cost screening at a population level, facilitating earlier diagnosis, improved diagnostic rates and patient outcomes. Studies to further validate this approach are warranted.",

    "abstract": "The relationship of cognitive developmental trajectories during the dynamic first years with later life development outcomes remains unclear in low- and middle-income countries. 1388 Children born to women who participated in a randomized trial of antenatal micronutrient supplementation in rural China were prospectively followed. Cognitive development was assessed six times between 3 and 30 months of age using Bayley Scales of Infant Development, and then in mid-childhood (7-9 years) and early adolescence (10-12 years) using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. We identified four distinct infant cognitive development trajectory subgroups using group-based trajectory modeling: (i) consistently above average, (ii) consistently average, (iii) started below average and then improved, and (iv) started below average and then declined. LBW infants (<2500\u2009g) were 10.60 times (95% CI 3.57, 31.49) more likely to be in the trajectory group that started below average and then declined, while each grade increase in maternal education decreased the risk of being in this group by 73% (95% CI 54%, 84%). Infants who performed consistently above average had 8.02 (95% CI 1.46, 14.59) points higher IQ in adolescence versus the declining trajectory group. These findings suggest that interventions to improve early child development trajectories may produce long-term human capital benefits.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to investigate the role of emotional intelligence in both extrinsic and intrinsic career success in early and later career stages. Specifically, we examined the predictive and incremental validity of emotional intelligence in career success after controlling for personality factors in a sample of 271 graduates. When analyzing extrinsic career success, regression analyses revealed that demographic variables, such as gender, age, area of study and career stage, and the variable of proactive personality, were related to salary. When the dependent variable was job satisfaction, emotional intelligence acted as a strong predictor, even when personality traits and proactive personality were controlled. These findings provide preliminary evidence that emotional intelligence is a relevant addition to guide the achievement of career success. Finally, limitations of the results and implications of these findings are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) represents a widely utilized neuropsychological assessment technique for executive function. This meta-analysis examined the discriminant validity of the WCST for the assessment of mental shifting, considered as an essential subcomponent of executive functioning, against traditional psychometric intelligence tests. A systematic search was conducted, resulting in 72 neuropsychological samples for the meta-analysis of relationships between WCST scores and a variety of intelligence quotient (IQ) domains. The study revealed low to medium-sized correlations with IQ domains across all WCST scores that could be investigated. Verbal/crystallized IQ and performance/fluid IQ were indistinguishably associated with WCST scores. To conclude, the WCST assesses cognitive functions that might be partially separable from common conceptualizations of intelligence. More vigorous initiatives to validate putative indicators of executive function against intelligence are required.",

    "abstract": "Health care is evolving and with it the need to reform medical education. As the practice of medicine enters the age of artificial intelligence (AI), the use of data to improve clinical decision making will grow, pushing the need for skillful medicine-machine interaction. As the rate of medical knowledge grows, technologies such as AI are needed to enable health care professionals to effectively use this knowledge to practice medicine. Medical professionals need to be adequately trained in this new technology, its advantages to improve cost, quality, and access to health care, and its shortfalls such as transparency and liability. AI needs to be seamlessly integrated across different aspects of the curriculum. In this paper, we have addressed the state of medical education at present and have recommended a framework on how to evolve the medical education curriculum to include AI.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to impact almost every aspect of health care, from detection to prediction and prevention. The adoption of new technologies in health care, however, lags far behind the emergence of new technologies. Health care professionals and organizations must be prepared to change and evolve to adopt these new technologies. A basic understanding of emerging AI technologies will be essential for all health care professionals. These technologies include expert systems, robotic process automation, natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning. Health care professionals and organizations must build their capacity and capabilities to understand and appropriately adopt these technologies. This understanding starts with basic AI literacy, including data governance principles, basic statistics, data visualization, and the impact on clinical processes. Health care professionals and organizations will need to overcome several challenges and tackle core structural issues, such as access to data and the readiness of algorithms for clinical practice. However, health care professionals have an opportunity to shape the way that AI will be used and the outcomes that will be achieved. There is an urgent and emerging need for education and training so that appropriate technologies can be rapidly adopted, resulting in a healthier world for our patients and our communities.",

Fog probability maps were derived from four artificial intelligence algorithms (Generalized Linear Model, Generalized Additive Model, Generalized Boosted Model, and Generalized Dissimilarity Model). Models accuracy were assessed using Receiver Operating characteristic Curve (ROC). Three social variables were also selected according to their relevance for fog suitability mapping. Finally, Fog-water harvesting Capability Index (FCI) maps were produced by multiplying fog probability by fog suitability maps. The results showed high accuracy in fog probability mapping for the study area, with all models proving capable of identifying areas with high fog concentrations in the south and southeast. For all models, the highest values of importance were obtained for sky view factor and the lowest for slope curvature. Analytic Hierarchy Process results showed the relative importance of social conditioning factors in fog suitability mapping, with the highest weight given to distance to residential area, followed by distance to livestock buildings and distance to road. Based on the fog suitability map, southeast and southern parts of the study area are most suitable for fog water harvesting. The fog spatial distribution maps obtained can increase fog water harvesting efficiency. They also indicate areas for future study with regions where fog is a critical component in the water cycle.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for detection/localisation of acute proximal femoral fractures (APFFs) on hip radiographs.\nThis study had institutional review board approval. Radiographs of 307 patients with APFFs and 310 normal patients were identified. A split ratio of 3/1/1 was used to create training, validation, and test datasets. To test the validity of the proposed model, a 20-fold cross-validation was performed. The anonymised images from the test cohort were shown to two groups of radiologists: musculoskeletal radiologists and diagnostic radiology residents. Each reader was asked to assess if there was a fracture and localise it if one was detected. The area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for the CNN and readers.\nThe mean AUC was 0.9944 with a standard deviation of 0.0036. Mean sensitivity and specificity for fracture detection was 97.1% (81.5/84) and 96.7% (118/122), respectively. There was good concordance with saliency maps for lesion identification, but sensitivity was lower for characterising location (subcapital/transcervical, 84.1%; basicervical/intertrochanteric, 77%; subtrochanteric, 20%). Musculoskeletal radiologists showed a sensitivity and specificity for fracture detection of 100% and 100% respectively, while residents showed 100% and 96.8%, respectively. For fracture localisation, the performance decreased slightly for human readers.\nThe proposed CNN algorithm showed high accuracy for detection of APFFs, but the performance was lower for fracture localisation. Overall performance of the CNN was lower than that of radiologists, especially in localizing fracture location.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a powerful tool in many fields, including drug discovery. Among various AI applications, molecular property prediction can have more significant immediate impact to the drug discovery process since most algorithms and methods use predicted properties to evaluate, select, and generate molecules. Herein, we provide a brief review of the state-of-art molecular property prediction methodologies and discuss examples reported recently. We highlight key techniques that have been applied to molecular property prediction such as learned representation, multi-task learning, transfer learning, and federated learning. We also point out some critical but less discussed issues such as data set quality, benchmark, model performance evaluation, and prediction confidence quantification.",

    "abstract": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a psychological disorder caused by high stress from daily life activities. It causes severe health issues, such as sore muscles, low concentration, fatigue, and sleep deprivation. The less availability of predictive solutions specifically for individuals suffering from GAD can become an imperative reason for health and psychological adversity. The proposed solution aims to monitor health, behavioral and environmental parameters of the individual to predict health adversity caused by GAD. Initially, Weighted-Na\u00efve Bayes (W-NB) classifier is utilized to predict irregular health events by classifying the captured data at the fog layer. The proposed two-phased decision-making process helps to optimize the distribution of required medical services by determining the scale of vulnerability. Furthermore, the utility of the framework is increased by calculating health vulnerability index using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System-Genetic Algorithm (ANFIS-GA) on the cloud. The presented work addresses the concerns in terms of efficient monitoring of anomalies followed by time sensitive two-phased alert generation procedure. To approve the performance of irregular event identification and health severity prediction, the framework has been conveyed in a living room for 30 days in which almost 15 individuals by the age of 68 to 78 years have been continuously monitored. The calculated outcomes represent the monitoring efficiency of the proposed framework over the policies of manual monitoring.",

    "abstract": "The amount of data collected and managed in (bio)medicine is ever-increasing. Thus, there is a need to rapidly and efficiently collect, analyze, and characterize all this information. Artificial intelligence (AI), with an emphasis on deep learning, holds great promise in this area and is already being successfully applied to basic research, diagnosis, drug discovery, and clinical trials. Rare diseases (RDs), which are severely underrepresented in basic and clinical research, can particularly benefit from AI technologies. Of the more than 7000 RDs described worldwide, only 5% have a treatment. The ability of AI technologies to integrate and analyze data from different sources (e.g., multi-omics, patient registries, and so on) can be used to overcome RDs' challenges (e.g., low diagnostic rates, reduced number of patients, geographical dispersion, and so on). Ultimately, RDs' AI-mediated knowledge could significantly boost therapy development. Presently, there are AI approaches being used in RDs and this review aims to collect and summarize these advances. A section dedicated to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), a particular group of orphan RDs that can serve as a potential study model for other common diseases and RDs, has also been included.",

    "abstract": "The quality of bowel preparation is an important factor that can affect the effectiveness of a colonoscopy. Several tools, such as the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) and Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale, have been developed to evaluate bowel preparation. However, understanding the differences between evaluation methods and consistently applying them can be challenging for endoscopists. There are also subjective biases and differences among endoscopists. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a novel, objective, and stable method for the assessment of bowel preparation through artificial intelligence.\nWe used a deep convolutional neural network to develop this novel system. First, we retrospectively collected colonoscopy images to train the system and then compared its performance with endoscopists via a human-machine contest. Then, we applied this model to colonoscopy videos and developed a system named ENDOANGEL to provide bowel preparation scores every 30 seconds and to show the cumulative ratio of frames for each score during the withdrawal phase of the colonoscopy.\nENDOANGEL achieved 93.33% accuracy in the human-machine contest with 120 images, which was better than that of all endoscopists. Moreover, ENDOANGEL achieved 80.00% accuracy among 100 images with bubbles. In 20 colonoscopy videos, accuracy was 89.04%, and ENDOANGEL continuously showed the accumulated percentage of the images for different BBPS scores during the withdrawal phase and prompted us for bowel preparation scores every 30 seconds.\nWe provided a novel and more accurate evaluation method for bowel preparation and developed an objective and stable system-ENDOANGEL-that could be applied reliably and steadily in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "The increase in life expectancy and recent advancements in technology and medical science have changed the way we deliver health services to the aging societies. Evidence suggests that home telemonitoring can significantly decrease the number of readmissions, and continuous monitoring of older adults' daily activities and health-related issues might prevent medical emergencies.\nThe primary objective of this review was to identify advances in assistive technology devices for seniors and aging-in-place technology and to determine the level of evidence for research on remote patient monitoring, smart homes, telecare, and artificially intelligent monitoring systems.\nA literature review was conducted using Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore, ProQuest Central, Scopus, and Science Direct. Publications related to older people's care, independent living, and novel assistive technologies were included in the study.\nA total of 91 publications met the inclusion criteria. In total, four themes emerged from the data: technology acceptance and readiness, novel patient monitoring and smart home technologies, intelligent algorithm and software engineering, and robotics technologies. The results revealed that most studies had poor reference standards without an explicit critical appraisal.\nThe use of ubiquitous in-home monitoring and smart technologies for aged people's care will increase their independence and the health care services available to them as well as improve frail elderly people's health care outcomes. This review identified four different themes that require different conceptual approaches to solution development. Although the engineering teams were focused on prototype and algorithm development, the medical science teams were concentrated on outcome research. We also identified the need to develop custom technology solutions for different aging societies. The convergence of medicine and informatics could lead to the development of new interdisciplinary research models and new assistive products for the care of older adults.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a widely prevalent disorder that can affect cognitive function. The relationship between cognitive function and OSA is known to be affected by an individual's premorbid cognitive ability. Tools to measure premorbid intelligence across OSA disease severity have not been validated. This brief report aims to establish if the National Adult Reading Test (NART) provides a stable estimate of premorbid intelligence across levels of OSA disease severity. We examined if NART scores varied systematically across levels of untreated OSA severity (defined according to the apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]) and mean oxygen saturation in sleep clinic (n\u00a0=\u00a0121) and community samples (n\u00a0=\u00a0398) using regression analysis. Simple linear regression was used to predict NART scores based on the AHI. NART-estimated premorbid IQ scores without demographics did not vary systematically with AHI (F\u00a0<\u00a01; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.01) or mean SpO",

Testing two cohorts, one in 1932 and another in 1947, researchers set out to measure-using the same validated test each time-the intelligence of every Scottish child 11\u2009years of age. The stated impetus for the Surveys was a fear that average Scottish intelligence was declining. But when investigators compared the results of the 1947 Survey with those from 1932 their predictions were completely upended. Instead of average intelligence declining, it had risen, substantially. The author argues that based on a study of the relevant ecosystems in place in Scotland at the time the increase in intelligence resulted from a decline in lead body burden. There is no evidence that the children were tested for lead. The decline is thought to have closely followed a fall in occupational lead use, a heightened awareness of the dangers of lead-solvency, improvements in lead plumbing in working-class homes, and a national campaign to improve the nutrition of women and children. Evidence shows that milk consumption in Scotland increased sharply, especially among children, beginning in the mid-1930s, just prior to and following the birth of the second cohort. This provided a source of calcium in a diet that had shown signs of deficiency. Evidence also suggests that lead contamination, from lead water pipes and industrial sources, was widely prevalent in Scotland in the early part of the twentieth century.",

    "abstract": "The term \"artificial intelligence\" (AI) includes computational algorithms that can perform tasks considered typical of human intelligence, with partial to complete autonomy, to produce new beneficial outputs from specific inputs. The development of AI is largely based on the introduction of artificial neural networks (ANN) that allowed the introduction of the concepts of \"computational learning models,\" machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). AI applications appear promising for radiology scenarios potentially improving lesion detection, segmentation, and interpretation with a recent application also for interventional radiology (IR) practice, including the ability of AI to offer prognostic information to both patients and physicians about interventional oncology procedures. This article integrates evidence-reported literature and experience-based perceptions to assist not only residents and fellows who are training in interventional radiology but also practicing colleagues who are approaching to locoregional mini-invasive treatments.",

    "abstract": "The identification of biomarkers that discriminate individual ageing trajectories is a principal target of ageing research. Some of the most promising predictors of biological ageing have been developed using DNA methylation. One recent candidate, which tracks age-related phenotypes in addition to chronological age, is 'DNAm PhenoAge'. Here, we performed a phenome-wide association analysis of this biomarker in a cohort of older adults to assess its relationship with a comprehensive set of both historical, and contemporaneously-measured, phenotypes. Higher than expected DNAm PhenoAge compared with chronological age, known as epigenetic age acceleration, was found to associate with a number of blood, cognitive, physical fitness and lifestyle variables, and with mortality. Notably, DNAm PhenoAge, assessed at age 70, was associated with cognitive ability at age 11, and with educational attainment. Adjusting for age 11 cognitive ability attenuated the majority of the cross-sectional later-life associations between DNAm PhenoAge and health outcomes. These results highlight the importance of early life factors on healthy older ageing.",

    "abstract": "Diagnostic tests, such as Immunoscore, predict prognosis in patients with colon cancer. However, additional prognostic markers could be detected on pathological slides using artificial intelligence tools.\nWe have developed a software to detect colon tumour, healthy mucosa, stroma and immune cells on CD3 and CD8 stained slides. The lymphocyte density and surface area were quantified automatically in the tumour core (TC) and invasive margin (IM). Using a LASSO algorithm, DGMate (DiGital tuMor pArameTErs), we detected digital parameters within the tumour cells related to patient outcomes.\nWithin the dataset of 1018 patients, we observed that a poorer relapse-free survival (RFS) was associated with high IM stromal area (HR 5.65; 95%\u2009CI 2.34 to 13.67; p<0.0001) and high DGMate (HR 2.72; 95% CI 1.92 to 3.85; p<0.001). Higher CD3+ TC, CD3+ IM and CD8+ TC densities were significantly associated with a longer RFS. Analysis of variance showed that CD3+ TC yielded a similar prognostic value to the classical CD3/CD8 Immunoscore (p=0.44). A combination of the IM stromal area, DGMate and CD3, designated 'DGMuneS', outperformed Immunoscore when used in estimating patients' prognosis (C-index=0.601 vs 0.578, p=0.04) and was independently associated with patient outcomes following Cox multivariate analysis. A predictive nomogram based on DGMuneS and clinical variables identified a group of patients with less than 10% relapse risk and another group with a 50% relapse risk.\nThese findings suggest that artificial intelligence can potentially improve patient care by assisting pathologists in better defining stage III colon cancer patients' prognosis.",

Higher CD3+ TC, CD3+ IM and CD8+ TC densities were significantly associated with a longer RFS. Analysis of variance showed that CD3+ TC yielded a similar prognostic value to the classical CD3/CD8 Immunoscore (p=0.44). A combination of the IM stromal area, DGMate and CD3, designated 'DGMuneS', outperformed Immunoscore when used in estimating patients' prognosis (C-index=0.601 vs 0.578, p=0.04) and was independently associated with patient outcomes following Cox multivariate analysis. A predictive nomogram based on DGMuneS and clinical variables identified a group of patients with less than 10% relapse risk and another group with a 50% relapse risk.",

    "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in patient care can offer significant benefits. However, there is a lack of independent evaluation considering AI in use. The paper argues that consideration should be given to how AI will be incorporated into clinical processes and services. Human factors challenges that are likely to arise at this level include cognitive aspects (automation bias and human performance), handover and communication between clinicians and AI systems, situation awareness and the impact on the interaction with patients. Human factors research should accompany the development of AI from the outset.",

    "abstract": "To prevent chronicity of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) by early treatment, detecting inflammatory signs in an early phase is essential. Since Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the wrist, hand and foot can detect inflammation before it is clinically detectable, this modality may play an important role in achieving very early diagnoses. By collecting large amounts of MRI data from healthy controls and patients with arthralgia suspicious for progression to RA, patterns can be studied that are most specific for early development of RA. Furthermore, MRI can be used as outcome parameter for randomized placebo-controlled trials on early RA treatment, by detecting subtle changes in image intensities originating from natural progression or treatment effects. Very large amounts of MRI data, however, make manual quantification impractical and the coarse scale used in visual scoring systems (i.e. whole values between 0 and 3) limits its sensitivity to detect changes that are likely to be very subtle in such an early phase. In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence and especially 'deep learning' in interpreting medical images have shown that -in specific areas- a computerized analysis can outperform human observers. Therefore, research has been initiated into applying these artificial intelligence techniques to the quantification of early RA from MRI data. In this paper, an overview is given on the background and history of artificial intelligence, with a special focus on recent developments in 'deep learning', and how these techniques could be applied to detect subtle inflammatory changes in MRI data.",

    "abstract": "to investigate emotional intelligence (EI) and its relationship to nursing leadership.\nstrong, effective leadership is core to organisational competency and significantly influences care quality. EI is the ability to understand one's own feelings and to assess and respond to the feelings of others. It is linked to self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and social skills, all of which are vital in leadership roles. However, insufficient research explores EI in nursing leadership from the perspective of nurse leaders.\na qualitative study employed interpretive phenomenological analysis methods, using a purposive sample of band 7 sisters/charge nurses/team managers (n=5) from one Welsh health board. Semistructured interviews were recorded and analysed in four stages.\nfour clusters of themes were identified, each with two to three subthemes. These were: sensing others-the empathetic leader; experiencing the affected sense of self; strategies employed to build the team; and reading the flux of the organisation.\nalthough the nurse leaders were unfamiliar with the concept of EI, their narratives reflected some core values of EI. However, significant barriers around time, pressure and staffing levels impeded their potential to use EI to become more effective leaders. Nurse leaders should harness the power of emotions to influence others to achieve excellent care.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus has increased significantly in recent years. With the development of artificial intelligence applications in healthcare, they are used for diagnosis, therapeutic decision making, and outcome prediction, especially in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to identify the artificial intelligence (AI) applications for type 2 diabetes mellitus care.\nThis is a review conducted in 2018. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase scientific databases, based on a combination of related mesh terms. The article selection process was based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Finally, 31 articles were selected after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Data gathering was done by using a data extraction form. Data were summarized and reported based on the study objectives.\nThe main applications of AI for type 2 diabetes mellitus care were screening and diagnosis in different stages. Among all of the reviewed AI methods, machine learning methods with 71% (n = 22) were the most commonly applied techniques. Many applications were in multi method forms (23%). Among the machine learning algorithms applications, support vector machine (21%) and naive Bayesian (19%) were the most commonly used methods. The most important variables that were used in the selected studies were body mass index, fasting blood sugar, blood pressure, HbA1c, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and demographic variables.\nIt is recommended to select optimal algorithms by testing various techniques. Support vector machine and naive Bayesian might achieve better performance than other applications due to the type of variables and targets in diabetes-related outcomes classification.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the current narrative review was to summarize the available evidence in the literature on artificial intelligence (AI) methods that have been applied during robotic surgery.\nA narrative review of the literature was performed on MEDLINE/Pubmed and Scopus database on the topics of artificial intelligence, autonomous surgery, machine learning, robotic surgery, and surgical navigation, focusing on articles published between January 2015 and June 2019. All available evidences were analyzed and summarized herein after an interactive peer-review process of the panel.\nThe preliminary results of the implementation of AI in clinical setting are encouraging. By providing a readout of the full telemetry and a sophisticated viewing console, robot-assisted surgery can be used to study and refine the application of AI in surgical practice. Machine learning approaches strengthen the feedback regarding surgical skills acquisition, efficiency of the surgical process, surgical guidance and prediction of postoperative outcomes. Tension-sensors on the robotic arms and the integration of augmented reality methods can help enhance the surgical experience and monitor organ movements.\nThe use of AI in robotic surgery is expected to have a significant impact on future surgical training as well as enhance the surgical experience during a procedure. Both aim to realize precision surgery and thus to increase the quality of the surgical care. Implementation of AI in master-slave robotic surgery may allow for the careful, step-by-step consideration of autonomous robotic surgery.",

    "abstract": "Navel orange is a very popular fruit which is rich in nutrition necessary to human health. Nowadays, rapid, nondestructive and pollution-free analysis of internal organic compounds of fruit is an important and promising technology. The purpose of this paper is to present a swarm intelligence optimization method to extract the feature information of visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectra of navel orange for rapid and nondestructive analysis of soluble solid content (SSC) in navel orange. This method was developed on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and named as piecewise particle swarm optimization (PPSO). The experimental results showed that the PPSO algorithm proposed in this paper overcame the disadvantage of PSO's premature convergence. The PLS model based on variables selected by PPSO for nondestructively detecting SSC of navel orange yield promising results, as the standard deviation of prediction (SEP) was 0.427\u00b0Brix while the standard error of laboratory (SEL) was 0.22\u00b0Brix. It indicated that the application of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology combined with PPSO for rapid analysis of soluble solid content in navel orange was feasible.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things has grown quickly in the last few years, with a variety of sensing, processing and storage devices interconnected, resulting in high data traffic. While some sensors such as temperature, or humidity sensors produce a few bits of data periodically, imaging sensors output data in the range of megabytes every second. This raises a complexity for battery operated smart cameras, as they would be required to perform intensive image processing operations on large volumes of data, within energy consumption constraints. By using intelligence partitioning we analyse the effects of different partitioning scenarios for the processing tasks between the smart camera node, the fog computing layer and cloud computing, in the node energy consumption as well as the real time performance of the WVSN (Wireless Vision Sensor Node). The results obtained show that traditional design space exploration approaches are inefficient for WVSN, while intelligence partitioning enhances the energy consumption performance of the smart camera node and meets the timing constraints.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), the computerized capability of doing tasks, which until recently was thought to be the exclusive domain of human intelligence, has demonstrated great strides in the past decade. The abilities to play games, provide piloting for an automobile, and respond to spoken language are remarkable successes. How are the challenges and opportunities of medicine different from these challenges and how can we best apply these data-driven techniques to patient care and outcomes? A New England Journal of Medicine paper published in 1980 suggested that more well-defined \"specialized\" tasks of medical care were more amenable to computer assistance, while the breadth of approach required for defining a problem and narrowing down the problem space was less so, and perhaps, unachievable. On the other hand, one can argue that the modern version of AI, which uses data-driven approaches, will be the most useful in tackling tasks such as outcome prediction that are often difficult for clinicians and patients. The ability today to collect large volumes of data about a single individual (eg, through a wearable device) and the accumulation of large datasets about multiple persons receiving medical care has the potential to apply to the care of individuals. As these techniques of analysis, enumeration, aggregation, and presentation are brought to bear in medicine, the question arises as to their utility and applicability in that domain. Early efforts in decision support were found to be helpful; as the systems proliferated, later experiences have shown difficulties such as alert fatigue and physician burnout becoming more prevalent. Will something similar arise from data-driven predictions? Will empowering patients by equipping them with information gained from data analysis help? Patients, providers, technology, and policymakers each have a role to play in the development and utilization of AI in medicine. Some of the challenges, opportunities, and tradeoffs implicit here are presented as a dialog between a clinician (SJN) and an informatician (QZT).",

    "abstract": "Wetlands are extraordinary ecosystems and important climate regulators that also contribute to reduce natural disaster risk. Unfortunately, wetlands are declining much faster than forests. The safeguarding of the wetlands also needs knowledge of the dynamics that control the water balance of these environments. Therefore, an accurate estimation of evapotranspiration in wetlands is an essential task. When adequate experimental data are available, some algorithms deriving from Artificial Intelligence research represent a promising alternative to the most common estimation techniques. In this study, starting from daily measurements of climatic variables such as net solar radiation, depth to water, wind speed, mean relative humidity, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and mean temperature, using the Random Forest, Additive Regression of Decision Stump, Multilayer Perceptron and k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms, 24 estimation models, different in input variables, have been developed and compared. The data have been provided by USGS. They have been obtained from a measuring site in wetlands of Indian River County, Florida using the eddy-covariance technique. The accuracy of these models based on AI algorithms remains good even if the number of input variables is reduced from 7 to 3. Net solar radiation, mean temperature and mean relative humidity or wind speed measurements allow obtaining a sufficiently accurate estimation model. Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors provide slightly better performance than Additive Regression of Decision Stump and Multilayer Perceptron. The analyzed models show in most cases the lowest accuracy in the range 2-4\u00a0mm/day, while the highest accuracy is obtained in the ranges 0-2\u00a0mm/day and 6-8\u00a0mm/day, with the exception of the models based on the Additive Regression, which show similar levels of accuracy in the different considered sub-intervals.",

    "abstract": "The clinical team attending to a patient upon a diagnosis is faced with two main questions: what treatment, and at what dose? Clinical trials' results provide the basis for guidance and support for official protocols that clinicians use to base their decisions upon. However, individuals rarely demonstrate the reported response from relevant clinical trials, often the average from a group representing a population or subpopulation. The decision complexity increases with combination treatments where drugs administered together can interact with each other, which is often the case. Additionally, the individual's response to the treatment varies over time with the changes in his or her condition, whether via the indication or physiology. In practice, the drug and the dose selection depend greatly on the medical protocol of the healthcare provider and the medical team's experience. As such, the results are inherently varied and often suboptimal. Big data approaches have emerged as an excellent decision-making support tool, but their application is limited by multiple challenges, the main one being the availability of sufficiently big datasets with good quality, representative information. An alternative approach-phenotypic personalized medicine (PPM)-finds an appropriate drug combination (quadratic phenotypic optimization platform [QPOP]) and an appropriate dosing strategy over time (CURATE.AI) based on small data collected exclusively from the treated individual. PPM-based approaches have demonstrated superior results over the current standard of care. The side effects are limited while the desired output is maximized, which directly translates into improving the length and quality of individuals' lives.",

    "abstract": "To delineate image data curation needs and describe a locally designed graphical user interface (GUI) to aid radiologists in image annotation for artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medical imaging.\nGUI components support image analysis toolboxes, picture archiving and communication system integration, third-party applications, processing of scripting languages, and integration of deep learning libraries. For clinical AI applications, GUI components included two-dimensional segmentation and classification; three-dimensional segmentation and quantification; and three-dimensional segmentation, quantification, and classification. To assess radiologist engagement and performance efficiency associated with GUI-related capabilities, image annotation rate (studies per day) and speed (minutes per case) were evaluated in two clinical scenarios of varying complexity: hip fracture detection and coronary atherosclerotic plaque demarcation and stenosis grading.\nFor hip fracture, 1050 radiographs were annotated over 7 days (150 studies per day; median speed: 10 seconds per study [interquartile range, 3-21 seconds per study]). A total of 294 coronary CT angiographic studies with 1843 arteries and branches were annotated for atherosclerotic plaque over 23 days (15.2 studies [80.1 vessels] per day; median speed: 6.08 minutes per study [interquartile range, 2.8-10.6 minutes per study] and 73 seconds per vessel [interquartile range, 20.9-155 seconds per vessel]).\nGUI-component compatibility with common image analysis tools facilitates radiologist engagement in image data curation, including image annotation, supporting AI application development and evolution for medical imaging. When complemented by other GUI elements, a continuous integrated workflow supporting formation of an agile deep neural network life cycle results.Supplemental material is available for this article.\u00a9 RSNA, 2019.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly expanding within the sphere of health care, offering the potential to enhance the efficiency of care delivery, diminish costs, and reduce diagnostic and therapeutic errors. As the field of otolaryngology also explores use of AI technology in patient care, a number of ethical questions warrant attention prior to widespread implementation of AI. This commentary poses many of these ethical questions for consideration by the otolaryngologist specifically, using the 4 pillars of medical ethics-autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice-as a framework and advocating both for the assistive role of AI in health care and for the shared decision-making, empathic approach to patient care.",

    "abstract": "Informed estimates claim that 80% to 99% of alarms set off in hospital units are false or clinically insignificant, representing a cacophony of sounds that do not present a real danger to patients. These false alarms can lead to an alert overload that causes a health care provider to miss important events that could be harmful or even life-threatening. As health care units become more dependent on monitoring devices for patient care purposes, the alarm fatigue issue has to be addressed as a major concern for the health care team as well as to enhance patient safety.\nThe main goal of this paper was to propose a feasible solution for the alarm fatigue problem by using an automatic reasoning mechanism to decide how to notify members of the health care team. The aim was to reduce the number of notifications sent by determining whether or not to group a set of alarms that occur over a short period of time to deliver them together, without compromising patient safety.\nThis paper describes: (1) a model for supporting reasoning algorithms that decide how to notify caregivers to avoid alarm fatigue; (2) an architecture for health systems that support patient monitoring and notification capabilities; and (3) a reasoning algorithm that specifies how to notify caregivers by deciding whether to aggregate a group of alarms to avoid alarm fatigue.\nExperiments were used to demonstrate that providing a reasoning system can reduce the notifications received by the caregivers by up to 99.3% (582/586) of the total alarms generated. Our experiments were evaluated through the use of a dataset comprising patient monitoring data and vital signs recorded during 32 surgical cases where patients underwent anesthesia at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. We present the results of our algorithm by using graphs we generated using the R language, where we show whether the algorithm decided to deliver an alarm immediately or after a delay.\nThe experimental results strongly suggest that this reasoning algorithm is a useful strategy for avoiding alarm fatigue. Although we evaluated our algorithm in an experimental environment, we tried to reproduce the context of a clinical environment by using real-world patient data. Our future work is to reproduce the evaluation study based on more realistic clinical conditions by increasing the number of patients, monitoring parameters, and types of alarm.",

    "abstract": "Exponential growth in computing power, data storage, and sensing technology has led to a world in which we can both capture and analyze incredible amounts of data. The evolution of machine learning has further advanced the ability of computers to develop insights from massive data sets that are beyond the capacity of human analysis. The convergence of computational power, data storage, connectivity, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to health technologies that, to date, have focused on diagnostic areas such as radiology and pathology. The question remains how the digital revolution will translate in the realm of surgery. There are three main areas where the authors believe that AI could impact surgery in the near future: enhancement of training modalities, cognitive enhancement of the surgeon, and procedural automation. While the promise of Big Data, AI, and Automation is high, there have been unanticipated missteps in the use of such technologies that are worth considering as we evaluate how such technologies could/should be adopted in surgical practice. Surgeons must be prepared to adopt smarter training modalities, supervise the learning of machines that can enhance cognitive function, and ultimately oversee autonomous surgery without allowing for a decay in the surgeon's operating skills.",

    "abstract": "One of the stated purposes of this Special Issue is to \"discuss when and why intelligence has disappeared\" in education. In this paper, I argue that intelligence is still heavily involved in public education in the United States due to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Moreover, due to several factors, including high-profile court cases, intelligence tests are legally used in an inconsistent manner in special education decision-making throughout the U.S. These cases illustrate the complex issues surrounding the psychometric properties of intelligence tests, historical conflicts surrounding racial equity, differences in federal versus state policies, and methodological concerns surrounding special education policies are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare professionals and students of medical faculties in Poland increasingly encounter culturally diverse patients. It is necessary to support the development of cultural intelligence in order to improve the medical care provided to patients from different cultural backgrounds. At present there are no standardized tools in Poland that can accurately and reliably assess cultural intelligence, which is defined by Ang et al. as \"an individual's capability to function and manage effectively in culturally diverse settings\". As argued in the present paper, this (cap)ability may be important for providing patient-centred care that is culturally adequate and competent.\nThe aim of the research was to show the multistage process of validation of the Polish version of The Cultural Intelligence Scale by Ang et al. and Van Dyne et. al.\nAcross two studies we examined the psychometric properties of the Cultural Intelligence Scale, including reliability (i.e. internal consistency, test-retest reliability, factor structure) and validity (i.e. theoretical, criteria, convergent). In the first two-session study, 349 participants (98% were healthcare professionals, e.g. nurse, student nurse, medical student; mainly women, 89%) completed the Polish version of the Cultural Intelligence Scale twice with an interval of at least 22 days. In addition, across two study sessions participants completed questionnaires constructed to measure (a) cultural competence, (b) need for cognitive closure, (c) emphatic sensitiveness, (d) emotional intelligence, (e) self-esteem, (f) social desirability, (g) personality, and (h) positive/negative attitudes towards culturally divergent people. Finally, to additionally examine the theoretical validity, 36 professional cross-cultural competence trainers completed the Cultural Intelligence Scale during a one-session study.\nThe Cultural Intelligence Scale has been shown to have satisfactory psychometric properties. It has high reliability (Cronbach's alpha, respectively .94 and .95 in the first and second sessions) and the factor structure seems to approach the postulated one. Theoretical and criterion accuracy are well proven; convergence is less straightforward, but it correlates well with tools that examine variables such as cultural competence, cognitive closure, empathy/emphatic sensitiveness, emotional intelligence, self-esteem, personality, and social desirability. The results suggest that these factors contribute to the development of the cultural intelligence.\nThe Cultural Intelligence Scale can be successfully used in empirical research of cultural intelligence of medical professionals and students of medical majors and their education in Polish conditions.",

    "abstract": "The ability to write DNA code from scratch will allow for the discovery of new and interesting chemistries as well as allowing the rewiring of cell signal pathways. Herein, we have utilized synthetic evolution artificial intelligence (SYN-AI) to intelligently design a set of 14-3-3 docking genes. SYN-AI engineers synthetic genes utilizing a parental gene as an evolution template. Wherein, evolution is fast-forwarded by transforming template gene sequences to DNA secondary and tertiary codes based upon gene hierarchical structural levels. The DNA secondary code allows identification of genomic building blocks across an orthologous sequence space comprising multiple genomes. Where, the DNA tertiary code allows engineering of supersecondary structures. SYN-AI constructed a library of 10 million genes that was reduced to three structurally functional 14-3-3 docking genes by applying natural selection protocols. Synthetic protein identity was verified utilizing Clustal Omega sequence alignments and Phylogeny.fr phylogenetic analysis. Wherein, we were able to confirm the three-dimensional structure utilizing I-TASSER and protein-ligand interactions utilizing COACH and Cofactor. The conservation of allosteric communications was confirmed utilizing elastic and anisotropic network models. Whereby, we utilized elNemo and ANM2.1 to confirm conservation of the 14-3-3 \u03b6 amphipathic groove. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first 14-3-3 docking genes to be written from scratch.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the feasibility of a novel method using artificial intelligence (AI), in which the fibrinogen criterion was determined by the quantitative relation between the distributions of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) and fibrinogen.\nA dataset of 154 deliveries comprising more than 2000\u2009g of blood lost due to hemorrhage, excluding disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), among patients from eight national perinatal centers in Japan from 2011 to 2015 were obtained. The fibrinogen threshold criterion was identified by using the function that best fit the distributions of FDP as determined by AI. FDP production was described by differential equations using a dataset containing fibrinogen levels less than the fibrinogen criterion and solved numerically.\nA fibrinogen level of 237\u2009mg/dL as the threshold criterion was obtained. The FDP threshold criteria were 2.0 and 8.5\u2009mg/dL for no coagulopathy and a failed coagulation system, respectively.\nThe fibrinogen threshold criterion for patients with massive hemorrhage excluding DIC at delivery were obtained by selecting the functions that best fit the distributions of FDP data by using AI.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis is a leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide, and is an epidemic in many developing nations. Countries where the disease is common also tend to have poor access to medical care, including diagnostic tests. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence may help to bridge this gap. In this article, we review the applications of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of tuberculosis using chest radiography, covering simple computer-aided diagnosis systems to more advanced deep learning algorithms. In so doing, we will demonstrate an area where artificial intelligence could make a substantial contribution to global health through improved diagnosis in the future.",

    "abstract": "Human-in-the-loop (HITL) AI may enable an ideal symbiosis of human experts and AI models, harnessing the advantages of both while at the same time overcoming their respective limitations. The purpose of this study was to investigate a novel collective intelligence technology designed to amplify the diagnostic accuracy of networked human groups by forming real-time systems modeled on biological swarms. Using small groups of radiologists, the swarm-based technology was applied to the diagnosis of pneumonia on chest radiographs and compared against human experts alone, as well as two state-of-the-art deep learning AI models. Our work demonstrates that both the swarm-based technology and deep-learning technology achieved superior diagnostic accuracy than the human experts alone. Our work further demonstrates that when used in combination, the swarm-based technology and deep-learning technology outperformed either method alone. The superior diagnostic accuracy of the combined HITL AI solution compared to radiologists and AI alone has broad implications for the surging clinical AI deployment and implementation strategies in future practice.",

    "abstract": "Studies have revealed that there is an independent buffer for holding biological movements (BM) in working memory (WM), and this BM-WM has a unique link to our social ability. However, it remains unknown as to whether the BM-WM also correlates to our cognitive abilities, such as fluid intelligence (Gf). Since BM processing has been considered as a hallmark of social cognition, which distinguishes from canonical cognitive abilities in many ways, it has been hypothesized that only canonical object-WM (e.g., memorizing color patches), but not BM-WM, emerges to have an intimate relation with Gf. We tested this prediction by measuring the relationship between WM capacity of BM and Gf. With two Gf measurements, we consistently found moderate correlations between BM-WM capacity, the score of both Raven's advanced progressive matrix (RAPM), and the Cattell culture fair intelligence test (CCFIT). This result revealed, for the first time, a close relation between WM and Gf with a social stimulus, and challenged the double-dissociation hypothesis for distinct functions of different WM buffers.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have a long history, with increasing presence and potential in society and medicine. Much of the medical literature is highly optimistic about AI and machine learning, but fears also exist that healthcare professionals will be replaced by machines. AI remains mysterious for many practitioners, so this paper aims to unwind both hype and fear related to the technology for genetics professionals. After an historical introduction to AI in understandable and practical terms, we review its limitations. Building upon this foundation, we discuss current AI applications in medicine, including genomics and genetic counseling, offering grounded ideas about the impact and role of AI in genetic counseling and delivery of genetic services. Since AI is already being used in genomics today, now is the time to fundamentally understand what it is, how it is being used, what its limitations are, and how it will continue to be integrated into genetics as we look ahead.",

    "abstract": "The electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, and skin lesion interpretation are a diagnostic process that applies image analysis. Knowledge and sufficient clinical experience are necessary to achieve expertise in these fields. However, recent advances in medical informatics, particularly in deep learning, are challenging this diagnostic process and physicians' performance. Only a fraction of clinical diagnostic support based on artificial intelligence (AI) has been validated in a clinical environment, limiting its use at the patient's bedside. Gradual AI integration into medical practice will require that the physicians remain able to assess the strengths and limitations of these new algorithms.\nLa lecture d\u2019un ECG, l\u2019analyse d\u2019une radiographie du thorax ou l\u2019approche d\u2019une l\u00e9sion dermatologique mettent l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019une image au centre de la d\u00e9marche diagnostique.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems that are able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Advances in AI software and hardware, especially deep learning algorithms and the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power their training, have led to a recent and rapidly increasing interest in medical AI applications. In clinical diagnostics, AI-based computer vision approaches are poised to revolutionize image-based diagnostics, while other AI subtypes have begun to show similar promise in various diagnostic modalities. In some areas, such as clinical genomics, a specific type of AI algorithm known as deep learning is used to process large and complex genomic datasets. In this review, we first summarize the main classes of problems that AI systems are well suited to solve and describe the clinical diagnostic tasks that benefit from these solutions. Next, we focus on emerging methods for specific tasks in clinical genomics, including variant calling, genome annotation and variant classification, and phenotype-to-genotype correspondence. Finally, we end with a discussion on the future potential of AI in individualized medicine applications, especially for risk prediction in common complex diseases, and the challenges, limitations, and biases that must be carefully addressed for the successful deployment of AI in medical applications, particularly those utilizing human genetics and genomics data.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of the Ambient Intelligence (AmI) paradigm and the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and services unveiled new potentials for the domain of domestic living, where the line between \"the computer\" and the (intelligent) environment becomes altogether invisible. Particularly, the residents of a house can use the living room not only as a traditional social and individual space where many activities take place, but also as a smart ecosystem that (a) enhances leisure activities by providing a rich suite of entertainment applications, (b) implements a home control middleware, (c) acts as an intervention host that is able to display appropriate content when the users need help or support, (d) behaves as an intelligent agent that communicates with the users in a natural manner and assists them throughout their daily activities, (e) presents a notification hub that provides personalized alerts according to contextual information, and (f) becomes an intermediary communication center for the family. This paper (i) describes how the \"Intelligent Living Room\" realizes these newly emerged roles, (ii) presents the process that was followed in order to design the living room environment, (iii) introduces the hardware and software facilities that were developed in order to improve quality of life, and (iv) reports the findings of various evaluation experiments conducted to assess the overall User Experience (UX).",

    "abstract": "Authors have been advocating the research ideology that a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system trained using lots of patient data and physiological signals and images based on adroit integration of advanced signal processing and artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning techniques in an automated fashion can assist neurologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, and other medical providers to make better clinical decisions.\nThis paper presents a state-of-the-art review of research on automated diagnosis of 5 neurological disorders in the past 2 decades using AI techniques: epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and ischemic brain stroke using physiological signals and images. Recent research articles on different feature extraction methods, dimensionality reduction techniques, feature selection, and classification techniques are reviewed. Key Message: CAD systems using AI and advanced signal processing techniques can assist clinicians in analyzing and interpreting physiological signals and images more effectively.",

    "abstract": "This study determined possible discrepancies between verbal IQ and performance IQ in 8-year-old very preterm (VPT) and extremely preterm (EPT) children, and examined associations between verbal IQ and performance IQ, and sociodemographic factors, perinatal factors, early cognitive outcomes and also with school achievement scores.\nThis prospective cohort study included 120 eight-year-old VPT/EPT children. Cognitive development was assessed at the ages of 2, 5 and 8\u00a0years. Eight years' school achievement results in arithmetic, reading and spelling were collected. Multiple regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of verbal IQ and performance IQ at the age of 8\u00a0years and to determine associations with school achievement scores.\nMean performance IQ (89.8) was significantly lower than mean verbal IQ (99.4; Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a00.59) at the age of 8\u00a0years. Gestational age (GA), small for GA status, and cognitive scores at the ages of 2 and 5\u00a0years significantly predicted verbal IQ and performance IQ at the age of 8\u00a0years. Performance IQ at age 8\u00a0years was an important predictor for arithmetic scores (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.42).\nPerformance IQ was more strongly affected than verbal IQ in 8-year-old VPT/EPT children and was strongly related to mathematical difficulties.",

    "abstract": "Increasing interest in constituents and dietary supplements has created the need for more efficient use of this information in nutrition-related fields. The present work aims to obtain optimal models to predict the total antioxidant properties of food matrices, using available information on the amount and class of flavonoids present in vegetables. A new dataset using databases that collect the flavonoid content of selected foods has been created. Structural information was obtained using a structural-topological approach called TOPological Sub-Structural Molecular (TOPSMODE). Different artificial intelligence algorithms were applied, including Machine Learning (ML) methods. The study allowed us to demonstrate the effectiveness of the models using structural-topological characteristics of dietary flavonoids. The proposed models can be considered, without overfitting, effective in predicting new values of Oxygen Radical Absorption capacity (ORAC), except in the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm. The best optimal model was obtained by the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The ",

    "abstract": "Image-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed to assist doctors in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer using ultrasound thyroid images. However, the performance of these systems is strongly dependent on the selection of detection and classification methods. Although there are previous researches on this topic, there is still room for enhancement of the classification accuracy of the existing methods. To address this issue, we propose an artificial intelligence-based method for enhancing the performance of the thyroid nodule classification system. Thus, we extract image features from ultrasound thyroid images in two domains: spatial domain based on deep learning, and frequency domain based on Fast Fourier transform (FFT). Using the extracted features, we perform a cascade classifier scheme for classifying the input thyroid images into either benign (negative) or malign (positive) cases. Through expensive experiments using a public dataset, the thyroid digital image database (TDID) dataset, we show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and produces up-to-date classification results for the thyroid nodule classification problem.",

    "abstract": "Protein associations are at the core of biological activity, and the drug-based disruption of dysfunctional associations poses a major challenge to targeted therapy. The problem becomes daunting when the structure and regulated modulation of the complex are unknown. To address the challenge, we leverage an artificial intelligence platform that learns from structural and epistructural data and infers regulation-susceptible regions that also generate interfacial tension between protein and water, thereby promoting protein associations. The input consists of sequence-derived 1D-features. The network is configured with evolutionarily coupled residues and taught to search for phosphorylation-modulated binding epitopes. The discovery platform is benchmarked against a PDB-derived testing set and validated against experimental data on a therapeutic disruptor designed according to the inferred epitope for a large deregulated complex known to be recruited in heart failure. Thus, dysfunctional \"molecular brakes\" of cardiac contractility get released through a therapeutic intervention guided by artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Most frail older persons are living at home, and we face difficulties in achieving seamless monitoring to detect adverse health changes. Even more important, this lack of follow-up could have a negative impact on the living choices made by older individuals and their care partners. People could give up their homes for the more reassuring environment of a medicalized living facility. We have developed a low-cost unobtrusive sensor-based solution to trigger automatic alerts in case of an acute event or subtle changes over time. It could facilitate older adults' follow-up in their own homes, and thus support independent living.\nThe primary objective of this prospective open-label study is to evaluate the relevance of the automatic alerts generated by our artificial intelligence-driven monitoring solution as judged by the recipients: older adults, caregivers, and professional support workers. The secondary objective is to evaluate its ability to detect subtle functional and cognitive decline and major medical events.\nThe primary outcome will be evaluated for each successive 2-month follow-up period to estimate the progression of our learning algorithm performance over time. In total, 25 frail or disabled participants, aged 75 years and above and living alone in their own homes, will be enrolled for a 6-month follow-up period.\nThe first phase with 5 participants for a 4-month feasibility period has been completed and the expected completion date for the second phase of the study (20 participants for 6 months) is July 2020.\nThe originality of our real-life project lies in the choice of the primary outcome and in our user-centered evaluation. We will evaluate the relevance of the alerts and the algorithm performance over time according to the end users. The first-line recipients of the information are the older adults and their care partners rather than health care professionals. Despite the fast pace of electronic health devices development, few studies have addressed the specific everyday needs of older adults and their families.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT03484156; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03484156.\nPRR1-10.2196/14245.",

    "abstract": "Nonadherence among patients with chronic disease continues to be a significant concern, and the use of text message refill reminders has been effective in improving adherence. However, questions remain about how differences in patient characteristics and demographics might influence the likelihood of refill using this channel.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an SMS-based refill reminder solution using conversational artificial intelligence (AI; an automated system that mimics human conversations) with a large Medicare patient population and to explore the association and impact of patient demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, language) and social determinants of health on successful engagement with the solution to improve refill adherence.\nThe study targeted 99,217 patients with chronic disease, median age of 71 years, for medication refill using the mPulse Mobile interactive SMS text messaging solution from December 2016 to February 2019. All patients were partially adherent or nonadherent Medicare Part D members of Kaiser Permanente, Southern California, a large integrated health plan. Patients received SMS reminders in English or Spanish and used simple numeric or text responses to validate their identity, view their medication, and complete a refill request. The refill requests were processed by Kaiser Permanente pharmacists and support staff, and refills were picked up at the pharmacy or mailed to patients. Descriptive statistics and predictive analytics were used to examine the patient population and their refill behavior. Qualitative text analysis was used to evaluate quality of conversational AI.\nOver the course of the study, 273,356 refill reminders requests were sent to 99,217 patients, resulting in 47,552 refill requests (17.40%). This was consistent with earlier pilot study findings. Of those who requested a refill, 54.81% (26,062/47,552) did so within 2 hours of the reminder. There was a strong inverse relationship (r10=-0.93) between social determinants of health and refill requests. Spanish speakers (5149/48,156, 10.69%) had significantly lower refill request rates compared with English speakers (42,389/225,060, 18.83%; X\nMultiple factors impacted refill request rates, including a strong association between social determinants of health and refill rates. The findings suggest that higher refill requests are linked to language, race/ethnicity, age, and social determinants of health, and that English speakers, whites, those younger than 75 years, and those with lower social determinants of health barriers are significantly more likely to request a refill via SMS. A neural network-based predictive model with an accuracy level of 78% was used to identify patients who might benefit from additional outreach to narrow identified gaps based on demographic and socioeconomic factors.",

    "abstract": "Physicians have been performing the art of medicine for hundreds of years, and since the ancient era, patients have turned to physicians for help, advice, and cures. When the fathers of medicine started writing down their experience, knowledge, and observations, treating medical conditions became a structured process, with textbooks and professors sharing their methods over generations. After evidence-based medicine was established as the new form of medical science, the art and science of medicine had to be connected. As a result, by the end of the 20th century, health care had become highly dependent on technology. From electronic medical records, telemedicine, three-dimensional printing, algorithms, and sensors, technology has started to influence medical decisions and the lives of patients. While digital health technologies might be considered a threat to the art of medicine, I argue that advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, will initiate the real era of the art of medicine. Through the use of reinforcement learning, artificial intelligence could become the stethoscope of the 21st century. If we embrace these tools, the real art of medicine will begin now with the era of artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac MRI (CMR) allows non-invasive, non-ionizing assessment of cardiac function and anatomy in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). The utility of CMR as a non-invasive imaging tool for evaluation of CHD have been growing exponentially over the past decade. The algorithms based on artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular, deep learning, have rapidly become a methodology of choice for analyzing CMR. A wide range of applications for AI have been developed to tackle challenges in various aspects of CMR, and significant advances have also been made from image acquisition to image analysis and diagnosis. We include an overview of AI definitions, different architectures, and details on well-known methods. This paper reviews the major deep learning concepts used for analyses of patients with CHD. In the end, we have summarized a list of open challenges and concerns to be considered for future studies.",

    "abstract": "The link between emotional intelligence (EI) and negative emotions, especially anxiety, has been investigated in different educational contexts including second/foreign language (L2) learning contexts. However, the link between EI and positive emotions remains underexplored, despite the growing interest of second language acquisition (SLA) researchers in positive emotions, motivated by the Positive Psychology (PP) movement. Grounded on PP theories, a correlational and experimental investigation was conducted on EI and two typical L2 classroom emotions, namely Foreign Language Enjoyment (FLE) and Foreign Language Anxiety (FLA). For the correlational study, questionnaires were administered to 1,718 English learners from three high schools in China. Statistical results showed medium correlations among students' EI, FLE, and FLA. In the intervention study, a pre-test, treatment and post-test design was adopted. A six-week PP-based EI intervention (\"ARGUER\" training model in class and the \"three activities\" of PP in diary) was conducted in the experiment class of 56 students, while not in the control class of 52 students. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with five students in the experimental class and their English teacher. ANCOVA test results and qualitative findings indicated that the EI intervention was effective in improving EI, boosting more positive classroom emotions and alleviating negative classroom emotions. The findings in both the correlational and intervention studies are discussed in combination with previous studies. We also further address their theoretical and practical implications for L2 education.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the opinion and assessment of radiologists, surgeons and medical students on a number of important topics regarding the future of radiology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), turf battles, teleradiology and 3D-printing.\nAn online questionnaire was created using the SurveyMonkey platform targeting radiologists, students and surgeons throughout the German speaking part of Switzerland. A total of 170 people participated in the survey (59 radiologists, 56 surgeons and 55 students). Statistical analysis was carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison post-hoc tests.\nWhile the majority of participants agreed that AI should be included as a support system in radiology (Likert scale 0-10: Median value 8), surgeons were less supportive than radiologists (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Students saw a potential threat of AI as more likely than radiologists did (p\u2009=\u20090.041). When asked whether they were concerned about \"turf losses\" from radiology to other disciplines, radiologists were much more likely to agree than students (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Of the students that do not intend to specialize in radiology, 26 % stated that AI was one of the reasons. Surgeons advocate the use of teleradiology.\nWith regard to AI, radiologists expect their workflow to become more efficient and tend to support the use of AI, whereas medical students and surgeons tend to be more skeptical towards this technology. Medical students see AI as a potential threat to diagnostic radiologists, while radiologists themselves are rather afraid of turf losses.",

    "abstract": "Growth and development can be determined by cervical vertebrae stages that were defined on the cephalometric radiograph. Artificial intelligence has the ability to perform a variety of activities, such as prediction-classification in many areas of life, by using different algorithms, In this study, we aimed to determine cervical vertebrae stages (CVS) for growth and development periods by the frequently used seven artificial intelligence classifiers, and to compare the performance of these algorithms with each other.\nCephalometric radiographs, that were obtained from 300 individuals aged between 8 and 17\u2009years were included in our study. Nineteen reference points were defined on second, third, and 4th cervical vertebrae, and 20 different linear measurements were taken. Seven algorithms of artificial intelligence that are frequently used in the field of classification were selected and compared. These algorithms are k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB), decision tree (Tree), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (Log.Regr.) algorithms.\nAccording to confusion matrices decision tree, CSV1 (97.1%)-CSV2 (90.5%), SVM: CVS3 (73.2%)-CVS4 (58.5%), and kNN: CVS 5 (60.9%)-CVS 6 (78.7%) were the algorithms with the highest accuracy in determining cervical vertebrae stages. The ANN algorithm was observed to have the second-highest accuracy values (93%, 89.7%, 68.8%, 55.6%, and 78%, respectively) in determining all stages except CVS5 (47.4% third highest accuracy value). According to the average rank of the algorithms in predicting the CSV classes, ANN was the most stable algorithm with its 2.17 average rank.\nIn our experimental study, kNN and Log.Regr. algorithms had the lowest accuracy values. SVM-RF-Tree and NB algorithms had varying accuracy values. ANN could be the preferred method for determining CVS.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, despite the large efforts to improve the understanding of cancer biology and development of treatments. The attempts to improve cancer treatment are limited by the complexity of the local milieu in which cancer cells exist. The tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of a diverse population of tumor cells and stromal cells with immune constituents, microvasculature, extracellular matrix components, and gradients of oxygen, nutrients, and growth factors. The TME is not recapitulated in traditional models used in cancer investigation, limiting the translation of preliminary findings to clinical practice. Advances in 3D cell culture, tissue engineering, and microfluidics have led to the development of \"cancer-on-a-chip\" platforms that expand the ability to model the TME in vitro and allow for high-throughput analysis. The advances in the development of cancer-on-a-chip platforms, implications for drug development, challenges to leveraging this technology for improved cancer treatment, and future integration with artificial intelligence for improved predictive drug screening models are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) machines hold the world's curiosity captive. Futuristic television shows like West World are set in desert lands against pink sunsets where sleek, autonomous AI fulfill every human need, desire, and kink. But I, Robot, a movie where robots turn against the humans they serve, reminds us that AI is precarious. Academicians who study how AI interacts with tort law, such as Jessica Allain, David Vladeck, and Sjur Dyrkoltbotn, claim that the current legal regime is incapable of addressing the liability issues AI present. Both Allain and Vladeck focus their research on whether tort law can accommodate claims against fully autonomous AI machines, while Dyrkoltbotn explores how AI can be leveraged to help plaintiffs identify the genesis of their injuries. The solution this article presents is not exclusively tailored to fully autonomous AI and does not identify how technology can be used in tort claims. It instead demonstrates that the current tort law regime can provide relief to plaintiffs who are injured by AI machines. In particular, this article argues that the manner in which Watson for Oncology is designed presents a new context in which courts should adopt a per se rule of liability that favors plaintiffs who bring damage claims against AI machines by expanding the definition of what it means for a device to be unreasonably dangerous.",

    "abstract": "Neurocritical care combines the complexity of both medical and surgical disease states with the inherent limitations of assessing patients with neurologic injury. Artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered interest in the basic management of these complicated patients as data collection becomes increasingly automated.\nIn this opinion article, we highlight the potential AI has in aiding the clinician in several aspects of neurocritical care, particularly in monitoring and managing intracranial pressure, seizures, hemodynamics, and ventilation. The model-based method and data-driven method are currently the two major AI methods for analyzing critical care data. Both are able to analyze the vast quantities of patient data that are accumulated in the neurocritical care unit. AI has the potential to reduce healthcare costs, minimize delays in patient management, and reduce medical errors. However, these systems are an aid to, not a replacement for, the clinician's judgment.",

    "abstract": "Corneal confocal microscopy is a rapid non-invasive ophthalmic imaging technique that identifies peripheral and central neurodegenerative disease. Quantification of corneal sub-basal nerve plexus morphology, however, requires either time-consuming manual annotation or a less-sensitive automated image analysis approach. We aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence-based, deep learning algorithm for the quantification of nerve fibre properties relevant to the diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy and to compare it with a validated automated analysis program, ACCMetrics.\nOur deep learning algorithm, which employs a convolutional neural network with data augmentation, was developed for the automated quantification of the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus for the diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy. The algorithm was trained using a high-end graphics processor unit on 1698 corneal confocal microscopy images; for external validation, it was further tested on 2137 images. The algorithm was developed to identify total nerve fibre length, branch points, tail points, number and length of nerve segments, and fractal numbers. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to determine the AUC for ACCMetrics and our algorithm for the diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficients for our algorithm were superior to those for ACCMetrics for total corneal nerve fibre length (0.933 vs 0.825), mean length per segment (0.656 vs 0.325), number of branch points (0.891 vs 0.570), number of tail points (0.623 vs 0.257), number of nerve segments (0.878 vs 0.504) and fractals (0.927 vs 0.758). In addition, our proposed algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.83, specificity of 0.87 and sensitivity of 0.68 for the classification of participants without (n = 90) and with (n = 132) neuropathy (defined by the Toronto criteria).\nThese results demonstrated that our deep learning algorithm provides rapid and excellent localisation performance for the quantification of corneal nerve biomarkers. This model has potential for adoption into clinical screening programmes for diabetic neuropathy.\nThe publicly shared cornea nerve dataset (dataset 1) is available at http://bioimlab.dei.unipd.it/Corneal%20Nerve%20Tortuosity%20Data%20Set.htm and http://bioimlab.dei.unipd.it/Corneal%20Nerve%20Data%20Set.htm.",

    "abstract": "The multiple demand network (MDN) is conceptualized as the core processing system for multitasking. Increasing evidence also provides strong support for the involvement of the MDN in fluid intelligence (gF), that is, the ability to solve new problems. However, the underlying neural mechanisms of declining intelligence in old age are poorly explored, particularly whether maintenance of the functional architecture of the MDN can characterize superior intelligence in successful aging. Here, we used eigenvector centrality (EC) to explore the resting-state functional architecture of the MDN in terms of its communication across the entire brain. We found gF to be negatively associated with age and that the MDN EC competitively mediated age-related decline in gF over the aging lifespan, suggesting that excessive cross-talk from the MDN is deleterious for intelligence. Critically, older individuals with comparable MDN EC as younger individuals exhibited superior gF compared with their age-matched counterparts. Taken together, these data provide support for the maintenance of youth-like functional architecture of the MDN and its implication for superior intelligence in successful aging.",

    "abstract": "Medical artificial intelligence (AI) promotes technological revolution and industrial transformation in the medical field, and the medical level of orbital disease will also be improved with the in-depth development of AI diagnosis and treatment. The problems should be solved in the orbital disease AI research at the initial stage include: the complex knowledge system of orbital disease requires cross-disciplinary knowledge to improve the level of diagnosis and treatment; the early diagnosis and treatment of orbital disease is absent, and effective technical methods are needed to crack the screening dilemma; the operation of the disease is difficult, and special mechanical devices are needed to break through the boundaries of surgical technique; the medical team of orbital disease is scarce, and it is necessary to share the medical resources effectively. In order to solve the problems mentioned above, the following research directions of orbital disease AI diagnosis and treatment should be included: the orbital disease AI diagnosis system, the orbital disease AI screening platform, the orbital surgery robot and the orbital disease telemedicine. Through the development of multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment, the in-depth exploration of interdisciplinary basic research, the extensive implementation of clinical research, and the extensive integration of industry and academic communication, the AI diagnosis and treatment of orbital disease is approaching a new era.

    "abstract": "Previous studies of cognitive decline in patients with neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury (NCD-TBI) have often failed to control for baseline factors such as premorbid intelligence. The purpose of the current study was to estimate and compare cognitive function among three groups (controls, complicated mild/moderate TBI, and severe TBI) after controlling for premorbid intelligence.\nSeverity of TBI was classified as complicated mild/moderate or severe based on duration of loss of consciousness and brain neuroimaging results. Premorbid intelligence quotients (IQs) were estimated with the Oklahoma Premorbid Intelligence Estimate. There were no differences in premorbid intelligence between the groups, which were also matched for age and education. Current cognitive function was evaluated with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition.\nComparison of current cognitive function among the three groups indicated significant group differences for all indexes and subtest scores. Processing speed showed the highest effect size. However, only working memory differed significantly between the two NCD-TBI groups.\nThe present findings suggest that mental memory manipulation processes seem to be more sensitive to TBI severity than are perceptual-motor processes. Specifically, both auditory rehearsal/discrimination and mental alertness/manipulation will be most strongly influenced by TBI severity.",

    "abstract": "In the past ten years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in biomedicine has increased rapidly, which roots in the rapid growth of biomedicine data, the improvement of computing performance, and the development of deep learning methods. At present, there are great difficulties in front of AI for solving complex and comprehensive medical problems. Ontology can play an important role in how to make machines have stronger intelligence and has wider applications in the medical field. By using ontologies, (meta) data can be standardized so that data quality is improved and more data analysis methods can be introduced, data integration can be supported by the semantics relationships which are specified in ontologies, and effective logic expression in nature language can be better understood by machine. This can be a pathway to stronger AI. Under this circumstance, the Chinese Conference on Biomedical Ontology and Terminology was held in Beijing in autumn 2019, with the theme \"Making Machine Understand Data\". The success of this conference further improves the development of ontology in the field of biomedical information in China, and will promote the integration of Chinese ontology research and application with the international standards and the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability(FAIR) Data Principle.",

    "abstract": "Vehicular traffic noise is the main source of noise pollution in major cities around the globe. A reliable and accurate method for the estimation of vehicular traffic noise is therefore essential for creating a healthy noise-free environment. In this study, 2 linear (simple average and weighted average) and 2-nonlinear (neural network and neuro-fuzzy) ensemble models were developed by combining the outputs of three Artificial Intelligence (AI) based non-linear models; Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and one Multilinear regression (MLR) model to enhance the performance of the single black box models in predicting vehicular traffic noise of Nicosia city, North Cyprus. In this way, first a nonlinear sensitivity analysis was applied to select the most relevant and dominant input parameters of the traffic data obtained from 12 observation points in the study area. The most dominant parameters in order of their importance were determined to be number of cars, number of van/pickups, number of trucks, average speed and number of buses. Classifying the number of vehicles into five categories before feeding the traffic data into the AI models was observed to improve performance of the single models up to 29% in the verification phase. Out of the four ensembles models developed, the nonlinear ANFIS ensemble was found to be the most robust by improving the performance of ANFIS, FFNN, SVR and MLR models in the verification stage by 11%, 19%, 21% and 31%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Research into the neural underpinning of intelligence has mainly adopted a construct perspective: trying to find structural and functional brain characteristics that would accommodate the psychological concept of g. Few attempts have been made to explain intelligence exclusively based on brain characteristics - the brain perspective. From a methodological viewpoint the brain intelligence relation has been studied by means of correlational and interventional studies. The later providing a causal elucidation of the brain - intelligence relation. The best neuro-anatomical predictor of intelligence is brain volume showing a modest positive correlation with g, explaining between 9 to 16% of variance. The most likely explanation was that larger brains, containing more neurons, have a greater computational power and in that way allow more complex cognitive processing. Correlations with brain surface, thickness, convolution and callosal shape showed less consistent patterns. The development of diffusion tensor imaging has allowed researchers to look also into the microstructure of brain tissue. Consistently observed was a positively correlation between white matter integrity and intelligence, supporting the idea that efficient information transfer between hemispheres and brain areas is crucial for higher intellectual competence. Based on functional studies of the brain intelligence relationship three theories have been put forward: the neural efficiency, the P-FIT and the multi demand (MD) system theory. On the other hand, The Network Neuroscience Theory of g, based on methods from mathematics, physics, and computer science, is an example for the brain perspective on neurobiological underpinning of intelligence. In this framework network flexibility and dynamics provide the foundation for general intelligence. With respect to intervention studies the most promising results have been achieved with noninvasive brain stimulation and behavioral training providing tentative support for findings put forward by the correlational approach. To date the best consensus based on the diversity of results reported would be that g is predominantly determined by lateral prefrontal attentional control of structured sensory episodes in posterior brain areas. The capacity of flexible transitions between these network states represents the essence of intelligence - g.",

Articles published up to August 1, 2019, in the field of AI and ML in cardiovascular medicine are also reviewed and placed in the context of the potential role these approaches will have in clinical practice in the future.\nAI is a broader term referring to the ability of machines to perform intelligent tasks, and ML is a subset of AI that refers to the ability of machines to learn independently and make accurate predictions. An expanding body of literature has been published using ML in cardiovascular health care. Moreover, ML has been applied in the settings of automated imaging interpretation, natural language processing and data extraction from electronic health records, and predictive analytics. Examples include automated interpretation of chest roentgenograms, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and angiography; identification of patients with early heart failure using clinical notes evaluated by ML; and predicting mortality or complications following percutaneous or surgical cardiovascular procedures.\nAlthough there is an expanding body of literature on AI and ML in cardiovascular medicine, the future these fields will have in clinical practice remains to be paved. In particular, there is a promising role in providing automated imaging interpretation, automated data extraction and quality control, and clinical risk prediction, although these techniques require further refinement and evaluation.",

An expanding body of literature has been published using ML in cardiovascular health care. Moreover, ML has been applied in the settings of automated imaging interpretation, natural language processing and data extraction from electronic health records, and predictive analytics. Examples include automated interpretation of chest roentgenograms, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and angiography; identification of patients with early heart failure using clinical notes evaluated by ML; and predicting mortality or complications following percutaneous or surgical cardiovascular procedures.",

    "abstract": "Mental disorders are highly prevalent and often remain untreated. Many limitations of conventional face-to-face psychological interventions could potentially be overcome through Internet-based and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). This chapter introduces core features of IMIs, describes areas of application, presents evidence on the efficacy of IMIs as well as potential effect mechanisms, and delineates how Artificial Intelligence combined with IMIs may improve current practices in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders in adults. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials clearly show that therapist-guided IMIs can be highly effective for a broad range of mental health problems. Whether the effects of unguided IMIs are also clinically relevant, particularly under routine care conditions, is less clear. First studies on IMIs for the prevention of mental disorders have shown promising results. Despite limitations and challenges, IMIs are increasingly implemented into routine care worldwide. IMIs are also well suited for applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which provides ample opportunities to improve the identification and treatment of mental disorders. Together with methodological innovations, these approaches may also deepen our understanding of how psychological interventions work, and why. Ethical and professional restraints as well as potential contraindications of IMIs, however, should also be considered. In sum, IMIs have a high potential for improving the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders across various indications, settings, and populations. Therefore, implementing IMIs into routine care as both adjunct and alternative to face-to-face treatment is highly desirable. Technological advancements may further enhance the variability and flexibility of IMIs, and thus even further increase their impact in people's lives in the future.",

    "abstract": "Scientific findings over the past few decades have shaped our understanding of the underlying neurobiology associated with psychiatric illnesses. However, despite significant advances in research, there is widespread disappointment with the overall pace of progress in detecting and treating psychiatric disorders. Current approaches for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders largely rely on physician-patient questionnaires that are most of the time inaccurate and ineffective in providing a reliable assessment of symptoms. These limitations can, however, be overcome by applying artificial intelligence (AI) to electronic medical database and health records. AI in psychiatry is a general term that implies the use of computerized techniques and algorithms for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of mental illnesses. Although the past few years have witnessed an increase in the use of AI in the medical practice, its role in psychiatry remains a complex and unanswered question. This chapter provides the current state of knowledge of AI's use in the diagnosis, prediction, and treatment of psychiatric disorders, and examines the challenges and limitations of this approach in the medical practise.",

    "abstract": "The patients' view on the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology is still mainly unexplored territory. The aim of this article is to develop and validate a standardized patient questionnaire on the implementation of AI in radiology.\nSix domains derived from a previous qualitative study were used to develop a questionnaire, and cognitive interviews were used as pretest method. One hundred fifty-five patients scheduled for CT, MRI, and/or conventional radiography filled out the questionnaire. To find underlying latent variables, we used exploratory factor analysis with principal axis factoring and oblique promax rotation. Internal consistency of the factors was measured with Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability.\nThe exploratory factor analysis revealed five factors on AI in radiology: (1) distrust and accountability (overall, patients were moderately negative on this subject), (2) procedural knowledge (patients generally indicated the need for their active engagement), (3) personal interaction (overall, patients preferred personal interaction), (4) efficiency (overall, patients were ambiguous on this subject), and (5) being informed (overall, scores on these items were not outspoken within this factor). Internal consistency was good for three factors (1, 2, and 3), and acceptable for two (4 and 5).\nThis study yielded a viable questionnaire to measure acceptance among patients of the implementation of AI in radiology. Additional data collection with confirmatory factor analysis may provide further refinement of the scale.\n\u2022 Although AI systems are increasingly developed, not much is known about patients' views on AI in radiology. \u2022 Since it is important that newly developed questionnaires are adequately tested and validated, we did so for a questionnaire measuring patients' views on AI in radiology, revealing five factors. \u2022 Successful implementation of AI in radiology requires assessment of social factors such as subjective norms towards the technology.",

    "abstract": "Developmental processes in the placenta and the fetal brain are shaped by the similar biological signals. Evidence accumulates that adaptive responses of the placenta may influence central nervous system development. We hypothesize that placental mtDNA content at birth is associated with intelligence in childhood. In addition, we investigate if intra-pair differences in mtDNA content are associated with intra-pair differences in intelligence.\nRelative mtDNA content was measured using qPCR in placental tissue of 375 children of the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. Intelligence was assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) between 8 and 15\u00a0years old. We accounted for sex, gestational age, birth weight, birth year, zygosity and chorionicity, cord insertion, age at measurement, indicators of socioeconomic status, smoking during pregnancy, and urban environment.\nIn multivariable adjusted mixed modelling analysis, each doubling in placental mtDNA content was associated with 2.0 points (95% CI 0.02 to 3.9; p\u2009=\u20090.05) higher total and 2.3 points (95% CI 0.2 to 4.3; p\u2009=\u20090.03) higher performance IQ in childhood. We observed no association between mtDNA content and verbal intelligence. Intra-pair differences in mtDNA content and IQ were significantly (p\u2009=\u20090.01) correlated in monozygotic-monochorionic twin pairs, showing that the twin with the highest mtDNA content was 1.9 times more likely (p\u2009=\u20090.05) to have the highest IQ. This was not observed in dichorionic twin pairs.\nWe provide the first evidence that placental mtDNA content is associated with childhood intelligence. This emphasizes the importance of placental mitochondrial function during in utero life on fetal brain development with long-lasting consequences.",

As a consequence, the scientific and technological progresses in handling information and its further processing and cross-linking for decision support and predictive systems must be accompanied by parallel changes in the global environment, with numerous stakeholders, including citizen and society. What can be seen at the first glance as a barrier and a mechanism slowing down the progression of data science must, however, be considered an important asset.

    "abstract": "Although much effort is focused on improving the technical performance of artificial intelligence, there are compelling reasons to focus more on the implementation of this technology class to solve real-world applications. In this \"last mile\" of implementation lie many complex challenges that may make technically high-performing systems perform poorly. Instead of viewing artificial intelligence development as a linear one of algorithm development through to eventual deployment, there are strong reasons to take a more agile approach, iteratively developing and testing artificial intelligence within the context in which it finally will be used.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technology holds both great promise to transform mental healthcare and potential pitfalls. This article provides an overview of AI and current applications in healthcare, a review of recent original research on AI specific to mental health, and a discussion of how AI can supplement clinical practice while considering its current limitations, areas needing additional research, and ethical implications regarding AI technology.\nWe reviewed 28 studies of AI and mental health that used electronic health records (EHRs), mood rating scales, brain imaging data, novel monitoring systems (e.g., smartphone, video), and social media platforms to predict, classify, or subgroup mental health illnesses including depression, schizophrenia or other psychiatric illnesses, and suicide ideation and attempts. Collectively, these studies revealed high accuracies and provided excellent examples of AI's potential in mental healthcare, but most should be considered early proof-of-concept works demonstrating the potential of using machine learning (ML) algorithms to address mental health questions, and which types of algorithms yield the best performance. As AI techniques continue to be refined and improved, it will be possible to help mental health practitioners re-define mental illnesses more objectively than currently done in the DSM-5, identify these illnesses at an earlier or prodromal stage when interventions may be more effective, and personalize treatments based on an individual's unique characteristics. However, caution is necessary in order to avoid over-interpreting preliminary results, and more work is required to bridge the gap between AI in mental health research and clinical care.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid hormones (THs) are critical for brain development. Whether low-moderate fluoride exposure affects thyroid function and what the impact is on children's intelligence remain elusive.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study to examine the associations between low-moderate fluoride exposure and thyroid function in relation to children's intelligence.\nWe recruited 571 resident children, aged 7-13\u202fyears, randomly from endemic and non-endemic fluorosis areas in Tianjin, China. We measured fluoride concentrations in drinking water and urine using the national standardized ion selective electrode method. Thyroid function was evaluated through the measurements of basal THs [(total triiodothyronine (TT\nIn adjusted models, every 1\u202fmg/L increment of water fluoride was associated with 0.13 uIU/mL increase in TSH. Every 1\u202fmg/L increment of urinary fluoride was associated with 0.09 ug/dL decrease in TT\nOur study suggests low-moderate fluoride exposure is associated with alterations in childhood thyroid function that may modify the association between fluoride and intelligence.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the feasibility of training an artificial intelligence (AI) on a public-available AI platform to diagnose polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) using indocyanine green angiography (ICGA).\nTwo methods using AI models were trained by a data set including 430 ICGA images of normal, neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD), and PCV eyes on a public-available AI platform. The one-step method distinguished normal, nvAMD, and PCV images simultaneously. The two-step method identifies normal and abnormal ICGA images at the first step and diagnoses PCV from the abnormal ICGA images at the second step. The method with higher performance was used to compare with retinal specialists and ophthalmologic residents on the performance of diagnosing PCV.\nThe two-step method had better performance, in which the precision was 0.911 and the recall was 0.911 at the first step, and the precision was 0.783, and the recall was 0.783 at the second step. For the test data set, the two-step method distinguished normal and abnormal images with an accuracy of 1 and diagnosed PCV with an accuracy of 0.83, which was comparable to retinal specialists and superior to ophthalmologic residents.\nIn this evaluation of ICGA images from normal, nvAMD, and PCV eyes, the models trained on a public-available AI platform had comparable performance to retinal specialists for diagnosing PCV. The utility of public-available AI platform might help everyone including ophthalmologists who had no AI-related resources, especially those in less developed areas, for future studies.",

    "abstract": "We present an automated method for measuring the sagittal vertical axis (SVA) from lateral radiography of whole spine using a convolutional neural network for keypoint detection (ResUNet) with our improved localization method. The algorithm is robust to various clinical conditions, such as degenerative changes or deformities. The ResUNet was trained and evaluated on 990 standing lateral radiographs taken at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou and performs SVA measurement with median absolute error of 1.183 \u00b1 0.166 mm. The 5-mm detection rate of the C7 body and the sacrum are 91% and 87%, respectively. The SVA calculation takes approximately 0.2 s per image. The intra-class correlation coefficient of the SVA estimates between the algorithm and physicians of different years of experience ranges from 0.946 to 0.993, indicating an excellent consistency. The superior performance of the proposed method and its high consistency with physicians proved its usefulness for automatic measurement of SVA in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies develop rapidly and have myriad applications in medicine and health care. However, there is a lack of comprehensive reporting on the productivity, workflow, topics, and research landscape of AI in this field.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the global development of scientific publications and constructed interdisciplinary research topics on the theory and practice of AI in medicine from 1977 to 2018.\nWe obtained bibliographic data and abstract contents of publications published between 1977 and 2018 from the Web of Science database. A total of 27,451 eligible articles were analyzed. Research topics were classified by latent Dirichlet allocation, and principal component analysis was used to identify the construct of the research landscape.\nThe applications of AI have mainly impacted clinical settings (enhanced prognosis and diagnosis, robot-assisted surgery, and rehabilitation), data science and precision medicine (collecting individual data for precision medicine), and policy making (raising ethical and legal issues, especially regarding privacy and confidentiality of data). However, AI applications have not been commonly used in resource-poor settings due to the limit in infrastructure and human resources.\nThe application of AI in medicine has grown rapidly and focuses on three leading platforms: clinical practices, clinical material, and policies. AI might be one of the methods to narrow down the inequality in health care and medicine between developing and developed countries. Technology transfer and support from developed countries are essential measures for the advancement of AI application in health care in developing countries.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to assess the attitudes and learner needs of radiology residents and faculty radiologists regarding artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in radiology.\nA web-based questionnaire, designed using SurveyMonkey, was sent out to residents and faculty radiologists in all three radiology residency programmes in Singapore. The questionnaire comprised four sections and aimed to evaluate respondents' current experience, attempts at self-learning, perceptions of career prospects and expectations of an AI/ML curriculum in their residency programme. Respondents' anonymity was ensured.\nA total of 125 respondents (86 male, 39 female; 70 residents, 55 faculty radiologists) completed the questionnaire. The majority agreed that AI/ML will drastically change radiology practice (88.8%) and makes radiology more exciting (76.0%), and most would still choose to specialise in radiology if given a choice (80.0%). 64.8% viewed themselves as novices in their understanding of AI/ML, 76.0% planned to further advance their AI/ML knowledge and 67.2% were keen to get involved in an AI/ML research project. An overwhelming majority (84.8%) believed that AI/ML knowledge should be taught during residency, and most opined that this was as important as imaging physics and clinical skills/knowledge curricula (80.0% and 72.8%, respectively). More than half thought that their residency programme had not adequately implemented AI/ML teaching (59.2%). In subgroup analyses, male and tech-savvy respondents were more involved in AI/ML activities, leading to better technical understanding.\nA growing optimism towards radiology undergoing technological transformation and AI/ML implementation has led to a strong demand for an AI/ML curriculum in residency education.",

    "results": "A total of 125 respondents (86 male, 39 female; 70 residents, 55 faculty radiologists) completed the questionnaire. The majority agreed that AI/ML will drastically change radiology practice (88.8%) and makes radiology more exciting (76.0%), and most would still choose to specialise in radiology if given a choice (80.0%). 64.8% viewed themselves as novices in their understanding of AI/ML, 76.0% planned to further advance their AI/ML knowledge and 67.2% were keen to get involved in an AI/ML research project. An overwhelming majority (84.8%) believed that AI/ML knowledge should be taught during residency, and most opined that this was as important as imaging physics and clinical skills/knowledge curricula (80.0% and 72.8%, respectively). More than half thought that their residency programme had not adequately implemented AI/ML teaching (59.2%). In subgroup analyses, male and tech-savvy respondents were more involved in AI/ML activities, leading to better technical understanding.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) interests medical schools as a predictive factor in their graduates' clinical success. Historically black college and university (HBCU) academic health centers produce professionals to address health disparities. This preliminary study evaluated a health disparity reduction curriculum's effect on EI.\nThirty-one undergraduates participating in a Meharry Medical College health disparity reduction program voluntarily self-reported demographic and EI data before and after service-learning training.\nPaired sample t-test results demonstrated significant improvement in EI subscales of total score (p = .004), self-awareness (p=.001), self-confidence (p=.007), self-control (p=.041), motivation (p=.020), and social competence (p=.036). Multiple linear analyses confirmed African American race significantly predicted EI-Motivation (F [1,29] = 5.858, p =.022).\nThese preliminary data support a beneficial effect in African Americans of a health disparity curriculum to improve EI, particularly the relevance of race to motivation. Future research should examine EI in HBCU medical school students.",

    "abstract": "The cerebral cortex contains a significant quantity of intracortical myelin, but the genetics of cortical myelination (CM) in humans is not well understood. Relatively novel MRI-derived measures now enable the investigation of cortical myelination in large samples. In this study, we use a genetically-informative neuroimaging sample of 1096 young adult subjects from the Human Connectome Project in order to investigate genetic and environmental variation in CM and its relationships with cerebral surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT). We found that genetic factors account for approximately 50% of the observed individual differences in mean cortical myelin, 75% of the variation in total SA, and 85% of the variance in global mean CT. Although significant genetic influences were found throughout the cortex, both CM and SA demonstrated a posterior predominance, with disproportionately strong effects in the parietal and occipital lobes and significantly overlapping heritability maps (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Yet despite showing similar spatial heritability patterns, we found evidence that CM is genetically independent from SA at both global and vertex levels; genetically-mediated relationships between CM and CT were similarly small in magnitude. We also found small but statistically significant genetic associations between NIH Toolbox Total Cognition score and CM in the temporal lobe and insula. SA-cognition and CT-cognition correlations were less widespread compared to CM and both patterns were similar to those reported in prior studies.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer care is a leading area for development of artificial intelligence (AI), with applications including screening and diagnosis, risk calculation, prognostication and clinical decision-support, management planning, and precision medicine. We review the ethical, legal and social implications of these developments. We consider the values encoded in algorithms, the need to evaluate outcomes, and issues of bias and transferability, data ownership, confidentiality and consent, and legal, moral and professional responsibility. We consider potential effects for patients, including on trust in healthcare, and provide some social science explanations for the apparent rush to implement AI solutions. We conclude by anticipating future directions for AI in breast cancer care. Stakeholders in healthcare AI should acknowledge that their enterprise is an ethical, legal and social challenge, not just a technical challenge. Taking these challenges seriously will require broad engagement, imposition of conditions on implementation, and pre-emptive systems of oversight to ensure that development does not run ahead of evaluation and deliberation. Once artificial intelligence becomes institutionalised, it may be difficult to reverse: a proactive role for government, regulators and professional groups will help ensure introduction in robust research contexts, and the development of a sound evidence base regarding real-world effectiveness. Detailed public discussion is required to consider what kind of AI is acceptable rather than simply accepting what is offered, thus optimising outcomes for health systems, professionals, society and those receiving care.",

    "abstract": "We report the results of a survey conducted among ESR members in November and December 2018, asking for expectations about artificial intelligence (AI) in 5-10 years. Of 24,000 ESR members contacted, 675 (2.8%) completed the survey, 454 males (67%), 555 (82%) working at academic/public hospitals. AI impact was mostly expected (\u2265 30% of responders) on breast, oncologic, thoracic, and neuro imaging, mainly involving mammography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance. Responders foresee AI impact on: job opportunities (375/675, 56%), 218/375 (58%) expecting increase, 157/375 (42%) reduction; reporting workload (504/675, 75%), 256/504 (51%) expecting reduction, 248/504 (49%) increase; radiologist's profile, becoming more clinical (364/675, 54%) and more subspecialised (283/675, 42%). For 374/675 responders (55%) AI-only reports would be not accepted by patients, for 79/675 (12%) accepted, for 222/675 (33%) it is too early to answer. For 275/675 responders (41%) AI will make the radiologist-patient relation more interactive, for 140/675 (21%) more impersonal, for 259/675 (38%) unchanged. If AI allows time saving, radiologists should interact more with clinicians (437/675, 65%) and/or patients (322/675, 48%). For all responders, involvement in AI-projects is welcome, with different roles: supervision (434/675, 64%), task definition (359/675, 53%), image labelling (197/675, 29%). Of 675 responders, 321 (48%) do not currently use AI, 138 (20%) use AI, 205 (30%) are planning to do it. According to 277/675 responders (41%), radiologists will take responsibility for AI outcome, while 277/675 (41%) suggest shared responsibility with other professionals. To summarise, responders showed a general favourable attitude towards AI.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence permits cerebral processes to be analyzed like computing processes. We can recognize two disturbing lines we can call: The Robot Project, android when is anthropomorphic, and The Cyborg Project. Robots are destined to perform repetitive, risky or accurate tasks in which they can surpass human limitations. No ethical conflicts are perceived here but there are new challenges to be faced as far as the social organization is concerned. As regards androids, apart from their robotic capabilities, their effect on the human being during interaction should be considered, as the impact of mimic's android on the emotion. The cyborgs are creatures composed by biological and cybernetic elements whose goal is to improve the capabilities of their biological parts. There has been no evidence of conflict in their use for rehabilitation or to supply impaired or non-existing functions. It would be different if they were used for manipulative activities. Another application of the cyborg project to consider is the term \"enhancement\", used to describe the increase of neurocognitive or sensory faculties through transcranial/intracranial stimulation. The ethical conflict here lies in the fact that the focus is not so much on healing but on seeking perfectibility or new modalities of perception. Health professionals must act in a new and constantly changing environment that transcends neurosciences and public health. Progress never stops; so, society have to be informed, anticipate dilemmas, and make room for reflection to help decision-making processes that involve individuals as well as the whole human species.\nLa inteligencia artificial permite que los procesos cerebrales sean analizados como procesos computacionales. Presenta dos l\u00edneas inquietantes: el Proyecto Robot, llamado androide cuando es antropom\u00f3rfico, y el Proyecto Cyborg. Los robots est\u00e1n destinados a tareas repetitivas, riesgosas o de precisi\u00f3n, en las que pueden superar las limitaciones humanas, no percibi\u00e9ndose conflictos \u00e9ticos aunque s\u00ed nuevos desaf\u00edos en la organizaci\u00f3n social. Respecto de los androides, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de sus capacidades, habr\u00e1 que considerar los efectos que puedan ocurrir en el ser humano durante la interacci\u00f3n con la m\u00e1quina, como el impacto de la m\u00edmica androide sobre la emoci\u00f3n y estado de \u00e1nimo. Los cyborgs son criaturas compuestas por elementos org\u00e1nicos y cibern\u00e9ticos cuya finalidad es emular o mejorar las capacidades de la parte org\u00e1nica. No se reconoce conflicto en su empleo para rehabilitaci\u00f3n o para suplir funciones alteradas o ausentes; aspectos negativos ser\u00edan su uso para la manipulaci\u00f3n. Otra aplicaci\u00f3n del proyecto cyborg a considerar es el enhancement, t\u00e9rmino utilizado en la literatura anglosajona para definir el aumento de facultades neurocognitivas o sensoriales mediante la estimulaci\u00f3n transcraneal o intracraneal. El conflicto neuro\u00e9tico surge porque el objetivo no es curar sino la perfectibilidad, o nuevas modalidades de percepci\u00f3n. Los profesionales de la salud deben actuar en un entorno nuevo y cambiante que trasciende las neurociencias y la salud p\u00fablica. El progreso contin\u00faa; por lo que se debe informar a la sociedad, anticipar dilemas, y ofrecer espacios de reflexi\u00f3n para la toma de decisiones individuales y para la especie humana.",

    "abstract": "Using a \"theory of mind\" allows us to explain and predict others' behavior in terms of their mental states, yet individual differences in the accuracy of mental state inferences are not well understood. We hypothesized that the accuracy of mental state inferences can be explained by the ability to characterize the mind giving rise to the mental state. Under this proposal, individuals differentiate between minds by representing them in \"Mind-space\"-a multidimensional space where dimensions reflect any characteristic of minds that allows them to be individuated. Individual differences in the representation of minds and the accuracy of mental state inferences are explained by one's model of how minds can vary (Mind-space) and ability to locate an individual mind within this space. We measured the accuracy of participants' model of the covariance between dimensions in Mind-space that represent personality traits, and we found this was associated with the accuracy of mental state inference (Experiment 1). Mind-space accuracy also predicted the ability to locate others within Mind-space on dimensions of personality and intelligence (Experiment 2). Direct evidence for the representation of minds in mental state inference was obtained by showing that the location of others in Mind-space affects the probability of particular mental states being ascribed to them (Experiment 3). This latter effect extended to mental states dependent upon representation of trait covariation (Experiment 4). Results support the claim that mental state inference varies according to location in Mind-space, and therefore that adopting the Mind-space framework can explain some of the individual differences in theory of mind.

From the initial patient encounter, artificial intelligence may aid in pretreatment disease outcome and toxicity prediction. It may subsequently aid in treatment planning, and enhanced dose optimization. Artificial intelligence may also optimize the quality assurance process and support a higher level of safety, quality, and efficiency of care.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice.\nKey challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes.\nThe safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.",

    "abstract": "The ability of nursing undergraduates to communicate effectively with health care providers, patients, and their family members is crucial to their nursing professions as these can affect patient outcomes. However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings.\nThe aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings.\nThe stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D.\nThe VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training.\nThe creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation.",

    "abstract": "We developed an unbiased framework to study the association of several mutations in predicting resistance to hypomethylating agents (HMAs) in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), analogous to consumer and commercial recommender systems in which customers who bought products A and B are likely to buy C: patients who have a mutation in gene A and gene B are likely to respond or not respond to HMAs.\nWe screened a cohort of 433 patients with MDS who received HMAs for the presence of common myeloid mutations in 29 genes that were obtained before the patients started therapy. The association between mutations and response was evaluated by the Apriori market basket analysis algorithm. Rules with the highest confidence (confidence that the association exists) and the highest lift (strength of the association) were chosen. We validated our biomarkers in samples from patients enrolled in the S1117 trial.\nAmong 433 patients, 193 (45%) received azacitidine, 176 (40%) received decitabine, and 64 (15%) received HMA alone or in combination. The median age was 70 years (range, 31 to 100 years), and 28% were female. The median number of mutations per sample was three (range, zero to nine), and 176 patients (41%) had three or more mutations per sample. Association rules identified several genomic combinations as being highly associated with no response. These molecular signatures were present in 30% of patients with three or more mutations/sample with an accuracy rate of 87% in the training cohort and 93% in the validation cohort.\nGenomic biomarkers can identify, with high accuracy, approximately one third of patients with MDS who will not respond to HMAs. This study highlights the importance of machine learning technologies such as the recommender system algorithm in translating genomic data into useful clinical tools.",

    "abstract": "In this work, an ontology-based model for AI-assisted medicine side-effect (SE) prediction is developed, where three main components, including the drug model, the treatment model, and the AI-assisted prediction model, of the proposed model are presented. To validate the proposed model, an ANN structure is established and trained by two hundred forty-two TCM prescriptions. These data are gathered and classified from the most famous ancient TCM book, and more than one thousand SE reports, in which two ontology-based attributions, hot and cold, are introduced to evaluate whether the prescription will cause SE or not. The results preliminarily reveal that it is a relationship between the ontology-based attributions and the corresponding predicted indicator that can be learnt by AI for predicting the SE, which suggests the proposed model has a potential in AI-assisted SE prediction. However, it should be noted that the proposed model highly depends on the sufficient clinic data, and hereby, much deeper exploration is important for enhancing the accuracy of the prediction.",

    "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis and prognosis are essential in lung cancer treatment selection and planning. With the rapid advance of medical imaging technology, whole slide imaging (WSI) in pathology is becoming a routine clinical procedure. An interplay of needs and challenges exists for computer-aided diagnosis based on accurate and efficient analysis of pathology images. Recently, artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, has shown great potential in pathology image analysis tasks such as tumor region identification, prognosis prediction, tumor microenvironment characterization, and metastasis detection.\nIn this review, we aim to provide an overview of current and potential applications for AI methods in pathology image analysis, with an emphasis on lung cancer.\nWe outlined the current challenges and opportunities in lung cancer pathology image analysis, discussed the recent deep learning developments that could potentially impact digital pathology in lung cancer, and summarized the existing applications of deep learning algorithms in lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis.\nWith the advance of technology, digital pathology could have great potential impacts in lung cancer patient care. We point out some promising future directions for lung cancer pathology image analysis, including multi-task learning, transfer learning, and model interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Over the next decade, one issue which will dominate sociotechnical studies in health informatics is the extent to which the promise of artificial intelligence in health care will be realized, along with the social and ethical issues which accompany it. A useful thought experiment is the application of the Turing test to user-facing artificial intelligence systems in health care (such as chatbots or conversational agents). In this paper I argue that many medical decisions require value judgements and the doctor-patient relationship requires empathy and understanding to arrive at a shared decision, often handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably, medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Artificial intelligence therefore needs to supplement rather than replace medical professionals, and identifying the complementary positioning of artificial intelligence in medical consultation is a key challenge for the future. In health care, artificial intelligence needs to pass the implementation game, not the imitation game.",

We examined the role of dimensions of emotional intelligence in predicting coping reactions to stress in 201 college nursing practitioners in this cross-sectional study between November 2017 and January 2018. The nurses appraised their own emotions, but they were not sure that appraised others' emotions, regulated their and others' emotions. They could cope with new ideas and faced obstacles. Most of the nurses were moderately stressed. Those nurses were not able to regulate their own emotions were determined to have a higher level of perceived stress. Active coping, positive reframing and acceptance were the most prevalent coping mechanisms. The investigation showed that others' emotion appraisal was a predictor for self-blame reaction, and emotion utilization was the predictor for positive reframing and self-blame.",

    "abstract": "The current research comprehensively examined how grandiose and vulnerable narcissism are linked to intelligence and intelligence-related beliefs and emotions.\nIn four studies (total N\u00a0=\u00a01,141), we tested the associations between both forms of narcissism, subjectively and objectively assessed intelligence, basic personality traits, test-related stress, beliefs about intelligence, and well-being.\nBoth forms of narcissism (grandiose and vulnerable) were unrelated to objective intelligence. Grandiose narcissism was associated with high self-perceived intelligence (Studies 1-3) and explained more variance in self-perceived intelligence than objective intelligence and the Big Five personality traits. It was correlated with reduced distress in the context of IQ testing and low engagement in cognitive performance (Study 2). Individuals with high grandiose narcissism based their well-being (Study 3) partly on intelligence and considered intelligence important for success in different life domains, especially for social relations (Study 4). Vulnerable narcissism was unrelated to self-perceived intelligence (Studies 1-3) and went along with increased distress in the context of IQ testing (Study 2).\nThe results indicate that the topic of intelligence is of key importance for people with high grandiose narcissism psychological functioning and it also has some relevance for individuals with high vulnerable narcissism.",

    "abstract": "Radiomics is a relatively new word for the field of radiology, meaning the extraction of a high number of quantitative features from medical images. Artificial intelligence (AI) is broadly a set of advanced computational algorithms that basically learn the patterns in the data provided to make predictions on unseen data sets. Radiomics can be coupled with AI because of its better capability of handling a massive amount of data compared with the traditional statistical methods. Together, the primary purpose of these fields is to extract and analyze as much and meaningful hidden quantitative data as possible to be used in decision support. Nowadays, both radiomics and AI have been getting attention for their remarkable success in various radiological tasks, which has been met with anxiety by most of the radiologists due to the fear of replacement by intelligent machines. Considering ever-developing advances in computational power and availability of large data sets, the marriage of humans and machines in future clinical practice seems inevitable. Therefore, regardless of their feelings, the radiologists should be familiar with these concepts. Our goal in this paper was three-fold: first, to familiarize radiologists with the radiomics and AI; second, to encourage the radiologists to get involved in these ever-developing fields; and, third, to provide a set of recommendations for good practice in design and assessment of future works.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the problem of responsibility attribution raised by the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. It is assumed that only humans can be responsible agents; yet this alone already raises many issues, which are discussed starting from two Aristotelian conditions for responsibility. Next to the well-known problem of many hands, the issue of \"many things\" is identified and the temporal dimension is emphasized when it comes to the control condition. Special attention is given to the epistemic condition, which draws attention to the issues of transparency and explainability. In contrast to standard discussions, however, it is then argued that this knowledge problem regarding agents of responsibility is linked to the other side of the responsibility relation: the addressees or \"patients\" of responsibility, who may demand reasons for actions and decisions made by using AI. Inspired by a relational approach, responsibility as answerability thus offers an important additional, if not primary, justification for explainability based, not on agency, but on patiency.",

    "abstract": "In this study, artificial intelligence models that identify sunn pest-damaged wheat grains (SDG) and healthy wheat grains (HWG) are presented. Svevo durum wheat cultivated in Konya province, Turkey is used for the process, with 150 HWG and 150 SDG being used for classification. Thanks to the constructed imaging setup, photos of the 300 wheat grains are obtained. Seventeen visual features of each wheat grain are extracted by image-processing techniques and evaluated in three different groups of dimension, texture and pattern as visual parameters. Artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization-based artificial neural network (ANN) and extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithms are implemented to classify the damaged wheat grains.\nA correlation-based feature selection (CFS) technique is also utilized to find the most effective among the 17 features. In the classification process using five selected features, the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values for ABC-based ANN are calculated as 0.00174 and 0.00433 respectively. The proposed technique is integrated into graphical user interface (GUI) software to construct an effective detection system for practical use.\nThe results indicate that, thanks to the modified ANN algorithm and implemented CFS algorithm, the detection accuracy of damaged wheat grains is considerably increased. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is a highly polysemic term. In computer science, with the objective of being able to solve totally new problems in new contexts, artificial intelligence includes connectionism (neural networks) for learning and logics for reasoning. Artificial intelligence algorithms mimic tasks normally requiring human intelligence, like deduction, induction, and abduction. All apply to radiation oncology. Combined with radiomics, neural networks have obtained good results in image classification, natural language processing, phenotyping based on electronic health records, and adaptive radiation therapy. General adversial networks have been tested to generate synthetic data. Logics based systems have been developed for providing formal domain ontologies, supporting clinical decision and checking consistency of the systems. Artificial intelligence must integrate both deep learning and logic approaches to perform complex tasks and go beyond the so-called narrow artificial intelligence that is tailored to perform some highly specialized task. Combined together with mechanistic models, artificial intelligence has the potential to provide new tools such as digital twins for precision oncology.",

    "abstract": "Toxicologic pathology is transitioning from analog to digital methods. This transition seems inevitable due to a host of ongoing social and medical technological forces. Of these, artificial intelligence (AI) and in particular machine learning (ML) are globally disruptive, rapidly growing sectors of technology whose impact on the long-established field of histopathology is quickly being realized. The development of increasing numbers of algorithms, peering ever deeper into the histopathological space, has demonstrated to the scientific community that AI pathology platforms are now poised to truly impact the future of precision and personalized medicine. However, as with all great technological advances, there are implementation and adoption challenges. This review aims to define common and relevant AI and ML terminology, describe data generation and interpretation, outline current and potential future business cases, discuss validation and regulatory hurdles, and most importantly, propose how overcoming the challenges of this burgeoning technology may shape toxicologic pathology for years to come, enabling pathologists to contribute even more effectively to answering scientific questions and solving global health issues.

    "abstract": "This article presents the results of a training program in emotional intelligence.\nEmotional Intelligence (EI) involves two important competencies: (1) the ability to recognize feelings and emotions in oneself and others, and (2) the ability to use that information to resolve conflicts and problems to improve interactions with others. We provided a 30-hour Training Course on Emotional Intelligence (TCEI) for 54 senior managers of a private company. A pretest-posttest design with a control group was adopted.\nEI assessed using mixed and ability-based measures can be improved after training.\nThe study's results revealed that EI can be improved within business environments. Results and implications of including EI training in professional development plans for private organizations are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Adverse effects induced by drug-drug interactions may result in early termination of drug development or even withdrawal of drugs from the market, and many drug-drug interactions are caused by the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. Therefore, the accurate prediction of the inhibition capability of a given compound against a specific CYP450 isoform is highly desirable. In this study, three ensemble learning methods, including random forest, gradient boosting decision tree, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and two deep learning methods, including deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks, were used to develop classification models to discriminate inhibitors and noninhibitors for five major CYP450 isoforms (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4). The results demonstrate that the ensemble learning models generally give better predictions than the deep learning models for the external test sets. Among all of the models, the XGBoost models achieve the best classification capability (average prediction accuracy of 90.4%) for the test sets, which even outperform the previously reported model developed by the multitask deep autoencoder neural network (88.5%). The Shapley additive explanation method was then used to interpret the models and analyze the misclassified molecules. The important molecular descriptors given by our models are consistent with the structural preferences for inhibitors of different CYP450 isoforms, which may provide valuable clues to detect potential drug-drug interactions in the early stage of drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma is a result of irreversible damage to the retinal ganglion cells. While an early intervention could minimise the risk of vision loss in glaucoma, its asymptomatic nature makes it difficult to diagnose until a late stage. The diagnosis of glaucoma is a complicated and expensive effort that is heavily dependent on the experience and expertise of a clinician. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in ophthalmology has improved our understanding of many retinal, macular, choroidal and corneal pathologies. With the advent of deep learning, a number of tools for the classification, segmentation and enhancement of ocular images have been developed. Over the years, several AI techniques have been proposed to help detect glaucoma by analysis of functional and/or structural evaluations of the eye. Moreover, the use of AI has also been explored to improve the reliability of ascribing disease prognosis. This review summarises the role of AI in the diagnosis and prognosis of glaucoma, discusses the advantages and challenges of using AI systems in clinics and predicts likely areas of future progress.",

    "abstract": "We investigate opportunities and challenges for improving unsupervised machine learning using four common strategies with a long history in physics: divide and conquer, Occam's razor, unification, and lifelong learning. Instead of using one model to learn everything, we propose a paradigm centered around the learning and manipulation of theories, which parsimoniously predict both aspects of the future (from past observations) and the domain in which these predictions are accurate. Specifically, we propose a generalized mean loss to encourage each theory to specialize in its comparatively advantageous domain, and a differentiable description length objective to downweight bad data and \"snap\" learned theories into simple symbolic formulas. Theories are stored in a \"theory hub,\" which continuously unifies learned theories and can propose theories when encountering new environments. We test our implementation, the toy \"artificial intelligence physicist\" learning agent, on a suite of increasingly complex physics environments. From unsupervised observation of trajectories through worlds involving random combinations of gravity, electromagnetism, harmonic motion, and elastic bounces, our agent typically learns faster and produces mean-squared prediction errors about a billion times smaller than a standard feedforward neural net of comparable complexity, typically recovering integer and rational theory parameters exactly. Our agent successfully identifies domains with different laws of motion also for a nonlinear chaotic double pendulum in a piecewise constant force field.",

The present review summarizes current publications on the use of AI in GI endoscopy and focuses on the challenges and future of AI-aided systems. We expect AI to provide an effective and practical method for endoscopists in lesion detection and characterization as well as in quality control in endoscopy. However, so far, most studies have remained at the preclinical stage. More attention should be paid in the future to the use of AI in real-life clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have been published on a variety of clinical applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for sepsis, while there is no overview of the literature. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the literature and thereby identify knowledge gaps and prioritize areas with high priority for further research. A literature search was conducted in PubMed from inception to February 2019. Search terms related to AI were combined with terms regarding sepsis. Articles were included when they reported an area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUROC) as outcome measure. Fifteen articles on diagnosis of sepsis with AI models were included. The best performing model reached an AUROC of 0.97. There were also seven articles on prognosis, predicting mortality over time with an AUROC of up to 0.895. Finally, there were three articles on assistance of treatment of sepsis, where the use of AI was associated with the lowest mortality rates. Of the articles, twenty-two were judged to be at high risk of bias or had major concerns regarding applicability. This was mostly because predictor variables in these models, such as blood pressure, were also part of the definition of sepsis, which led to overestimation of the performance. We conclude that AI models have great potential for improving early identification of patients who may benefit from administration of antibiotics. Current AI prediction models to diagnose sepsis are at major risks of bias when the diagnosis criteria are part of the predictor variables in the model. Furthermore, generalizability of these models is poor due to overfitting and a lack of standardized protocols for the construction and validation of the models. Until these problems have been resolved, a large gap remains between the creation of an AI algorithm and its implementation in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Although it is well known that adolescent delinquent behavior is related to poor outcomes in adulthood, longitudinal research on specific acts of delinquency and their interplay with important individual characteristics in predicting future outcomes is scarce. We aimed to examine how physical fighting-one of the most common acts of violent delinquency among adolescent boys-is related to adult life success in several domains, and how intelligence influences these associations. The study used data from 1,083 boys that participated in the population-based longitudinal Young in Norway Study, following adolescents from 1992 to 2015, by combining self-reports at four time points with comprehensive information from registers. Results showed that adolescent boys' physical fighting was associated with poor adult outcomes in the domains of employment, education, and criminal behavior. Associations remained significant even after controlling for conduct problems in general-which isolated the effects of fighting from other delinquent acts-as well as from a variety of other potential confounders. Detailed analyses on the interplay of physical fighting and intelligence showed that some parts of the associations between adolescent boys' fighting and several adverse adult outcomes could be ascribed to lower intelligence among the fighters. Moreover, intelligence moderated the relationship between physical fighting and adult education. Adolescent fighting was not related to educational attainment among boys with high intelligence, whereas boys with lower intelligence experienced detrimental effects of adolescent fighting. The analyses show the importance of considering adolescent boys' physical fighting as a potential risk factor for future social marginalization.",

    "abstract": "The domain of healthcare has always been flooded with a huge amount of complex data, coming in at a very fast-pace. A vast amount of data is generated in different sectors of healthcare industry: data from hospitals and healthcare providers, medical insurance, medical equipment, life sciences and medical research. With the advancement in technology, there is a huge potential for utilization of this data for transforming healthcare. The application of analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence over big data enables identification of patterns and correlations and hence provides actionable insights for improving the delivery of healthcare. There have been many contributions to the literature in this topic, but we lack a comprehensive view of the current state of research and application. This paper focuses on assessing the available literature in order to provide the researchers with evidence that enable fostering further development in this area. A systematic mapping study was conducted to identify and analyze research on big data analytics and artificial intelligence in healthcare, in which 2421 articles between 2013 and February 2019 were evaluated. The results of this study will help understand the needs in application of these technologies in healthcare by identifying the areas that require additional research. It will hence provide the researchers and industry experts with a base for future work.",

    "abstract": "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to drug discovery has become a hot topic in recent years. Generative molecular design based on deep learning is a particular an area of attention. Zhavoronkov et\u00a0al. recently published a novel approach in which de novo molecular design based on deep learning was used to discover novel potent DDR1 kinase inhibitors. It took 21\u00a0days from model building to compound design, and a total of six AI-designed compounds were synthesized and tested. The study highlights how quickly the field of AI-designed compounds is developing, and we can expect further developments in the coming years.",

    "abstract": "Epidemic intelligence (EI) for emerging infections is the process of identifying key information on emerging infectious diseases and specific incidents. Automated web-based infectious disease surveillance technologies are available; however, human input is still needed to review, validate, and interpret these sources. In this study, entries captured by Public Health England's (PHE) manual event-based EI system were examined to inform future intelligence gathering activities.\nA descriptive analysis of unique events captured in a database between 2013 and 2017 was conducted. The top five diseases in terms of the number of entries were described in depth to determine the effectiveness of PHE's EI surveillance system compared to other sources.\nBetween 2013 and 2017, a total of 22 847 unique entries were added to the database. The top three initial and definitive information sources varied considerably by disease. Ebola entries dominated the database, making up 23.7% of the total, followed by Zika (11.8%), Middle East respiratory syndrome (6.7%), cholera (5.5%), and yellow fever and undiagnosed morbidity (both 3.3%). Initial reports of major outbreaks due to the top five disease agents were picked up through the manual system prior to being publicly reported by official sources.\nPHE's manual EI process quickly and accurately detected global public health threats at the earliest stages and allowed for monitoring of events as they evolved.",

    "abstract": "Concussion, also referred to as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is the most common type of traumatic brain injury. Currently concussion is an area ofintensescientific interest to better understand the biological mechanisms and for biomarker development. We evaluated whole genome-wide blood DNA cytosine ('CpG') methylation in 17 pediatric concussion isolated cases and 18 unaffected controls using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC assay. Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to help elucidate the epigenetic and molecular mechanisms of the disorder. Area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) curves and FDR p-values were calculated for mTBI detection based on CpG methylation levels. Multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) platforms including Deep Learning (DL), the newest form of AI, were used to predict concussion based on i) CpG methylation markers alone, and ii) combined epigenetic, clinical and demographic predictors. We found 449 CpG sites (473 genes), those were statistically significantly methylated in mTBI compared to controls. There were four CpGs with excellent individual accuracy (AUC\u202f\u2265\u202f0.90-1.00) while 119 displayed good accuracy (AUC\u202f\u2265\u202f0.80-0.89) for the prediction of mTBI. The CpG methylation changes \u226510% were observed in many CpG loci after concussion suggesting biological significance. Pathway analysis identified several biologically important neurological pathways that were perturbed including those associated with: impaired brain function, cognition, memory, neurotransmission, intellectual disability and behavioral change and associated disorders. The combination of epigenomic and clinical predictors were highly accurate for the detection of concusion using AI techniques. Using DL/AI, a combination of epigenomic and clinical markers had sensitivity and specificity \u226795% for prediction of mTBI. In this novel study, we identified significant methylation changes in multiple genes in response to mTBI. Gene pathways that were epigenetically dysregulated included several known to be involved in neurological function, thus giving biological plausibility to our findings.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) neural networks have only recently been employed to interpret chest radiography (CXR) to screen and triage people for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). No published studies have compared multiple DL systems and populations. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of three DL systems (CAD4TB, Lunit INSIGHT, and qXR) for detecting TB-associated abnormalities in chest radiographs from outpatients in Nepal and Cameroon. All 1196 individuals received a Xpert MTB/RIF assay and a CXR read by two groups of radiologists and the DL systems. Xpert was used as the reference standard. The area under the curve of the three systems was similar: Lunit (0.94, 95% CI: 0.93-0.96), qXR (0.94, 95% CI: 0.92-0.97) and CAD4TB (0.92, 95% CI: 0.90-0.95). When matching the sensitivity of the radiologists, the specificities of the DL systems were significantly higher except for one. Using DL systems to read CXRs could reduce the number of Xpert MTB/RIF tests needed by 66% while maintaining sensitivity at 95% or better. Using a universal cutoff score resulted different performance in each site, highlighting the need to select scores based on the population screened. These DL systems should be considered by TB programs where human resources are constrained, and automated technology is available.",

    "abstract": "Poor quality primary health care is a major issue in China, particularly in blindness prevention. Artificial intelligence (AI) could provide early screening and accurate auxiliary diagnosis to improve primary care services and reduce unnecessary referrals, but the application of AI in medical settings is still an emerging field.\nThis study aimed to investigate the general public's acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices, with reference to those already used in China, and the interrelated influencing factors that shape people's intention to use these devices.\nWe proposed a model of ophthalmic AI acceptance based on technology acceptance theories and variables from other health care-related studies. The model was verified via a 32-item questionnaire with 7-point Likert scales completed by 474 respondents (nationally random sampled). Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate item and construct reliability and validity via a confirmatory factor analysis, and the model's path effects, significance, goodness of fit, and mediation and moderation effects were analyzed.\nStandardized factor loadings of items were between 0.583 and 0.876.

The influence of subjective norms can be linked to Confucian culture, collectivism, authoritarianism, and conformity mentality in China. Overall, the use of AI in diagnostics and clinical laboratory analysis is underdeveloped, and the Chinese public are generally mistrustful of medical staff and the Chinese medical system. Stakeholders such as doctors and AI suppliers should therefore avoid making misleading or over-exaggerated claims in the promotion of AI health care products.",

Exploratory factor analyses revealed a four-factor model of emotional intelligence: (1) confusion, (2) acceptance, (3) rejection, and (4) insight.

    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms can help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, selection of personalized therapies and prediction of long-term outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) describes a subset of machine learning that can identify patterns in data and take actions to reach pre-set goals without specific programming. Machine learning tools can help to identify high-risk populations, prescribe personalized screening tests and enrich patient populations that are most likely to benefit from advanced imaging tests. AI algorithms can also help to plan personalized therapies and predict the impact of genomic variations on the sensitivity of normal and tumor tissue to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The two main bottlenecks for successful AI applications in pediatric oncology imaging to date are the needs for large data sets and appropriate computer and memory power. With appropriate data entry and processing power, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can process large amounts of imaging data, clinical data and medical literature in very short periods of time and thereby accelerate literature reviews, correct diagnoses and personalized treatments. This article provides a focused review of emerging AI applications that are relevant for the pediatric oncology imaging community.",

    "abstract": "The differential diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) is challenging. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning algorithms have started being used to an increasing extent in disease diagnosis due to the high level of efficiency, objectivity, and accuracy that they offer.\nData samples on 192 patients with TPE, 54 patients with parapneumonic pleural effusion (PPE), and 197 patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE) were retrospectively collected. Based on 28 different features obtained via statistical analysis, TPE diagnostic models using four machine learning algorithms (MLAs), namely logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) were established and their respective diagnostic performances were calculated. The respective diagnostic performances of each of the four algorithmic models were compared with that of pleural fluid adenosine deaminase (pfADA). Based on 12 features with the most significant impacts on the accuracy of the RF model, a new RF model was designed for clinical application. To demonstrate its external validity, a prospective study was conducted and the diagnostic performance of the RF model was calculated.\nThe respective sensitivity and specificity of each of the four TPE diagnostic models were as follows: logistic regression - 80.5 and 84.8%; KNN- 78.6 and 86.6%; SVM - 83.2 and 85.9%; and RF - 89.1 and 93.6%. The sensitivity and specificity of pfADA were 85.4 and 84.1%, respectively, at the best cut-off value of 17.5\u2009U/L. RF was the superior method among the four MLAs, and was also superior to pfADA. The newly designed RF model (based on 12 out of 28 features) exhibited an acceptable performance rate for the diagnosis of TPE with a sensitivity and specificity of 90.6 and 92.3%, respectively. In the prospective study, its sensitivity and specificity were 100.0 and 90.0%, respectively.\nEstablishing a model for the diagnosis of TPE using RF resulted in a more effective, economical, and faster diagnostic method. This method could enable clinicians to diagnose and treat TPE more effectively.",

    "abstract": "A high proportion of suspicious pigmented skin lesions referred for investigation are benign. Techniques to improve the accuracy of melanoma diagnoses throughout the patient pathway are needed to reduce the pressure on secondary care and pathology services.\nTo determine the accuracy of an artificial intelligence algorithm in identifying melanoma in dermoscopic images of lesions taken with smartphone and digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras.\nThis prospective, multicenter, single-arm, masked diagnostic trial took place in dermatology and plastic surgery clinics in 7 UK hospitals. Dermoscopic images of suspicious and control skin lesions from 514 patients with at least 1 suspicious pigmented skin lesion scheduled for biopsy were captured on 3 different cameras. Data were collected from January 2017 to July 2018. Clinicians and the Deep Ensemble for Recognition of Malignancy, a deterministic artificial intelligence algorithm trained to identify melanoma in dermoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions using deep learning techniques, assessed the likelihood of melanoma. Initial data analysis was conducted in September 2018; further analysis was conducted from February 2019 to August 2019.\nClinician and algorithmic assessment of melanoma.\nArea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity of the algorithmic and specialist assessment, determined using histopathology diagnosis as the criterion standard.\nThe study population of 514 patients included 279 women (55.7%) and 484 white patients (96.8%), with a mean (SD) age of 52.1 (18.6) years. A total of 1550 images of skin lesions were included in the analysis (551 [35.6%] biopsied lesions; 999 [64.4%] control lesions); 286 images (18.6%) were used to train the algorithm, and a further 849 (54.8%) images were missing or unsuitable for analysis. Of the biopsied lesions that were assessed by the algorithm and specialists, 125 (22.7%) were diagnosed as melanoma. Of these, 77 (16.7%) were used for the primary analysis. The algorithm achieved an AUROC of 90.1% (95% CI, 86.3%-94.0%) for biopsied lesions and 95.8% (95% CI, 94.1%-97.6%) for all lesions using iPhone 6s images; an AUROC of 85.8% (95% CI, 81.0%-90.7%) for biopsied lesions and 93.8% (95% CI, 91.4%-96.2%) for all lesions using Galaxy S6 images; and an AUROC of 86.9% (95% CI, 80.8%-93.0%) for biopsied lesions and 91.8% (95% CI, 87.5%-96.1%) for all lesions using DSLR camera images. At 100% sensitivity, the algorithm achieved a specificity of 64.8% with iPhone 6s images. Specialists achieved an AUROC of 77.8% (95% CI, 72.5%-81.9%) and a specificity of 69.9%.\nIn this study, the algorithm demonstrated an ability to identify melanoma from dermoscopic images of selected lesions with an accuracy similar to that of specialists.",

    "abstract": "Health care systems worldwide have been influenced by the globally growing trend toward a sharing economy and will likely advance with these trends in the near future. Therefore, based on peer-to-peer relationships between individuals, sharing health care works by renting medical staff, facilities, and other medical resources. Medical data innovation, integration, analysis, and sharing have the potential to dramatically change the current pattern of the health care system and to provide precise and predictive medical assessment for individuals in the future. In addition, artificial intelligence could be useful in the fields of both clinical medicine and medical research and help to minimize the scarcity of human resources and broaden the role of humans in health care.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this descriptive research paper is to initiate discussions on the use of innovative technologies and their potential to support the research and development of pan-Canadian monitoring and surveillance activities associated with environmental impacts on health and within the health system. Its primary aim is to provide a review of disruptive technologies and their current uses in the environment and in healthcare. Drawing on extensive experience in population-level surveillance through the use of technology, knowledge from prior projects in the field, and conducting a review of the technologies, this paper is meant to serve as the initial steps toward a better understanding of the research area. In doing so, we hope to be able to better assess which technologies might best be leveraged to advance this unique intersection of health and environment. This paper first outlines the current use of technologies at the intersection of public health and the environment, in particular, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The paper provides a description for each of these technologies, along with a summary of their current applications, and a description of the challenges one might face with adopting them. Thereafter, a high-level reference architecture, that addresses the challenges of the described technologies and could potentially be incorporated into the pan-Canadian surveillance system, is conceived and presented.",

    "abstract": "To exhibit social intelligence, animals have to recognize whom they are communicating with. One way to make this inference is to select among internal generative models of each conspecific who may be encountered. However, these models also have to be learned via some form of Bayesian belief updating. This induces an interesting problem: When receiving sensory input generated by a particular conspecific, how does an animal know which internal model to update? We consider a theoretical and neurobiologically plausible solution that enables inference and learning of the processes that generate sensory inputs (e.g., listening and understanding) and reproduction of those inputs (e.g., talking or singing), under multiple generative models. This is based on recent advances in theoretical neurobiology-namely, active inference and post hoc (online) Bayesian model selection. In brief, this scheme fits sensory inputs under each generative model. Model parameters are then updated in proportion to the probability that each model could have generated the input (i.e., model evidence). The proposed scheme is demonstrated using a series of (real zebra finch) birdsongs, where each song is generated by several different birds. The scheme is implemented using physiologically plausible models of birdsong production. We show that generalized Bayesian filtering, combined with model selection, leads to successful learning across generative models, each possessing different parameters. These results highlight the utility of having multiple internal models when making inferences in social environments with multiple sources of sensory information.",

To fulfill this responsibility, nurses need information on the widespread reach of AI and, perhaps more importantly, how the development, deployment and evaluation of these technologies can be influenced.",

    "abstract": "Recidivism remains a serious issue in the modern criminal justice system, with over 80% of those previously incarcerated being rearrested within 9 years of release (Alper, Durose, & Markman, 2018). Although previous studies have identified risk factors that increase the probability of rearrest, much remains unknown regarding the full constellation of risk factors. One potential risk factor that has received limited attention is intelligence, as individuals with lower IQ scores have been found to be more likely to come into initial contact with the criminal justice system. Collectively, previous studies have provided preliminary evidence of intelligence as a risk factor for rearrest but have not fully explored this association. More specifically, it remains unclear whether the association between IQ and recidivism persists after controlling for time-invariant, individual-specific sources of variance in criminal behavior. The current study aimed to address this limitation and more closely examine the longitudinal association between IQ and rearrest with data from the Pathways to Desistance Study (N = 1,331 individuals). To distinguish variance in intelligence from time-stable, individual-specific variance in criminality, we estimated a latent trait-state-occasion model. A subsequent series of survival models, which included the previously estimated measure of criminality as a covariate, revealed a small and negative association between IQ and rearrest (hazard ratio = .95; 95% confidence interval [.92; .98]), suggesting that IQ may play only a minor role in recidivism.

    "abstract": "In spite of the observation that nurse managers' style of authority in sub-Saharan Africa is one of antagonistic vibe and lordship, there is not much information on the kind of leadership provided in the hospitals by nurse managers. Following the notion that transformational leadership is a solution to many leadership problems and often creates valuable positive change in followers, this study aims to examine the level of transformational leadership behavior of nurse leaders; determining the effects of the sub-constructs of emotional intelligence (EI) on the transformational leadership behavior of leaders; and determining whether there is a difference in the exhibition of transformational leadership behavior due to the gender of leaders.\nThe study uses five of the major public hospitals in the Greater Accra Region (the capital) of Ghana. Evidence of such links would be considerable for Ghanaian healthcare providers in their quest to find potential nurse leaders to train, so as not to dwell highly on the seniority criterion in the selection of leaders. Using a quantitative approach, the Wong Law EI Scale (2002) and leadership items adapted from Rafferty and Griffin (2004) were used to collect the data. A descriptive statistics (mean) revealed that nurse leaders from the selected hospitals exhibited a high level (M= 3.90, SD\u2009=\u20090.14) of transformational leadership behavior.\nA multiple regression analysis revealed that three of the sub-constructs of EI significantly affected transformational leadership with the \"self-emotion appraisal\" construct having the strongest effect on transformational leadership behavior (\nBased on the findings, when leaders are trained to be emotionally intelligent and their skills are fostered, they are more likely to exhibit transformational leadership behaviors, which will further result in organizational effectiveness and follower satisfaction. Hospitals must focus on the control of one's emotions at work, and subsequently, understanding others' emotions. In developing transformational leaders, there is the need to identify some tools that will increase EI level, more specifically, traits related to the understanding of others' emotion. The findings from this study indicate that one of the factors to check when selecting nurse leaders should be their EI and not necessarily a matter of seniority in many cases in emerging economies.\nThe originality of this study is in the fact that it focuses on an emerging economy, which is under researched. In Ghana, the criteria for promotion of nurse leaders' is based strictly on seniority and age and not on factors such as the leaders EI. The profession of nursing is such that leaders need to understand that certain soft skills such as EI are considered necessary to transform the hospitals and staff they lead. This study, therefore, sheds light on these key areas from the perspective of an emerging economy, which are usually not in the domain of literature in the area of healthcare leadership.",

    "abstract": "There is currently no other hot topic like the ability of current technology to develop capabilities similar to those of human beings, even in medicine. This ability to simulate the processes of human intelligence with computer systems is known as artificial intelligence (AI). This article aims to clarify the various terms that still sound foreign to us, such as AI, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and big data. It also provides an in-depth description of the concept of AI and its types; the learning techniques and technology used by ML; cardiac imaging analysis with DL; and the contribution of this technological revolution to classical statistics, as well as its current limitations, legal aspects, and initial applications in cardiology. To do this, we conducted a detailed PubMed search on the evolution of original contributions on AI to the various areas of application in cardiology in the last 5 years and identified 673 research articles. We provide 19 detailed examples from distinct areas of cardiology that, by using AI, have shown diagnostic and therapeutic improvements, and which will aid understanding of ML and DL methodology.",

    "abstract": "Zuckerman et al. (2013) conducted a meta-analysis of 63 studies that showed a negative intelligence-religiosity relation (IRR). As more studies have become available and because some of Zuckerman et al.'s (2013) conclusions have been challenged, we conducted a new meta-analysis with an updated data set of 83 studies. Confirming previous conclusions, the new analysis showed that the correlation between intelligence and religious beliefs in college and noncollege samples ranged from -.20 to -.23. There was no support for mediation of the IRR by education but there was support for partial mediation by analytic cognitive style. Thus, one possible interpretation for the IRR is that intelligent people are more likely to use analytic style (i.e., approach problems more rationally). An alternative (and less interesting) reason for the mediation is that tests of both intelligence and analytic style assess cognitive ability. Additional empirical and theoretical work is needed to resolve this issue.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 20% of individual with pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) have a lifetime history of suicide attempt. Some cognitive measures were associated with a suicide attempt, but no study has assessed the association of this event with the estimated intelligence quotient (IQ) in PBI. In adult Bipolar Disorder no association between IQ and suicidality was found, with different correlations between cognitive measures. There are studies in general population showing a negative correlation and others did not find any association. In Schizophrenia, IQ had a positive correlation with suicide attempt. So, the correlation between IQ and suicidality still controversial.\nWe recruited 63 children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age with PBD based on DSM-IV criteria from an outpatient clinic in Brazil. Manic and depressive symptoms were assessed with the YMRS and CDRS, respectively. Estimated IQ was assessed with the WISC-III. The presence or absense of suicidal attempt, clinical and demographic variables were assessed with the K-SADS-PL-W.\nPatients who attempted suicide had lower estimated IQ compared to patients who did not attempt suicide (82.72\u202f\u00b1\u202f18.70\u202fvs. 101.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f14.36; p\u202f=\u202f0.009). This finding remained after correction for depressive symptoms and family income (OR\u202f=\u202f0.94; 95% CI\u202f=\u202f0.89 - 0.99; p\u202f=\u202f0.029).\nSmall sample, reverse causality could not be discarded, we only used two subscales of the WISC-III to estimate intelligence.\nEstimated IQ and suicide attempts were negative correlated in PBD.

    "abstract": "To identify the multivariate logistic regression in a combination (combination method) involving artificial intelligence (AI) classifiers in images of blastocysts along with a conventional embryo evaluation (CEE) to predict the probability of accomplishing a live birth in patients classified by maternal age.\nRetrospectively, a total of 5691 blastocysts were enrolled. Images captured 115\u00a0hours or 139\u00a0hours if not yet sufficiently large after insemination were classified according to age as follows: <35, 35-37, 38-39, 40-41, and \u226542\u00a0years old. The classifiers for each category were created by using convolutional neural networks associated with deep learning. Next, the feasibility of a method combining AI with multivariate logistic model functions by CEE was investigated.\nThe values of the area under the curve (AUC) and the accuracies to predict live birth achieved by the CEE/AI/combination methods were 0.651/0.634/0.655, 0.697/0.688/0.723, 0.771/0.728/0.791, 0.788/0.743/0.806 and 0.820/0.837/0.888, and 0.631/0.647/0.616, 0.687/0.675/0.671, 0.725/0.697/0.732, 0.714/0.776/0.801, and 0.910/0.866/0.784 for age categories of <35, 35-37, 38-39, 40-41, and \u226542\u00a0years old, respectively.\nThough there were mostly no significant differences regarding the AUC and the sensitivity plus specificity in all age categories, the combination method seemed to be the best.",

    "abstract": "Empathy and emotional intelligence (EI) of a dentist are two factors vital for developing fruitful relations between clinicians and patients. Establishing a good relationship with patients may improve patients' outcomes. Data on empathy and EI in dental practitioners in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is scarce.\nHence, we aimed to evaluate and compare empathy and EI among dental practitioners in Abha and Khamis Mushayat cities of Saudi Arabia.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional survey study. A total of 183 dental practitioners who were reachable at survey time were included. A self-administered questionnaire on empathy and EI was structured based on Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (health professions version) and Schutte's Emotional Intelligence Scale, respectively. Statistical analysis was done using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests.\nNo significant difference was observed between both genders regarding empathy and EI (P = 0.73 and 0.97, respectively). Similarly, no significant difference was observed between participants with different qualifications or different work settings (P > 0.05). However, a statistically significant positive correlation was observed between empathy and EI (r = 0.722).\nIrrespective of gender, qualification, or different work settings, dental practitioners in both cities showed adequate empathy and EI levels. Dentists with high empathy scores seem to show high EI levels.\nEvaluating and monitoring empathy and EI practice among dental practitioners have paramount importance to improve clinical practice and healing potential of patients. Low levels of empathy and EI practice would suggest modifications to training curriculum or healthcare policies.",

    "abstract": "Using artificial intelligence techniques, we compute optimal personalized protocols for temozolomide administration in a population of patients with variability.\nOur optimizations are based on a Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model with population variability for temozolomide, inspired by Faivre et al. [10] and Panetta et al. [25,26]. The patient pharmacokinetic parameters can only be partially observed at admission and are progressively learned by Bayesian inference during treatment. For every patient, we seek to minimize tumor size while avoiding severe toxicity, i.e. maintaining an acceptable toxicity level. The optimization algorithm we rely on borrows from the field of artificial intelligence.\nOptimal personalized protocols (OPP) achieve a sizable decrease in tumor size at the population level but also patient-wise. The tumor size is on average 67.2\u202fg lighter than with the standard maximum-tolerated dose protocol (MTD) after 336 days (12 MTD cycles). The corresponding 90% confidence interval for average tumor size reduction amounts to 58.6-82.7\u202fg. When treated with OPP, less patients experience severe toxicity in comparison to MTD.\nWe quantify in-silico the benefits offered by personalized oncology in the case of temozolomide administration. To do so, we compute optimal personalized protocols for a population of heterogeneous patients using artificial intelligence techniques. At each treatment day, the protocol is updated by taking into account the feedback obtained from patient's reaction to the drug administration. Personalized protocols greatly differ from each other, and from the standard MTD protocol. Benefits of personalization are very sizable: tumor sizes are much smaller on average and also patient-wise, while severe toxicity is made less frequent.",

A linear regression model combining physician and EWS predictions had an AUROC of 0.75, outperforming physicians (p=0.016) and the EWS (p=0.05).\nThere is no significant difference in the performance of the EWS and physicians in predicting clinical deterioration at 24\u2009hours on an inpatient general medicine ward. A combined model outperformed either alone. The EWS and physicians identify partially overlapping sets of at-risk patients suggesting they rely on different cues or decision rules for their predictions.\nNCT02648828.",

    "abstract": "Telemedicine is an essential support system for clinical settings outside the hospital. Recently, the importance of the model for assessment of telemedicine (MAST) has been emphasised. The development of an eHealth-supported wound assessment system using artificial intelligence is awaited. This study explored whether or not wound segmentation of a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) and a venous leg ulcer (VLU) by a convolutional neural network (CNN) was possible after being educated using sacral pressure ulcer (PU) data sets, and which CNN architecture was superior at segmentation.\nCNNs with different algorithms and architectures were prepared. The four architectures were SegNet, LinkNet, U-Net and U-Net with the VGG16 Encoder Pre-Trained on ImageNet (Unet_VGG16). Each CNN learned the supervised data of sacral pressure ulcers (PUs).\nAmong the four architectures, the best results were obtained with U-Net. U-Net demonstrated the second-highest accuracy in terms of the area under the curve (0.997) and a high specificity (0.943) and sensitivity (0.993), with the highest values obtained with Unet_VGG16. U-Net was also considered to be the most practical architecture and superior to the others in that the segmentation speed was faster than that of Unet_VGG16.\nThe U-Net CNN constructed using appropriately supervised data was capable of segmentation with high accuracy. These findings suggest that eHealth wound assessment using CNNs will be of practical use in the future.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography (3D DSA) technique is the current standard and is based on both mask and fill runs to enable the subtraction technique. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based 3D angiography (3DA) was developed to reduce radiation dosage because only one contrast-enhanced run of the C\u2011arm system is required for reconstruction of DSA-like 3D volumes. The aim was the evaluation of this algorithm regarding its diagnostic information.\n3D DSA datasets without pathologic findings were reconstructed both with subtraction technique and with the AI-based algorithm. Corresponding reconstructions were evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists with respect to image quality (IQ), visualization of major segments of the circle of Willis (ICA\u202f=\u202fC4-C7; OphA; ACA\u202f=\u202fA1-A2, MCA\u202f=\u202fM1-M2; VA\u202f=\u202fV4; BA; AICA; SUCA; PCA\u202f=\u202fP1-P2), identifiability of perforators (lenticulostriate/thalamoperforating arteries) and vessel diameters (ICA\u202f=\u202fC4; MCA\u202f=\u202fM1; BA; PCA\u202f=\u202fP1).\nIn total 15 datasets were successfully reconstructed as 3D DSA and 3DA with diagnostic image quality. All major segments of the circle of Willis and perforators were comparably visualized with 3DA. Quantitative analysis of vessel diameters in 3D DSA and 3DA datasets was equivalent and did not show relevant differences (r\nThe use of 3DA demonstrated reliable visualization of cerebral vasculature with respect to quantitative and qualitative parameters.

    "abstract": "Individual differences in executive functions (EF) are heritable and predictive of academic attainment (AA). However, little is known about genetic contributions to EFs or their genetic relationship with AA and intelligence. We conducted genome-wide association analyses for processing speed (PS) and the latent EF measures of working memory (WM) and inhibitory control (IC) in 4,611 adolescents from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. While no loci reached genome-wide significance, common genetic variants explained 30% of the variance in WM and 19% in PS. In contrast, we failed to find common genetic contributions to IC. Finally, we examined shared genetic effects between EFs and general intelligence, AA and ADHD. We identified significant genetic correlations between WM, intelligence, and AA. A more specific pattern was observed for PS, with modest genetic overlap with intelligence. Together these findings highlight diversity in the genetic contributions to specific cognitive functions and their genetic relationship with educational and psychiatric outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Acute stroke caused by large vessel occlusions (LVOs) requires emergent detection and treatment by endovascular thrombectomy. However, radiologic LVO detection and treatment is subject to variable delays and human expertise, resulting in morbidity. Imaging software using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), a branch of AI, may improve rapid frontline detection of LVO strokes. This report is a systematic review of AI in acute LVO stroke identification and triage, and characterizes LVO detection software.\nA systematic review of acute stroke diagnostic-focused AI studies from January 2014 to February 2019 in PubMed, Medline, and Embase using terms: 'artificial intelligence' or 'machine learning or deep learning' and 'ischemic stroke' or 'large vessel occlusion' was performed.\nVariations of AI, including ML methods of random forest learning (RFL) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are used to detect LVO strokes. Twenty studies were identified that use ML. Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) commonly used RFL, while LVO detection typically used CNNs. Image feature detection had greater sensitivity with CNN than with RFL, 85% versus 68%. However, AI algorithm performance metrics use different standards, precluding ideal objective comparison. Four current software platforms incorporate ML: Brainomix (greatest validation of AI for ASPECTS, uses CNNs to automatically detect LVOs), General Electric, iSchemaView (largest number of perfusion study validations for thrombectomy), and Viz.ai (uses CNNs to automatically detect LVOs, then automatically activates emergency stroke treatment systems).\nAI may improve LVO stroke detection and rapid triage necessary for expedited treatment. Standardization of performance assessment is needed in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Both low intelligence and low emotional control have previously been linked to a higher risk of suicide, but it is unknown whether the associations apply consistently over the life course.\nThe study was based on data on intelligence and emotional control, collected from 48 738 Swedish men conscripted in 1969-1970, at ages 18-20 years. The data were linked to national registers giving information on subsequent suicidal behavior (completed and attempted suicide) up to the age of 59 years. The associations were investigated using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression models, with adjustment for childhood socioeconomic status.\nIntelligence and emotional control assessed in late adolescence both showed robust inverse associations with suicidal behavior over the 38-year follow-up. However, while the association between lower intelligence and higher rate of suicidal behavior remained the same throughout (~40% increased hazard per unit on a five-level scale), the association between lower emotional control and suicidal behavior was substantially stronger in early adulthood (~100% increased hazard per unit) than in late middle age (~30% increased hazard per unit).\nThe study adds to previous research by showing that the association between poor emotional control and subsequent suicide risk in men becomes weaker over the life course, while the association between low intelligence and suicide risk seems to be constant. The particularly high suicide risk of young men with poor emotional control may motivate targeted prevention efforts.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning is yielding unprecedented interest in research and industry, due to recent success in many applied contexts such as image classification and object recognition. However, the deployment of these systems requires huge computing capabilities, thus making them unsuitable for embedded systems. To deal with this limitation, many researchers are investigating brain-inspired computing, which would be a perfect alternative to the conventional Von Neumann architecture based computers (CPU/GPU) that meet the requirements for computing performance, but not for energy-efficiency. Therefore, neuromorphic hardware circuits that are adaptable for both parallel and distributed computations need to be designed. In this paper, we focus on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with a comprehensive study of neural coding methods and hardware exploration. In this context, we propose a framework for neuromorphic hardware design space exploration, which allows to define a suitable architecture based on application-specific constraints and starting from a wide variety of possible architectural choices. For this framework, we have developed a behavioral level simulator for neuromorphic hardware architectural exploration named NAXT. Moreover, we propose modified versions of the standard Rate Coding technique to make trade-offs with the Time Coding paradigm, which is characterized by the low number of spikes propagating in the network. Thus, we are able to reduce the number of spikes while keeping the same neuron's model, which results in an SNN with fewer events to process. By doing so, we seek to reduce the amount of power consumed by the hardware. Furthermore, we present three neuromorphic hardware architectures in order to quantitatively study the implementation of SNNs. One of these architectures integrates a novel hybrid structure: a highly-parallel computation core for most solicited layers, and time-multiplexed computation units for deeper layers. These architectures are derived from a novel funnel-like Design Space Exploration framework for neuromorphic hardware.",

AI is also tested to assess liver fibrosis and to differentiate patients with pancreatic cancer from those with pancreatitis. AI might also be used to establish prognoses of patients or predict their response to treatments, based on multiple factors. We review the ways in which AI may help physicians make a diagnosis or establish a prognosis and discuss its limitations, knowing that further randomized controlled studies will be required before the approval of AI techniques by the health authorities.",

    "abstract": "Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested that the neural bases of trait emotional intelligence (TEI) lie in the social cognition network (SCN) and the somatic marker circuitry (SMC). The current study was the first to investigate the associations of total TEI factors and subfactors with mean diffusivity (MD) of these networks as well as regional MD of the dopaminergic system (MDDS). We found that TEI intrapersonal factor score and total TEI score were negatively correlated with regional MDDS in the vicinity of the right putamen and right pallidum and that TEI intrapersonal factor score was negatively correlated with MD values of the fusiform gyrus. Total TEI score and TEI factor scores were positively correlated with MD values of various areas within or adjacent to SCN components, SMC structures and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). Our MD findings demonstrated the importance of the dopaminergic system to TEI and implicate the SCN, SMC and LPFC in TEI. Future studies are required to investigate the implications of positive and negative associations with MD values.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the key drivers of digital health. Digital health and AI applications in medicine and biology are emerging worldwide, not only in resource-rich but also resource-limited regions. AI predates to the mid-20th century, but the current wave of AI builds in part on machine learning (ML), big data, and algorithms that can learn from massive amounts of online user data from patients or healthy persons. There are lessons to be learned from AI applications in different medical specialties and across developed and resource-limited contexts. A case in point is congenital heart defects (CHDs) that continue to plague sub-Saharan Africa, which calls for innovative approaches to improve risk prediction and performance of the available diagnostics. Beyond CHDs, AI in cardiology is a promising context as well. The current suite of digital health applications in CHD and cardiology include complementary technologies such as neural networks, ML, natural language processing and deep learning, not to mention embedded digital sensors. Algorithms that build on these advances are beginning to complement traditional medical expertise while inviting us to redefine the concepts and definitions of expertise in molecular diagnostics and precision medicine. We examine and share here the lessons learned in current attempts to implement AI and digital health in CHD for precision risk prediction and diagnosis in resource-limited settings. These top 10 lessons on AI and digital health summarized in this expert review are relevant broadly beyond CHD in cardiology and medical innovations. As with AI itself that calls for systems approaches to data capture, analysis, and interpretation, both developed and developing countries can usefully learn from their respective experiences as digital health continues to evolve worldwide.",

    "abstract": "The practice of medicine is changing with the development of new Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods of machine learning. Coupled with rapid improvements in computer processing, these AI-based systems are already improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and treatment across various specializations. The increasing focus of AI in radiology has led to some experts suggesting that someday AI may even replace radiologists. These suggestions raise the question of whether AI-based systems will eventually replace physicians in some specializations or will augment the role of physicians without actually replacing them. To assess the impact on physicians this research seeks to better understand this technology and how it is transforming medicine. To that end this paper researches the role of AI-based systems in performing medical work in specializations including radiology, pathology, ophthalmology, and cardiology. It concludes that AI-based systems will augment physicians and are unlikely to replace the traditional physician-patient relationship.",

    "abstract": "Explaining colour variation among animals at broad geographic scales remains challenging. Here we demonstrate how deep learning-a form of artificial intelligence-can reveal subtle but robust patterns of colour feature variation along an ecological gradient, as well as help identify the underlying mechanisms generating this biogeographic pattern. Using over 20,000 images with precise GPS locality information belonging to nearly 2,000 moth species from Taiwan, our deep learning model generates a 2048-dimension feature vector that accurately predicts each species' mean elevation based on colour and shape features. Using this multidimensional feature vector, we find that within-assemblage image feature variation is smaller in high elevation assemblages. Structural equation modeling suggests that this reduced image feature diversity is likely the result of colder environments selecting for darker colouration, which limits the colour diversity of assemblages at high elevations. Ultimately, with the help of deep learning, we will be able to explore the endless forms of natural morphological variation at unpreceded depths.",

    "abstract": "Upper gastrointestinal cancers (including oesophageal cancer and gastric cancer) are the most common cancers worldwide. Artificial intelligence platforms using deep learning algorithms have made remarkable progress in medical imaging but their application in upper gastrointestinal cancers has been limited. We aimed to develop and validate the Gastrointestinal Artificial Intelligence Diagnostic System (GRAIDS) for the diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal cancers through analysis of imaging data from clinical endoscopies.\nThis multicentre, case-control, diagnostic study was done in six hospitals of different tiers (ie, municipal, provincial, and national) in China. The images of consecutive participants, aged 18 years or older, who had not had a previous endoscopy were retrieved from all participating hospitals. All patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer lesions (including oesophageal cancer and gastric cancer) that were histologically proven malignancies were eligible for this study. Only images with standard white light were deemed eligible. The images from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were randomly assigned (8:1:1) to the training and intrinsic verification datasets for developing GRAIDS, and the internal validation dataset for evaluating the performance of GRAIDS. Its diagnostic performance was evaluated using an internal and prospective validation set from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (a national hospital) and additional external validation sets from five primary care hospitals. The performance of GRAIDS was also compared with endoscopists with three degrees of expertise: expert, competent, and trainee. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of GRAIDS and endoscopists for the identification of cancerous lesions were evaluated by calculating the 95% CIs using the Clopper-Pearson method.\n1\u2008036\u2008496 endoscopy images from 84\u2008424 individuals were used to develop and test GRAIDS. The diagnostic accuracy in identifying upper gastrointestinal cancers was 0\u00b7955 (95% CI 0\u00b7952-0\u00b7957) in the internal validation set, 0\u00b7927 (0\u00b7925-0\u00b7929) in the prospective set, and ranged from 0\u00b7915 (0\u00b7913-0\u00b7917) to 0\u00b7977 (0\u00b7977-0\u00b7978) in the five external validation sets. GRAIDS achieved diagnostic sensitivity similar to that of the expert endoscopist (0\u00b7942 [95% CI 0\u00b7924-0\u00b7957] vs 0\u00b7945 [0\u00b7927-0\u00b7959]; p=0\u00b7692) and superior sensitivity compared with competent (0\u00b7858 [0\u00b7832-0\u00b7880], p<0\u00b70001) and trainee (0\u00b7722 [0\u00b7691-0\u00b7752], p<0\u00b70001) endoscopists. The positive predictive value was 0\u00b7814 (95% CI 0\u00b7788-0\u00b7838) for GRAIDS, 0\u00b7932 (0\u00b7913-0\u00b7948) for the expert endoscopist, 0\u00b7974 (0\u00b7960-0\u00b7984) for the competent endoscopist, and 0\u00b7824 (0\u00b7795-0\u00b7850) for the trainee endoscopist. The negative predictive value was 0\u00b7978 (95% CI 0\u00b7971-0\u00b7984) for GRAIDS, 0\u00b7980 (0\u00b7974-0\u00b7985) for the expert endoscopist, 0\u00b7951 (0\u00b7942-0\u00b7959) for the competent endoscopist, and 0\u00b7904 (0\u00b7893-0\u00b7916) for the trainee endoscopist.\nGRAIDS achieved high diagnostic accuracy in detecting upper gastrointestinal cancers, with sensitivity similar to that of expert endoscopists and was superior to that of non-expert endoscopists. This system could assist community-based hospitals in improving their effectiveness in upper gastrointestinal cancer diagnoses.\nThe National Key R&D Program of China, the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, the Science and Technology Program of Guangdong, the Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.",

    "abstract": "The increasing uptake of machine learning solutions for segmentation and planning leaves no doubt that artificial intelligence (AI) will soon be providing input into a range of radiotherapy procedures. Although this promises to deliver increased speed and accuracy, the future role of AI in relation to radiotherapy should be thought through carefully. There is currently a gap between published developments and widespread adoption, which provides some space to prepare the workforce and to consider the implications on practice. It is rare to find philosophical input into a medical journal, but the advent of AI makes this perspective increasingly important. Philosophical insight can help explore the potential impact of AI, in particular, on human creativity and oversight. Without this perspective, we run the risk of focusing solely on the immediate logistical impact on patients and departments. This commentary identifies three key aspects of radiotherapy that the authors feel would suffer most under AI control: creativity, innovation, and patient safety, which all demand uniquely human attributes. The article also provides insight from a philosophical perspective with regard to human consciousness, ethics, and empathy. Philosophically we should, perhaps, retain ethical concerns about the widening role of AI in radiotherapy beyond simple quantitative interpretation and image processing. As developments continue, we have time to determine how our roles will evolve and to establish a framework for ensuring appropriate human input into patient care. Most importantly, we must start to embed a philosophical approach to adoption of AI technology from the outset if we are to prepare ourselves for the challenge that lies ahead.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome affects persons of all ages and has been associated with cognitive decline. In a sample of 221 healthy adults (18.57 to 85.33 years), assessed up to 3 times (over up to 6.33 years), we applied a second-order bivariate dual-change-score model with strong factorial invariance to estimate the effects of previous levels of metabolic risk (MR) and fluid intelligence (Gf) on subsequent changes in both constructs. The results indicated that MR levels affect subsequent changes in Gf, whereas Gf does not affect changes in MR. This suggests that control of MR may be related to the change in a person's cognitive status, making early intervention, starting in young adulthood, a promising approach. To our knowledge, this is the first long-term study with such evidence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",

    "abstract": "Similar to advancements gained from big data in genomics, security, internet of things, and e-commerce, the materials workflow could be made more efficient and prolific through advances in streamlining data sources, autonomous materials synthesis, rapid characterization, big data analytics, and self-learning algorithms. In electrochemical materials science, data sets are large, unstructured/heterogeneous, and difficult to process and analyze from a single data channel or platform. Computer-aided materials design together with advances in data mining, machine learning, and predictive analytics are expected to provide inexpensive and accelerated pathways towards tailor-made functionally optimized energy materials. Fundamental research in the field of electrochemical energy materials focuses primarily on complex interfacial phenomena and kinetic electrocatalytic processes. This perspective article critically assesses AI-driven modeling and computational approaches that are currently applied to those objects. An application-driven materials intelligence platform is introduced, and its functionalities are scrutinized considering the development of electrocatalyst materials for CO",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in general cognitive ability (i.e., intelligence) have been linked to individual variations in the modular organization of functional brain networks. However, these analyses have been limited to static (time-averaged) connectivity, and have not yet addressed whether dynamic changes in the configuration of brain networks relate to general intelligence. Here, we used multiband functional MRI resting-state data (N\u2009=\u2009281) and estimated subject-specific time-varying functional connectivity networks. Modularity optimization was applied to determine individual time-variant module partitions and to assess fluctuations in modularity across time. We show that higher intelligence, indexed by an established composite measure, the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), is associated with higher temporal stability (lower temporal variability) of brain network modularity. Post-hoc analyses reveal that subjects with higher intelligence scores engage in fewer periods of extremely high modularity - which are characterized by greater disconnection of task-positive from task-negative networks. Further, we show that brain regions of the dorsal attention network contribute most to the observed effect. In sum, our study suggests that investigating the temporal dynamics of functional brain network topology contributes to our understanding of the neural bases of general cognitive abilities.",

    "abstract": "This is a condensed summary of an international multisociety statement on ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology produced by the ACR, European Society of Radiology, RSNA, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine, European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics, Canadian Association of Radiologists, and American Association of Physicists in Medicine. AI has great potential to increase efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but it also carries inherent pitfalls and biases. Widespread use of AI-based intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of systemic errors with high consequence and highlights complex ethical and societal issues. Currently, there is little experience using AI for patient care in diverse clinical settings. Extensive research is needed to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice. This statement highlights our consensus that ethical use of AI in radiology should promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner. We believe AI should respect human rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy. It should be designed for maximum transparency and dependability. Ultimate responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human designers and operators for the foreseeable future. The radiology community should start now to develop codes of ethics and practice for AI that promote any use that helps patients and the common good and should block use of radiology data and algorithms for financial gain without those two attributes.",

    "abstract": "This is a condensed summary of an international multisociety statement on ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology produced by the ACR, European Society of Radiology, RSNA, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine, European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics, Canadian Association of Radiologists, and American Association of Physicists in Medicine. AI has great potential to increase efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but it also carries inherent pitfalls and biases. Widespread use of AI-based intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of systemic errors with high consequence and highlights complex ethical and societal issues. Currently, there is little experience using AI for patient care in diverse clinical settings. Extensive research is needed to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice. This statement highlights our consensus that ethical use of AI in radiology should promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner. We believe AI should respect human rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy. It should be designed for maximum transparency and dependability. Ultimate responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human designers and operators for the foreseeable future. The radiology community should start now to develop codes of ethics and practice for AI that promote any use that helps patients and the common good and should block use of radiology data and algorithms for financial gain without those two attributes.",

    "abstract": "Current semen analysis still commonly depends on a manual microscopy method in clinical laboratories worldwide. However, some of the major disadvantages of this technique are that it is labour-intensive, subjective, laboratory-based and time-consuming. Although computer-assisted semen analysers (CASAs) have enabled partial automation of routine semen analysis, they lack wider acceptance due to their complicated operation. Therefore, the development of an accessible, rapid and standardised method for semen analysis is urgently needed. Here, we describe the development and clinical testing of a novel, automated, artificial intelligence optical microscopic (AIOM)-based technology, LensHooke\u2122 X1 PRO (X1 PRO), designed for the quantitative measurement of sperm concentration, motility and seminal pH. We observed high degree of correlation in the results of concentration, progressive motility and progressively motile sperm concentration between the X1 PRO semen analyser and manual method using 135 clinical semen samples. In addition, the seminal pH results obtained by X1 PRO and manual methods were comparable (p\u00a0=\u00a0.12). In summary, our results showed that new X1 PRO semen analyser is a reliable diagnostic tool for routine semen analysis providing clinically acceptable results based on World Health Organization (WHO) 5th Edition guidelines.",

    "abstract": "In laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), achievement of the Critical View of Safety (CVS) is commonly advocated to prevent bile duct injuries (BDI). However, BDI rates remain stable, probably due to inconsistent application or a poor understanding of CVS as well as unreliable reporting. Objective video reporting could serve for quality auditing and help generate consistent datasets for deep learning models aimed at intraoperative assistance. In this study, we develop and test a method to report CVS using videos.\nLC videos performed at our institution were retrieved and the video segments starting 60\u00a0s prior to the division of cystic structures were edited. Two independent reviewers assessed CVS using an adaptation of the doublet view 6-point scale and a novel binary method in which each criterion is considered either achieved or not. Feasibility to assess CVS in the edited video clips and inter-rater agreements were evaluated.\nCVS was attempted in 78 out of the 100 LC videos retrieved. CVS was assessable in 100% of the 60-s video clips. After mediation, CVS was achieved in 32/78(41.03%). Kappa scores of inter-rater agreements using the doublet view versus the binary assessment were as follows: 0.54 versus 0.75 for CVS achievement, 0.45 versus 0.62 for the dissection of the hepatocystic triangle, 0.36 versus 0.77 for the exposure of the lower part of the cystic plate, and 0.48 versus 0.79 for the 2 structures connected to the gallbladder.\nThe present study is the first to formalize a reproducible method for objective video reporting of CVS in LC. Minute-long video clips provide information on CVS and binary assessment yields a higher inter-rater agreement than previously used methods. These results offer an easy-to-implement strategy for objective video reporting of CVS, which could be used for quality auditing, scientific communication, and development of deep learning models for intraoperative guidance.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) affects up to 4% of a pediatric population, with many comorbidities in the medium-long term. Functional alterations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may explain why OSAS impacts aspects such as executive functions, memory, motor control, attention, visual-spatial skills, learning, and mood regulation. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a complex neuropsychological function that could be impaired in many clinical conditions.\nThe aim of the study is to evaluate the difference in emotional intelligence skills among children with OSAS and healthy subjects (nOSAS).\n129 children (72 males; mean age 7.64 \u00b1 1.98 years) affected by OSAS were compared to 264 non-OSAS (nOSAS) children (138 males; mean age 7.98 \u00b1 2.13) similar for gender, age, and socioeconomic status. In order to assess the emotional quotient, the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory: Youth Version (EQ-i:YV) was used.\nThe comparison for means and standard deviation between OSAS children and nOSAS children for EQ-i:YV scores showed significant differences for Interpersonal, Adaptability, and Stress Management scales and EQ Total score.\nOur findings highlighted the role of intermittent hypoxia in the genesis of the effects of sleep-related respiratory disorders, which involves also aspects different from physical impairments.",

    "abstract": "The industry has adopted Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium standards for clinical trial data and the Food and Drug Administration electronic common technical document standard for documents for many years but still faces many challenges. The solutions based on these standards enable integration among solo systems, but the integration needs to be based on business requirements and provides the end-to-end intelligence for the business. The more standards are adopted, the more meaningful and timely metadata are needed to manage the change of the standards and need to be applied in the process. Automation that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning will be the next game changer in the industry to provide data with higher quality and more efficiency. This article discusses the challenges in managing standards adoption, potential approaches for automation through using robotic processes, artificial intelligence, and the maturity model for metadata-driven automation in clinical research.",

Although this technology can provide opportunities in diagnosis and treatment processes, there still may be challenges and pitfalls related to various safety concerns. To shed light on such opportunities and challenges, this article reviews AI in health care along with its implication for safety. To provide safer technology through AI, this study shows that safe design, safety reserves, safe fail, and procedural safeguards are key strategies, whereas cost, risk, and uncertainty should be identified for all potential technical systems. It is also suggested that clear guidance and protocols should be identified and shared with all stakeholders to develop and adopt safer AI applications in the health care context.",

    "abstract": "AI is providing a significant basis for future technological innovation. The financial sector will be transformed by AI, offering the opportunity for better and more tailor-made services, cost reduction, and the development of new business models. The Federal and the Hessen governments recently published roadmaps for the further development of AI in Germany and Hessen, respectively. The Federal Government will invest three billion euros over the next 5 years in a variety of research and business sectors whereas the State of Hessen will set up a new AI-oriented institute of applied research and business development and spend one billion euros over the next 5 years on digitalization development. The public strategies for building AI hubs are still extremely diverse. However, the focus is on stronger application of research results in business activities, on increasing networks and ecosystems and predominantly on building on existing centers of excellence. The Frankfurt Rhein Main Region, already a strong hub for fintech, cyber security, and AI, will especially benefit from these programs. The financial center Frankfurt offers a vivid and fast growing tech and start up community a well as an academic and data infrastructure unprecedented in Europe: the largest data and cloud service hub in continental Europe, the worlds largest internet knot, universities, research institutes with global quality research in AI, as well as companies and consultancies specialized in AI and neighboring areas such as fintech and cyber security.",

    "abstract": "Machine intelligence has been greatly developed in the past decades and has been widely used in many fields. In the recent years, many reports have shown its satisfactory effect in drug discovery. In this study, machine intelligence methods were explored to assist the cell activity prediction. Multiple machine intelligence methods including support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting machine, convolutional neural network, long short-term memory network, and gated recurrent unit network were employed to separate compounds based on their cell activity. Different from some reported classification models, compounds were expressed as a string by the simplified molecular input line entry system and directly used as input rather than any chemical descriptors, which mimicked natural language processing. Both the single cell strain and whole data set under the balanced and imbalanced data distributions were discussed, respectively. Different activity cutoffs were set for the single (",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is not intelligent in the human meaning-AI works on the basis of algorithms created by humans and the results of AI are based on real-world data. AI is regulated by all legal frameworks that also apply in other scenarios, in particular data protection law and medical device law. AI delivers results that are as good as the database that formed the learning content of the AI enables. If, for example, the data on which the AI is based contain discrimination, this discrimination is \"learned\" by the AI; since the AI does not really think, the AI cannot reflect its own results either-it can only make a\u00a0comparison within the parameters of the specifications by the software developers. If AI is used, the question of the algorithms implemented and the database on which the decision is based must therefore be clarified beforehand and a\u00a0check must be carried out based on this to determine whether the AI is suitable for use. Due to the missing possibility of real human thinking, AI cannot replace physicians, but can assist them in their daily work.",

    "abstract": "Robotic therapy is a useful method applied during rehabilitation of stroke patients (to regain motor functions). To ensure active participation of the patient, assistance-as-needed is provided during robotic training. However, most existing studies are based on a predetermined desired trajectory, which significantly limits the use of this method for more complex scenarios. In this paper, artificial intelligence (AI) agents are introduced to enhance the robot so that a knee exoskeleton can be autonomously controlled. A new assist-as-needed (AAN) method is proposed, where the subjects and agents cooperatively control movements. An electromyographic (EMG)-controlled knee exoskeleton with an interesting screen game is developed. Two different AI agents, modular pipeline and deep Q-network, are introduced; both can control the exoskeleton to play the screen game independently. The human-robot cooperative control is studied with two different assistant strategies, i.e., fixed assistant ratio and AAN. Eight healthy subjects participated in the initial experiment, and four assistant modes were studied. The game scores obtained by the two agents were significantly higher than those obtained by healthy subjects (EMG control), indicating that using the agents to assist stroke rehabilitation is possible. The AAN method demonstrated a better performance than the fixed assistant ratio method, indicated by the higher integral muscle activation level and participant score. Compared to a fully active control (EMG control) and fully fixed guidance (AI control), human-robot cooperative control had significantly higher integral muscle activation levels, i.e., the subjects were more involved and motivated during training. Using AI agents to power rehabilitation robots is a promising way to realize AAN rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based therapeutics, devices, and systems are vital innovations in cancer control; particularly, they allow for diagnosis, screening, precise estimation of survival, informing therapy selection, and scaling up treatment services in a timely manner.\nThe aim of this study was to analyze the global trends, patterns, and development of interdisciplinary landscapes in AI and cancer research.\nAn exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify research domains emerging from abstract contents. The Jaccard similarity index was utilized to identify the most frequently co-occurring terms. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used for classifying papers into corresponding topics.\nFrom 1991 to 2018, the number of studies examining the application of AI in cancer care has grown to 3555 papers covering therapeutics, capacities, and factors associated with outcomes. Topics with the highest volume of publications include (1) machine learning, (2) comparative effectiveness evaluation of AI-assisted medical therapies, and (3) AI-based prediction. Noticeably, this classification has revealed topics examining the incremental effectiveness of AI applications, the quality of life, and functioning of patients receiving these innovations. The growing research productivity and expansion of multidisciplinary approaches are largely driven by machine learning, artificial neural networks, and AI in various clinical practices.\nThe research landscapes show that the development of AI in cancer care is focused on not only improving prediction in cancer screening and AI-assisted therapeutics but also on improving other corresponding areas such as precision and personalized medicine and patient-reported outcomes.",

Topics with the highest volume of publications include (1) machine learning, (2) comparative effectiveness evaluation of AI-assisted medical therapies, and (3) AI-based prediction. Noticeably, this classification has revealed topics examining the incremental effectiveness of AI applications, the quality of life, and functioning of patients receiving these innovations. The growing research productivity and expansion of multidisciplinary approaches are largely driven by machine learning, artificial neural networks, and AI in various clinical practices.",

    "abstract": "This is a condensed summary of an international multisociety statement on ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology produced by the ACR, European Society of Radiology, RSNA, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine, European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics, Canadian Association of Radiologists, and American Association of Physicists in Medicine. AI has great potential to increase efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but it also carries inherent pitfalls and biases. Widespread use of AI-based intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of systemic errors with high consequence and highlights complex ethical and societal issues. Currently, there is little experience using AI for patient care in diverse clinical settings. Extensive research is needed to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice. This statement highlights our consensus that ethical use of AI in radiology should promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner. We believe AI should respect human rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy. It should be designed for maximum transparency and dependability. Ultimate responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human designers and operators for the foreseeable future. The radiology community should start now to develop codes of ethics and practice for AI that promote any use that helps patients and the common good and should block use of radiology data and algorithms for financial gain without those two attributes.

    "abstract": "The dropout rate of Chinese elementary school students after 2007 rose again. Little research to date has identified individual differences in pathways of academic engagement to discern those at risk of disengagement and dropout from schools, as well as the longitudinal linkages between cognitive beliefs with academic engagement.\nExamine the developmental trajectories of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural engagement, and assess relations between the implicit theory of intelligence and academic self-efficacy and the development of academic engagement.\nWe recruited 532, 450, and 415 elementary students to rate on self-report scales in April 2016 (T1), October 2016 (T2), and April 2017 (T3), respectively. Trajectories of academic engagement were analysed by using a multiple-process growth mixture model, and levels of entity theory of intelligence and academic self-efficacy between engagement groups were compared by using analysis of variance.\nWe categorized the students into four groups: persistent (71.24%), climbing (6.01%), descending (16.54%), and struggling engagement (6.20%) groups. Within each group, the levels of academic self-efficacy from T1 to T3 demonstrated a consistent trend with the engagement trajectory; the levels of the implicit theory of intelligence over time showed the reverse trend.\nAttention should be given more on the students from the descending and struggling groups. The implicit theory of intelligence and academic self-efficacy showed different longitudinal associations with engagement trajectories.",

    "abstract": "This is a condensed summary of an international multisociety statement on ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology produced by the ACR, European Society of Radiology, RSNA, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine, European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics, Canadian Association of Radiologists, and American Association of Physicists in Medicine.AI has great potential to increase efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but also carries inherent pitfalls and biases. Widespread use of AI-based intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of systemic errors with high consequence, and highlights complex ethical and societal issues. Currently, there is little experience using AI for patient care in diverse clinical settings. Extensive research is needed to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice.This statement highlights our consensus that ethical use of AI in radiology should promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner. We believe AI should respect human rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy. It should be designed for maximum transparency and dependability. Ultimate responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human designers and operators for the foreseeable future.The radiology community should start now to develop codes of ethics and practice for AI which promote any use that helps patients and the common good and should block use of radiology data and algorithms for financial gain without those two attributes.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine the lowest cut-off value for albuminuria levels, which can be used to detect diabetic kidney disease (DKD) using the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data for US adults were used, and participants were classified as having diabetes or prediabetes based on a self-report and physiological measures. The study dataset comprised 942 diabetes and 524 prediabetes samples. This study clarified the significance of the lower albuminuria (UACR) levels, which can detect DKD, using an artificial intelligence-based rule extraction approach. The diagnostic rules (15 concrete rules) for both samples were extracted using a recursive-rule eXtraction (Re-RX) algorithm with continuous attributes (continuous Re-RX) to discriminate between prediabetes and diabetes datasets. Continuous Re-RX showed high test accuracy (77.56%) and a large area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (75%), which derived the two cut-off values (6.1 mg/g Cr and 71.00 mg/g Cr) for the lower albuminuria level in the UACR to detect early development of DKD. The early cut-off values for normoalbuminuria (NA) and microalbuminuria (MA) will be determined to help detect CKD and DKD, and to detect diabetes before MA develop and to prevent diabetic complications.",

For example, a staggering six in 10 adults in the USA are currently suffering from a chronic disease (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2019). Unfortunately, chronic conditions are not treatable overnight, but they can often be improved by regular incorporation of preventative behaviours (e.g., taking medication, healthy sleeping habits, being physically active, healthy eating, etc.). However, due to the many contingencies that arise in our lives, regular incorporation of healthy behaviours is difficult, and often when we need help in enacting these behaviours, support from clinical professionals is not available.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into our digital healthcare system is seen as a significant strategy to contain Australia's rising healthcare costs, support clinical decision making, manage chronic disease burden and support our ageing population. With the increasing roll-out of 'digital hospitals', electronic medical records, new data capture and analysis technologies, as well as a digitally enabled health consumer, the Australian healthcare workforce is required to become digitally literate to manage the significant changes in the healthcare landscape. To ensure that new innovations such as AI are inclusive of clinicians, an understanding of how the technology will impact the healthcare professions is imperative.\nIn order to explore the complex phenomenon of healthcare professionals' understanding and experiences of AI use in the delivery of healthcare, an integrative review inclusive of quantitative and qualitative studies was undertaken in June 2018.\nOne study met all inclusion criteria. This study was an observational study which used a questionnaire to measure healthcare professional's intrinsic motivation in adoption behaviour when using an artificially intelligent medical diagnosis support system (AIMDSS).\nThe study found that healthcare professionals were less likely to use AI in the delivery of healthcare if they did not trust the technology or understand how it was used to improve patient outcomes or the delivery of care which is specific to the healthcare setting. The perception that AI would replace them in the healthcare setting was not evident. This may be due to the fact that AI is not yet at the forefront of technology use in healthcare setting. More research is needed to examine the experiences and perceptions of healthcare professionals using AI in the delivery of healthcare.",

    "abstract": "This study developed a neural network to perform automated pressure waveform analysis and allow real-time accurate identification of damping.\nDamping of aortic pressure during coronary angiography must be identified to avoid serious complications and make accurate coronary physiology measurements. There are currently no automated methods to do this, and so identification of damping requires constant monitoring, which is prone to human error.\nThe neural network was trained and tested versus core laboratory expert opinions derived from 2 separate datasets. A total of 5,709 aortic pressure waveforms of individual heart beats were extracted and classified. The study developed a recurrent convolutional neural network to classify beats as either normal, showing damping, or artifactual. Accuracies were reported using the opinions of 2 independent core laboratories.\nThe neural network was 99.4% accurate (95% confidence interval: 98.8% to 99.6%) at classifying beats from the testing dataset when judged against the opinions of the internal core laboratory. It was 98.7% accurate (95%\u00a0confidence interval: 98.0% to 99.2%) when judged against the opinions of an external core laboratory not involved in neural network training. The neural network was 100% sensitive, with no beats classified as damped misclassified, with a specificity of 99.8%. The positive predictive and negative predictive values were 98.1% and 99.5%. The 2 core laboratories agreed more closely with the neural network than with each other.\nArterial waveform analysis using neural networks allows rapid and accurate identification of damping. This demonstrates how machine learning can assist with patient safety and the quality control of procedures.",

    "abstract": "Thrombosis development in either arterial or venous system remains a major cause of death and disability worldwide. This poorly controlled in vivo clotting could result in many severe complications including myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, stroke, and cerebral venous thrombosis, to name a few. These conditions are collectively known as thromboembolic disorders (TEDs). Appropriate understanding of TEDs is challenging, as they are multifactorial and involve several and often different risk factors. Hence, it requires a collective effort and data from numerous research studies to fully comprehend molecular mechanisms for prediction, prevention, treatment, and overall management of these conditions. To accomplish this arduous feat, a comprehensive approach is required that can compile thousands of available experimental data and transform these into more applicable and purposeful findings. Thus, large datasets could be utilized to generate models that could be predictive of how an individual would respond when subjected to any kind of additional risk factors or surgery, hospitalization, etc., or in the presence of some susceptible genetic variations. Artificial intelligence-based methods harness the capabilities of computer software to imitate human behaviors such as language translation, visual perception, and, most importantly, decision making. These emerging tools, if appropriately explored, might assist in processing of large data and tackle the complexities of identifying novel or interesting pathways that could otherwise be hidden due to their enormity. This narrative review attempts to compile the applications of various subfields of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the context of thrombosis research to date. It further reflects on the potential of artificial intelligence in transforming enormous research data into translational application in the form of predictive computational models.",

    "abstract": "In vitro assays and simulation technologies are powerful methodologies that can inform scientists of nanomaterial (NM) distribution and fate in humans or pre-clinical species. For small molecules, less animal data is often needed because there are a multitude of in vitro screening tools and simulation-based approaches to quantify uptake and deliver data that makes extrapolation to in vivo studies feasible. Small molecule simulations work because these materials often diffuse quickly and partition after reaching equilibrium shortly after dosing, but this cannot be applied to NMs. NMs interact with cells through energy dependent pathways, often taking hours or days to become fully internalized within the cellular environment. In vitro screening tools must capture these phenomena so that cell simulations built on mechanism-based models can deliver relationships between exposure dose and mechanistic biology, that is biology representative of fundamental processes involved in NM transport by cells (e.g. membrane adsorption and subsequent internalization). Here, we developed, validated, and applied the FORECAST method, a combination of a calibrated fluorescence assay (CF) with an artificial intelligence-based cell simulation to quantify rates descriptive of the time-dependent mechanistic biological interactions between NMs and individual cells. This work is expected to provide a means of extrapolation to pre-clinical or human biodistribution with cellular level resolution for NMs starting only from in vitro data.",

    "abstract": "Despite enormous progress in machine learning, artificial neural networks still lag behind brains in their ability to generalize to new situations. Given identical training data, differences in generalization are caused by many defining features of a learning algorithm, such as network architecture and learning rule. Their joint effect, called \"inductive bias,\" determines how well any learning algorithm-or brain-generalizes: robust generalization needs good inductive biases. Artificial networks use rather nonspecific biases and often latch onto patterns that are only informative about the statistics of the training data but may not generalize to different scenarios. Brains, on the other hand, generalize across comparatively drastic changes in the sensory input all the time. We highlight some shortcomings of state-of-the-art learning algorithms compared to biological brains and discuss several ideas about how neuroscience can guide the quest for better inductive biases by providing useful constraints on representations and network architecture.",

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the major causes for emergency surgery in childhood and adolescence. Appendectomy is still the therapy of choice, but conservative strategies are increasingly being studied for uncomplicated inflammation. Diagnosis of acute appendicitis remains challenging, especially due to the frequently unspecific clinical picture. Inflammatory blood markers and imaging methods like ultrasound are limited as they have to be interpreted by experts and still do not offer sufficient diagnostic certainty. This study presents a method for automatic diagnosis of appendicitis as well as the differentiation between complicated and uncomplicated inflammation using values/parameters which are routinely and unbiasedly obtained for each patient with suspected appendicitis. We analyzed full blood counts, c-reactive protein (CRP) and appendiceal diameters in ultrasound investigations corresponding to children and adolescents aged 0-17 years from a hospital based population in Berlin, Germany. A total of 590 patients (473 patients with appendicitis in histopathology and 117 with negative histopathological findings) were analyzed retrospectively with modern algorithms from machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). The discovery of informative parameters (biomarker signatures) and training of the classification model were done with a maximum of 35% of the patients. The remaining minimum 65% of patients were used for validation. At clinical relevant cut-off points the accuracy of the biomarker signature for diagnosis of appendicitis was 90% (93% sensitivity, 67% specificity), while the accuracy to correctly identify complicated inflammation was 51% (95% sensitivity, 33% specificity) on validation data. Such a test would be capable to prevent two out of three patients without appendicitis from useless surgery as well as one out of three patients with uncomplicated appendicitis. The presented method has the potential to change today's therapeutic approach for appendicitis and demonstrates the capability of algorithms from AI and ML to significantly improve diagnostics even based on routine diagnostic parameters.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning techniques will change healthcare as we know it. While healthcare AI applications are currently trailing behind popular AI applications, such as personalized web-based advertising, the pace of research and deployment is picking up and about to become disruptive. Overcoming challenges such as patient and public support, transparency over the legal basis for healthcare data use, privacy preservation, technical challenges related to accessing large-scale data from healthcare systems not designed for Big Data analysis, and deployment of AI in routine clinical practice will be crucial. Cardiac imaging and imaging of other body parts is likely to be at the frontier for the development of applications as pattern recognition and machine learning are a significant strength of AI with practical links to image processing. Many opportunities in cardiac imaging exist where AI will impact patients, medical staff, hospitals, commissioners and thus, the entire healthcare system. This perspective article will outline our vision for AI in cardiac imaging with examples of potential applications, challenges and some lessons learnt in recent years.",

    "abstract": "No study has investigated the association between intelligence quotient (IQ) and disability (i.e., difficulties in activities of daily living [ADL] or instrumental activities of daily living [IADL]) in the general population.\nThe goal of this nationally representative study was to analyse the potential IQ-disability association in England and identify influential factors in this association.\nCross-sectional data were analyzed from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (n=6872). IQ was assessed by using the National Adult Reading Test, which consists of a list of 50 words and is scored by counting the number of errors in reading the words aloud. Disability was defined as difficulties in at least 1 of the 7 domains of ADL and IADL. Regression and mediation analyses were conducted to analyze the association between IQ and disability and identify potential factors involved in this relationship, estimating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nAmong the 6872 participants, the mean (SD) age was 46.9 (18.9) years; 51.8% were women. The prevalence of disability increased from 27.7% with IQ 120-129 to 51.0% with IQ 70-79. After adjusting for sex, age and ethnicity, as compared with IQ 120-129, with IQ 110-119, 100-109, 90-99, 80-89, and 70-79, the probability of disability was increased (OR 1.22 [95% CI 1.01-1.48], 1.42 [1.16-1.72], 1.86 [1.54-2.25], 2.41 [1.92-3.03], and 4.71 [3.56-6.17], respectively). In addition, we found a positive association between a 1-SD decrease in IQ and disability (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.43-1.63). Finally, income (mediated percentage 26.9%), social class (18.0%) and education (11.6%) strongly affected the IQ-disability association, and these socioeconomic factors collectively explained 37.1% of the association.\nLow IQ was positively associated with disability in England, and socioeconomic status explained more than one-third of this relationship.",

    "abstract": "Although computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is widely used in mammography, conventional CAD programs that use prompts to indicate potential cancers on the mammograms have not led to an improvement in diagnostic accuracy. Because of the advances in machine learning, especially with use of deep (multilayered) convolutional neural networks, artificial intelligence has undergone a transformation that has improved the quality of the predictions of the models. Recently, such deep learning algorithms have been applied to mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). In this review, the authors explain how deep learning works in the context of mammography and DBT and define the important technical challenges. Subsequently, they discuss the current status and future perspectives of artificial intelligence-based clinical applications for mammography, DBT, and radiomics. Available algorithms are advanced and approach the performance of radiologists-especially for cancer detection and risk prediction at mammography. However, clinical validation is largely lacking, and it is not clear how the power of deep learning should be used to optimize practice. Further development of deep learning models is necessary for DBT, and this requires collection of larger databases. It is expected that deep learning will eventually have an important role in DBT, including the generation of synthetic images.",

    "abstract": "The problem of air pollution is a persistent issue for mankind and becoming increasingly serious in recent years, which has drawn worldwide attention. Establishing a scientific and effective air quality early-warning system is really significant and important. Regretfully, previous research didn't thoroughly explore not only air pollutant prediction but also air quality evaluation, and relevant research work is still scarce, especially in China. Therefore, a novel air quality early-warning system composed of prediction and evaluation was developed in this study. Firstly, the advanced data preprocessing technology Improved Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (ICEEMDAN) combined with the powerful swarm intelligence algorithm Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the efficient artificial neural network Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) formed the prediction model. Then the predictive results were further analyzed by the method of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, which offered intuitive air quality information and corresponding measures. The proposed system was tested in the Jing-Jin-Ji region of China, a representative research area in the world, and the daily concentration data of six main air pollutants in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang for two years were used to validate the accuracy and efficiency. The results show that the prediction model is superior to other benchmark models in pollutant concentration prediction and the evaluation model is satisfactory in air quality level reporting compared with the actual status. Therefore, the proposed system is believed to play an important role in air pollution control and smart city construction all over the world in the future.",

    "abstract": "Ambient intelligence is a new paradigm in the Internet of Things (IoT) world that brings smartness to living environments to make them more sensitive; adaptive; and personalized to human needs. A critical area where ambient intelligence can be used is health and social care; where it can improve and sustain the quality of life without increasing financial costs. The adoption of this new paradigm for health and social care largely depends on the technology deployed (sensors and wireless networks), the software used for decision-making and the security, privacy and reliability of the information. IoT sensors and wearables collect sensitive data and must respond in a near real-time manner to input changes. An IoT security framework is meant to offer the versatility and modularization needed to sustain such applications. Our framework was designed to easily integrate with different health and social care applications, separating security tasks from functional ones and being designed with independent modules for each layer (Cloud, gateway and IoT device), that offer functionalities relative to that layer.",

    "abstract": "To heal otherwise in oncology has become an imperative of Public Health and an economic imperative in France. Patients can therefore receive live most of their care outside of hospital with more ambulatory care. This ambulatory shift will benefit from the digital revolution and the development of digital health or e-health. Cancer research will also benefit with Big Data and artificial intelligence, which gather and analyze a huge amount of data. In this synthesis, we describe the different e-health tools and their potential impacts in oncology, at the levels of education and information of patients and caregivers, prevention, screening and diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, and research. A few randomized studies have already demonstrated clinical benefits. Large Big Data projects such as ConSoRe and Health Data Hub have been launched in France. We also discuss the issues and limitations of \"cancer outside the hospital walls and e-health\" from the point of view of patients, health care professionals, health facilities and government. This new organization will have to provide remote support \"outside the walls\" with care and follow-up of quality, continuous and prolonged in total safety and equity. Ongoing and future randomized clinical trials will need to definitively demonstrate areas of interest, advantages and drawbacks not only for patients, but also for caregivers, health facilities and governments.",

    "abstract": "EGD is the most vital procedure for the diagnosis of upper GI lesions. We aimed to compare the performance of unsedated ultrathin transoral endoscopy (U-TOE), unsedated conventional EGD (C-EGD), and sedated C-EGD with or without the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) system.\nIn this prospective, single-blind, 3-parallel-group, randomized, single-center trial, 437 patients scheduled to undergo outpatient EGD were randomized to unsedated U-TOE, unsedated C-EGD, or sedated C-EGD, and each group was then divided into 2 subgroups: with or without the assistance of an AI system to monitor blind spots during EGD. The primary outcome was the blind spot rate of these 3 groups with the assistance of AI. The secondary outcomes were to compare blind spot rates of unsedated U-TOE, unsedated, and sedated C-EGD with or without the assistance of AI, respectively, and the concordance between AI and the endoscopists' review.\nThe blind spot rate with AI-assisted sedated C-EGD was significantly lower than that of unsedated U-TOE and unsedated C-EGD (3.42% vs 21.77% vs 31.23%, respectively; P\u00a0< .05). The blind spot rate of the AI subgroup was lower than that of the control subgroup in all 3 groups (sedated C-EGD: 3.42% vs 22.46%, P\u00a0< .001; unsedated U-TOE: 21.77% vs 29.92%, P\u00a0< .001; unsedated C-EGD: 31.23% vs 42.46%, P\u00a0< .001).\nThe blind spot rate of sedated C-EGD was the lowest among the 3 types of EGD, and the addition of AI had a maximal effect on sedated C-EGD.
