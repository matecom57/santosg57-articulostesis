    "abstract": "To investigate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) reading digital mammograms in increasing the chance of detecting missed breast cancer, by studying the AI- flagged early morphology indictors, overlooked by the radiologist, and correlating them with the missed cancer pathology types.\nMammograms done in 2020-2023, presenting breast carcinomas (n\u202f=\u202f1998), were analyzed in concordance with the prior one year's result (2019-2022) assumed negative or benign. Present mammograms reviewed for the descriptors: asymmetry, distortion, mass, and microcalcifications. The AI presented abnormalities by overlaying color hue and scoring percentage for the degree of suspicion of malignancy.\nPrior mammogram with AI marking compromised 54\u202f% (n\u202f=\u202f555), and in the present mammograms, AI targeted 904 (88\u202f%) carcinomas. The descriptor proportion of \"asymmetry\" was the common presentation of missed breast carcinoma (64.1\u202f%) in the prior mammograms and the highest detection rate for AI was presented by \"distortion\" (100\u202f%) followed by \"grouped microcalcifications\" (80\u202f%). AI performance to predict malignancy in previously assigned negative or benign mammograms showed sensitivity of 73.4\u202f%, specificity of 89\u202f%, and accuracy of 78.4\u202f%.\nReading mammograms with AI significantly enhances the detection of early cancerous changes, particularly in dense breast tissues. The AI's detection rate does not correlate with specific pathological types of breast cancer, highlighting its broad utility. Subtle mammographic changes in postmenopausal women, not corroborated by ultrasound but marked by AI, warrant further evaluation by advanced applications of digital mammograms and close interval AI-reading mammogram follow up to minimize the potential for missed breast carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Surgeon fatigue significantly affects cognitive and motor functions, increasing the risk of errors and adverse patient outcomes. Traditional fatigue management methods, such as structured breaks and duty-hour limits, are insufficient for real-time fatigue detection in high-stakes surgeries. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), there is growing potential for AI-driven technologies to address this issue through continuous monitoring and adaptive interventions. This paper explores how AI, via machine learning algorithms, wearable devices, and real-time feedback systems, enables comprehensive fatigue detection by analysing physiological, behavioural, and environmental data. Techniques such as heart rate variability analysis, electroencephalogram monitoring, and computer vision-based behavioural analysis are examined, as well as predictive models that provide proactive solutions. These AI-driven systems could suggest personalized break schedules, task redistribution, and interface adaptations in response to real-time fatigue indicators, potentially enhancing surgical safety and precision. However, ethical challenges, including data privacy and surgeon autonomy, must be carefully navigated to foster acceptance and integration within clinical settings. This review highlights AI's transformative potential in optimizing fatigue management and improving overall outcomes in the operating room\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.",

    "abstract": "The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to permeate most industries, including medicine, and patients will inevitably start using these large language model (LLM) chatbots as a modality for education. As healthcare information technology evolves, it is imperative to evaluate chatbots and the accuracy of the information they provide to patients and to determine if there is variability between them.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and comprehensiveness of three chatbots in addressing questions related to endometriosis and determine the level of variability between them.\nThree LLMs, including Chat GPT-4 (Open AI), Claude (Anthropic), and Bard (Google) were asked to generate answers to 10 commonly asked questions about endometriosis. The responses were qualitatively compared to current guidelines and expert opinion on endometriosis and rated on a scale by nine gynecologists. The grading scale included the following: (1) Completely incorrect, (2) mostly incorrect and some correct, (3) mostly correct and some incorrect, (4) correct but inadequate, (5) correct and comprehensive. Final scores were averaged between the nine reviewers. Kendall's \nAverage scores for the 10 answers amongst Bard, Chat GPT, and Claude were 3.69, 4.24, and 3.7, respectively. Two questions showed significant disagreement between the nine reviewers. There were no questions the models could answer comprehensively or correctly across the reviewers. The model most associated with comprehensive and correct responses was ChatGPT. Chatbots showed an improved ability to accurately answer questions about symptoms and pathophysiology over treatment and risk of recurrence.\nThe analysis of LLMs revealed that, on average, they mainly provided correct but inadequate responses to commonly asked patient questions about endometriosis. While chatbot responses can serve as valuable supplements to information provided by licensed medical professionals, it is crucial to maintain a thorough ongoing evaluation process for outputs to provide the most comprehensive and accurate information to patients. Further research into this technology and its role in patient education and treatment is crucial as generative AI becomes more embedded in the medical field.",

    "abstract": "Journals and publishers are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to screen submissions for potential misconduct, including plagiarism and data or image manipulation. While using AI can enhance the integrity of published manuscripts, it can also increase the risk of false/unsubstantiated allegations. Ambiguities related to journals' and publishers' responsibilities concerning fairness and transparency also raise ethical concerns. In this Topic Piece, we offer the following guidance: (1) All cases of suspected misconduct identified by AI tools should be carefully reviewed by humans to verify accuracy and ensure accountability; (2) Journals/publishers that use AI tools to detect misconduct should use only well-tested and reliable tools, remain vigilant concerning forms of misconduct that cannot be detected by these tools, and stay abreast of advancements in technology; (3) Journals/publishers should inform authors about irregularities identified by AI tools and give them a chance to respond before forwarding allegations to their institutions in accordance with Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines; (4) Journals/publishers that use AI tools to detect misconduct should screen all relevant submissions and not just random/purposefully selected submissions; and (5) Journals should inform authors about their definition of misconduct, their use of AI tools to detect misconduct, and their policies and procedures for responding to suspected cases of misconduct.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to evaluate the specific performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for lung nodule detection in chest radiography for a larger number of nodules of different sizes and densities using a standardized phantom approach. A total of 450 nodules with varying density (d1 to d3) and size (3, 5, 8, 10 and 12\u2009mm) were inserted in a Lungman phantom at various locations. Radiographic images with varying projections were acquired and processed using the AI algorithm for nodule detection. Computed tomography (CT) was performed for correlation. Ground truth (detectability) was established through a human consensus reading. Overall sensitivity and specificity of 0.978 and 0.812, respectively, were achieved for nodule detection. The false-positive rate was low with an overall rate of 0.19. The overall accuracy was calculated as 0.84 for all nodules. While most studies evaluating AI performance in the detection of pulmonary nodules have evaluated a mix of varying nodules, these are the first results of a controlled phantom-based study using a balanced number of nodules of all sizes and densities. To increase the radiologist's diagnostic performance and minimize the risk of decision bias, such algorithms have an obvious benefit in a clinical scenario.",

    "abstract": "In malaria infection, quantifying blood parasitemia is a critical step for evaluating the severity of the disease. This has generally been conducted manually, and thus, its accuracy depends on the expertise of technicians. There is an urgent need for an automated technique to overcome manual errors. The aim of the study is to find an alternative method for counting malaria blood parasitemia.\nThis study evaluated the accuracy of automated counting using QuPath compared to manual counting. GraphPad Kappa evaluated agreement between high and low parasitemia in both counting methods using Cohen's test.\nQuPath was revealed to be a promising method that has fair agreement and no statistically significant differences compared to manual counting.\nIn conclusion, automated quantification is suggested to be a time- and effort-saving technique and, therefore, a worthwhile alternative to manual counting.",

    "abstract": "Optic neuritis (ON) is a complex clinical syndrome that has diverse etiologies and treatments based on its subtypes. Notably, ON associated with multiple sclerosis (MS ON) has a good prognosis for recovery irrespective of treatment, whereas ON associated with other conditions including neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease is often associated with less favorable outcomes. Delay in treatment of these non-MS ON subtypes can lead to irreversible vision loss. It is important to distinguish MS ON from other ON subtypes early, to guide appropriate management. Yet, identifying ON and differentiating subtypes can be challenging as MRI and serological antibody test results are not always readily available in the acute setting. The purpose of this study is to develop a deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to predict subtype based on fundus photographs, to aid the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected ON.\nThis was a retrospective study of patients with ON seen at our institution between 2007 and 2022. Fundus photographs (1,599) were retrospectively collected from a total of 321 patients classified into 2 groups: MS ON (262 patients; 1,114 photographs) and non-MS ON (59 patients; 485 photographs). The dataset was divided into training and holdout test sets with an 80%/20% ratio, using stratified sampling to ensure equal representation of MS ON and non-MS ON patients in both sets. Model hyperparameters were tuned using 5-fold cross-validation on the training dataset. The overall performance and generalizability of the model was subsequently evaluated on the holdout test set.\nThe receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the developed model, evaluated on the holdout test dataset, yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.92). The model attained an accuracy of 76.2% (95% CI, 68.4-83.1), a sensitivity of 74.2% (95% CI, 55.9-87.4) and a specificity of 76.9% (95% CI, 67.6-85.0) in classifying images as non-MS-related ON.\nThis study provides preliminary evidence supporting a role for AI in differentiating non-MS ON subtypes from MS ON. Future work will aim to increase the size of the dataset and explore the role of combining clinical and paraclinical measures to refine deep learning models over time.",

    "abstract": "Extrapancreatic perineural invasion (EPNI) increases the risk of postoperative recurrence in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This study aimed to develop and validate a computed tomography (CT)-based, fully automated preoperative artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict EPNI in patients with PDAC.\nThe authors retrospectively enrolled 1065 patients from two Shanghai hospitals between June 2014 and April 2023. Patients were split into training (n=497), internal validation (n=212), internal test (n=180), and external test (n=176) sets. The AI model used perivascular space and tumor contact for EPNI detection. The authors evaluated the AI model's performance based on its discrimination. Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests, and Cox regression were used for survival analysis.\nThe AI model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance for EPNI with 1-pixel expansion. The area under the curve in the training, validation, internal test, and external test sets were 0.87, 0.88, 0.82, and 0.83, respectively. The log-rank test revealed a significantly longer survival in the AI-predicted EPNI-negative group than the AI-predicted EPNI-positive group in the training, validation, and internal test sets (P<0.05). Moreover, the AI model exhibited exceptional prognostic stratification in early PDAC and improved assessment of neoadjuvant therapy's effectiveness.\nThe AI model presents a robust modality for EPNI diagnosis, risk stratification, and neoadjuvant treatment guidance in PDAC, and can be applied to guide personalized precision therapy.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in many medical specialties. However, nephrology has lagged in adopting and incorporating machine learning techniques. Nephrology is well positioned to capitalize on the benefits of AI. The abundance of structured clinical data, combined with the mathematical nature of this specialty, makes it an attractive option for AI applications. AI can also play a significant role in addressing health inequities, especially in organ transplantation. It has also been used to detect rare diseases such as Fabry disease early. This review article aims to increase awareness on the basic concepts in machine learning and discuss AI applications in nephrology. It also addresses the challenges in integrating AI into clinical practice and the need for creating an AI-competent nephrology workforce. Even though AI will not replace nephrologists, those who are able to incorporate AI into their practice effectively will undoubtedly provide better care to their patients. The integration of AI technology is no longer just an option but a necessity for staying ahead in the field of nephrology. Finally, AI can contribute as a force multiplier in transitioning to a value-based care model.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances of artificial intelligence (AI) in retinal imaging found its application in two major categories: discriminative and generative AI. For discriminative tasks, conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are still major AI techniques. Vision transformers (ViT), inspired by the transformer architecture in natural language processing, has emerged as useful techniques for discriminating retinal images. ViT can attain excellent results when pretrained at sufficient scale and transferred to specific tasks with fewer images, compared to conventional CNN. Many studies found better performance of ViT, compared to CNN, for common tasks such as diabetic retinopathy screening on color fundus photographs (CFP) and segmentation of retinal fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is the main AI technique in generative AI in retinal imaging. Novel images generated by GAN can be applied for training AI models in imbalanced or inadequate datasets. Foundation models are also recent advances in retinal imaging. They are pretrained with huge datasets, such as millions of CFP and OCT images and fine-tuned for downstream tasks with much smaller datasets. A foundation model, RETFound, which was self-supervised and found to discriminate many eye and systemic diseases better than supervised models. Large language models are foundation models that may be applied for text-related tasks, like reports of retinal angiography. Whereas AI technology moves forward fast, real-world use of AI models moves slowly, making the gap between development and deployment even wider. Strong evidence showing AI models can prevent visual loss may be required to close this gap.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) frequently results in persistent motor, sensory, or autonomic dysfunction, and the outcomes are largely determined by the location and severity of the injury. Despite significant technological progress, the intricate nature of the spinal cord anatomy and the difficulties associated with neuroregeneration make full recovery from SCI uncommon. This review explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI), with a particular focus on machine learning, to enhance patient outcomes in SCI management. The application of AI, specifically machine learning, has revolutionized the diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and rehabilitation of patients with SCI. By leveraging large datasets and identifying complex patterns, AI contributes to improved diagnostic accuracy, optimizes surgical procedures, and enables the personalization of therapeutic interventions. AI-driven prognostic models provide accurate predictions of recovery, facilitating improved planning and resource allocation. Additionally, AI-powered rehabilitation systems, including robotic devices and brain-computer interfaces, increase the effectiveness and accessibility of therapy. However, realizing the full potential of AI in SCI care requires ongoing research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the development of comprehensive datasets. As AI continues to evolve, it is expected to play an increasingly vital role in enhancing the outcomes of patients with SCI.",

    "abstract": "General practice/family medicine is a primary healthcare discipline that focuses on providing comprehensive, patient-centered care to individuals and families across their lifespan. This study aimed to assess the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in general practice/family medicine regarding the 12 characteristics of its discipline as described in the recently revised European Definition of General Practice/Family Medicine. AI has the potential to revolutionize family medicine practice by improving the accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness of various clinical tasks. From diagnostic decision-making to chronic condition management and clinical workflow optimization, AI-powered tools offer a range of benefits for patients and clinicians. However, appropriate education and training of the primary healthcare providers are deemed necessary to maximize benefits and minimize potential pitfalls. To ensure efficient and safe integration of AI in medical practice, important implications regarding privacy, malpractice, bias, autonomy, and overtreatment should also be addressed. AI application should be treated as a practical, assistive tool for the clinician, that can hardly take over decision-making and cannot replace the doctor-patient relationship.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare are growing exponentially. The field of neurosurgery is particularly suited to implement AI solutions given its technology-driven nature. It is of paramount importance to understand the basics of AI to make informed decision on how to shape current and future applications.\nWhat is the level of confidence, knowledge and the attitude of the global neurosurgical community towards AI basic concepts and applications?\nA 24-item survey was designed and distributed. The survey results reported on level of knowledge, confidence and interest in AI, perspectives and attitude towards the application of AI technologies in neurosurgery. The potential influence of demographics and work-related environment features on AI knowledge was investigated.\nWe received a total of 250 responses from 61 countries. The correct definition of 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning' and main Big Data features were identified by respectively 42%, 23% and 23% of the respondents. The survey unveiled a strong interest and a positive attitude towards the introduction of AI in the neurosurgical practice. The main concerns included trustworthiness and liability, the main barriers to implementation were considered lack of funding, infrastructure, knowledge and multidisciplinary collaboration.\nThere is a low familiarity with basic AI concepts in the neurosurgical community. Nevertheless, there is a strong interest and a positive attitude towards AI implementation. The systematization of training and the production of educational resources will be key in guaranteeing a successful implementation of AI in the evolving history of neurosurgery.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are driving innovation in biosciences and are already affecting key elements of medical scholarship and clinical care. Many schools of medicine are capitalizing on the promise of these new technologies by establishing academic units to catalyze and grow research and innovation in AI/ML. At Stanford University, we have developed a successful model for an AI/ML research center with support from academic leaders, clinical departments, extramural grants, and industry partners. The Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging uses the following 4 key tactics to support AI/ML research: project-based learning opportunities that build interdisciplinary collaboration; internal grant programs that catalyze extramural funding; infrastructure that facilitates the rapid creation of large multimodal AI-ready clinical data sets; and educational and open data programs that engage the broader research community. The center is based on the premise that foundational and applied research are not in tension but instead are complementary. Solving important biomedical problems with AI/ML requires high-quality foundational team science that incorporates the knowledge and expertise of clinicians, clinician scientists, computer scientists, and data scientists. As AI/ML becomes an essential component of research and clinical care, multidisciplinary centers of excellence in AI/ML will become a key part of the scholarly portfolio of academic medical centers and will provide a foundation for the responsible, ethical, and fair implementation of AI/ML systems.",

    "abstract": "A novel ring-gantry cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging system shows improved image quality compared to its conventional version, but its effect on autosegmentation is unknown. This study evaluates the impact of this high-performance CBCT on autosegmentation performance, inter-observer variability, contour correction times and delineation confidence, compared to the conventional CBCT.\nTwenty prostate cancer patients were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. Per patient, one pair of high-performance CBCT and conventional CBCT scans was included. Three observers manually corrected contours generated by the artificial intelligence (AI) model for prostate, seminal vesicles, bladder, rectum and bowel. Differences between AI-based and manual corrected contours were quantified using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile of Hausdorff distance (HD95). Autosegmentation performance and interobserver variation were compared using a random effects model; correction times and confidence scores using a paired \nAutosegmentation performance showed small, but statistically insignificant differences. Interobserver variability, assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient, was significantly different across most organs, but these were considered clinically irrelevant (maximum difference\u00a0=\u00a00.08). Mean contour correction times were similar for both CBCT systems (11:03 versus 11:12\u00a0min; p\u00a0=\u00a00.66). Delineation confidence scores were significantly higher with the high-performance CBCT scans for prostate, seminal vesicles and rectum (4.5 versus 3.5, 4.3 versus 3.5, 4.8 versus 4.3; all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nThe high-performance CBCT did not (clinically) improve autosegmentation performance, inter-observer variability or contour correction time compared to conventional CBCT. However, it clearly enhanced user confidence in organ delineation for prostate, seminal vesicles and rectum.",

    "abstract": "Drugs that interact with multiple therapeutic targets are potential high-value products in polypharmacology-based drug discovery, but the rational design remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to design the chemical structures of compounds that interact with multiple therapeutic target proteins. The molecular structure generation is performed by a fragment-based approach using a genetic algorithm with chemical substructures and a deep learning approach using reinforcement learning with stochastic policy gradients in the framework of generative adversarial networks. Using the proposed methods, we designed the chemical structures of compounds that would interact with two therapeutic targets of bronchial asthma, i.e., adenosine A2a receptor (ADORA2A) and phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D). We then synthesized 10 compounds and evaluated their\u00a0bioactivities via the binding assays of 39 target human proteins, including ADORA2A and PDE4D. Three of the 10 synthesized compounds successfully interacted with ADORA2A and PDE4D with high specificity.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the field of sports science by providing unprecedented insights and tools that enhance training, performance, and health management. This work examines how AI is advancing the role of sports scientists, particularly in team sports environments, by improving training load management, sports performance, and player well-being. It explores key dimensions such as load optimization, injury prevention and return-to-play, sports performance, talent identification and scouting, off-training behavior, sleep quality, and menstrual cycle management. Practical examples illustrate how AI applications have significantly advanced each area and how they support and enhance the effectiveness of sports scientists. This manuscript also underscores the importance of ensuring that AI technologies are context-specific and communicated transparently. Additionally, it calls for academic institutions to update their curriculums with AI-focused education, preparing future sports professionals to fully harness its potential. Finally, the manuscript addresses future challenges, such as the unpredictable nature of team sports, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, including clear communication and mutual understanding between sports scientists and AI experts, and the critical balance between AI-driven insights and human expertise.",

    "abstract": "The widespread propagation of wireless communication devices, from smartphones and tablets to Internet of Things (IoT) systems, has become an integral part of modern life. However, the expansion of wireless technology has also raised public concern about the potential health risks associated with prolonged exposure to electromagnetic fields. Our objective is to determine the optimal machine learning model for constructing electric field strength maps across urban areas, enhancing the field of environmental monitoring with the aid of sensor-based data collection. Our machine learning models consist of a novel and comprehensive dataset collected from a network of strategically placed sensors, capturing not only electromagnetic field readings but also additional urban features, including population density, levels of urbanization, and specific building characteristics. This sensor-driven approach, coupled with explainable AI, enables us to identify key factors influencing electromagnetic exposure more accurately. The integration of IoT sensor data with machine learning opens the potential for creating highly detailed and dynamic electromagnetic pollution maps. These maps are not merely static snapshots; they offer researchers the ability to track trends over time, assess the effectiveness of mitigation efforts, and gain a deeper understanding of electromagnetic field distribution in urban environments. Through the extensive dataset, our models can yield highly accurate and dynamic electric field strength maps. For this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis involving 566 machine learning models across eight French cities: Lyon, Saint-\u00c9tienne, Clermont-Ferrand, Dijon, Nantes, Rouen, Lille, and Paris. The analysis incorporated six core approaches: k-Nearest Neighbors, XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Linear Regression. The findings underscore the superior predictive capabilities of ensemble methods such as Random Forests and XGBoost, which outperform individual models. Simpler approaches like Decision Trees and k-NN offer effective yet slightly less precise alternatives. Neural Networks, despite their complexity, highlight the potential for further refinement in this application. In addition, our results show that the machine learning models significantly outperform the linear regression baseline, demonstrating the added value of more complex techniques in this domain. Our SHAP analysis reveals that the feature importance rankings in tree-based machine learning models differ significantly from those in k-NN, neural network, and linear regression models.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing has elevated the demands for fault diagnosis in servo motors. Traditional diagnostic methods, which rely heavily on handcrafted features and expert knowledge, struggle to achieve efficient fault identification in complex industrial environments, particularly when faced with real-time performance and accuracy limitations. This paper proposes a novel fault diagnosis approach integrating multi-scale convolutional neural networks (MSCNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), and attention mechanisms to address these challenges. Furthermore, the proposed method is optimized for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices through knowledge distillation and model quantization. This approach significantly reduces the computational complexity of the model while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy, making it well suited for edge nodes in industrial IoT scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves efficient and accurate servo motor fault diagnosis on edge devices with excellent accuracy and inference speed.",

    "abstract": "Cystoscopy is necessary for diagnosing bladder cancer, but it has limitations in identifying ambiguous lesions, such as carcinoma in situ (CIS), which leads to a high recurrence rate of bladder cancer. With the significant advancements in deep learning in the medical field, several studies have explored its application in cystoscopy. This study aimed to utilize the VGG19 and Deeplab v3+ deep learning models to classify and segment cystoscope images, respectively.\nWe classified cystoscope images obtained from 772 patients based on morphology (normal, papillary, flat, mixed) and biopsy results (normal, Ta, T1, T2, CIS, etc.). Experienced urologists annotated and labeled the lesion areas and image categories. The classification model for bladder cancer lesion, annotated with pathological results, was developed using VGG19 with an additional fully connected layer, utilizing sparse categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. The Deeplab v3+ model was used for segmenting each morphological type of bladder cancer in the cystoscope images, employing the dice coefficient loss function. The classification model was evaluated using validation accuracy and correlation with biopsy results, while the segmentation model was assessed using the Intersection over Union (IoU) combined with binary accuracy.\nThe dataset was split into training and validation sets with a 4:1 ratio. The VGG19 classification model achieved an accuracy score of 0.912. The Deeplab v3+ segmentation model achieved an IoU of 0.833 and a binary accuracy of 0.951. Visual analysis revealed a high similarity between the lesions identified by Deeplab v3+ and those labeled by experts.\nIn this study, we applied two deep learning models using well-annotated datasets of cystoscopic images. Both VGG19 and Deeplab v3+ demonstrated high performance in classification and segmentation, respectively. These models can serve as valuable tools for bladder cancer research and may aid in the diagnosis of bladder cancer.",

    "abstract": "To compare fall risk scores of hearing aids embedded with inertial measurement units (IMU-HAs) and powered by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms with scores by trained observers.\nProspective, double-blinded, observational study of fall risk scores between trained observers and those of IMU-HAs.\nTertiary referral center.\nTwo hundred fifty participants aged 55-100 years who were at risk for falls.\nFall risk was categorized using the Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) test battery consisting of the 4-Stage Balance, Timed Up and Go (TUG), and 30-Second Chair Stand tests. Performance was scored using bilateral IMU-HAs and compared to scores by clinicians blinded to the hearing aid measures.\nFall risk categorizations based on 4-Stage Balance, Timed Up and Go (TUG), and 30-Second Chair Stand tests obtained from IMU-HAs and clinicians.\nInterrater reliability was excellent across all clinicians. The 4-Stage Balance and TUG showed no statistically significant differences between clinician and HAs. However, the IMU-HAs failed to record a response in 12% of TUG trials. For the 30-Second Chair Stand test, there was a significant difference of nearly one stand count, which would have altered fall risk classification in 21% of participants.\nThese results suggest that fall risk as determined by the STEADI tests was in most instances similar for IMU-HAs and trained observers; however, differences were observed in certain situations, suggesting improvements are needed in the algorithm to maximize accurate fall risk categorization.",

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models are a new technological development with vast research use cases among medical subspecialties. These powerful large language models offer a wide range of possibilities in wound care, from personalized patient support to optimized treatment plans and improved scientific writing. They can also assist in efficiently navigating the literature and selecting and summarizing articles, enabling researchers to focus on impactful studies relevant to wound care management and enhancing response quality through prompt-learning iterations. For nonnative English-speaking medical practitioners and authors, generative AI may aid in grammar and vocabulary selection. Although reports have suggested limitations of the conversational agent on medical translation pertaining to the precise interpretation of medical context, when used with verified resources, this language model can breach language barriers and promote practice-changing advancements in global wound care. Further, AI-powered chatbots can enable continuous monitoring of wound healing progress and real-time insights into treatment responses through frequent, readily available remote patient follow-ups.However, implementing AI in wound care research requires careful consideration of potential limitations, especially in accurately translating complex medical terms and workflows. Ethical considerations are vital to ensure reliable and credible wound care research when using AI technologies. Although ChatGPT shows promise for transforming wound care management, the authors warn against overreliance on the technology. Considering the potential limitations and risks, proper validation and oversight are essential to unlock its true potential while ensuring patient safety and the effectiveness of wound care treatments.",

    "abstract": "High levels of emotional intelligence (EI) and resilience in primary care physicians (PCPs) can help them communicate better with patients, build stronger relationships with colleagues, and foster a positive and collaborative workplace. However, studies have indicated that primary care physicians (PCPs) often do not focus enough on developing these skills. Consequently, the purpose of this mixed methods study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an experiential online training (EOT) intervention in enhancing the EI and resilience of PCPs who treat patients with chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs).\nA total of 46 PCPs from Greece participated in a 25-hour EOT program, which focused on counseling skills for lifestyle change and breathing techniques for self-regulation. Quantitative data were collected using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form (TEIQue-SF) and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-25) before, immediately after, and three months post-intervention. Additionally, qualitative data were obtained through written reflections from participants regarding their clinical practice.\nThe results revealed significant improvements in EI and resilience scores immediately after the intervention (\u0395\u0399: 5.13, SD: 0.65 vs. 5.3, SD: 0.57, ",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enhance the differentiation of cystic lesions in the sellar region, such as pituitary adenomas, Rathke cleft cysts (RCCs) and craniopharyngiomas (CP), through the use of advanced neuroimaging techniques, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The goal is to explore how AI-driven models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep learning, and ensemble methods, can overcome the limitations of traditional diagnostic approaches, providing more accurate and early differentiation of these lesions. The review incorporates findings from critical studies, such as using the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset (Kaggle, San Francisco, USA)\u00a0for MRI-based brain research, highlighting the significance of statistical rigor and automated segmentation in developing reliable AI models. By drawing on these insights and addressing the challenges posed by small, single-institutional datasets, the paper aims to demonstrate how AI applications can improve diagnostic precision, enhance clinical decision-making, and ultimately lead to better patient outcomes in managing sellar region cystic lesions.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to be the world's greatest cause of death. To evaluate heart function and diagnose coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become essential. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been incorporated into diagnostic methods such as MPI to improve patient outcomes in recent years. This study aims to employ a novel approach to examine how parameters/criteria and performance metrics affect the prioritization of selected MPI techniques and AI tools in CAD diagnosis. Identifying the most effective method in these two interconnected areas will increase the CAD diagnosis rate.\nThe study includes an in-depth investigation of popular convolutional neural network (CNN) models, including InceptionV3, VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121, in addition to widely used machine learning (ML) models, including random forests (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and Na\u00efve Bayes (NB). In addition, it includes the evaluation of nuclear MPI techniques, including positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), with the non-nuclear MPI technique of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). Various performance metrics were used to evaluate AI tools. They are F1-score, recall, specificity, precision, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). For MPI techniques, the evaluation criteria include specificity, sensitivity, radiation dose, cost of scan, and study duration. The analysis was evaluated and compared using the fuzzy-based preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE), the multi-criteria decision-making method (MDCM).\nAccording to the study's findings, considering selected performance metrics or criteria, RF is the most efficient AI tool for SPECT MPI in the diagnosis of CAD with a net flow (\nIt was concluded that CMR outperformed the nuclear MPI techniques. SPECT, as the least advantageous technique, remained below average on other criteria except for the cost of the scan. Integrating the RF algorithm, which stands out as the most effective AI tool in diagnosing CAD, with SPECT MPI may contribute to SPECT becoming a superior alternative.",

    "abstract": "With the use of machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a viable diagnostic and treatment tool for oral cancer. AI can assess a variety of information, including histopathology slides and intraoral pictures.\nThe purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and accuracy of AI technology in the detection and diagnosis of oral cancer between 2020 and 2024.\nWith an emphasis on AI applications in oral cancer diagnostics, a thorough search approach was used to find pertinent publications published between 2020 and 2024. Using particular keywords associated with AI, oral cancer, and diagnostic imaging, databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched. Among the selection criteria were actual English-language research papers that assessed the effectiveness of AI models in diagnosing oral cancer. Three impartial reviewers extracted data, evaluated quality, and compiled the findings using a narrative synthesis technique.\nTwelve papers that demonstrated a range of AI applications in the diagnosis of oral cancer satisfied the inclusion criteria. This study showed encouraging results in lesion identification and prognostic prediction using machine learning and deep learning algorithms to evaluate oral pictures and histopathology slides. The results demonstrated how AI-driven technologies might enhance diagnostic precision and enable early intervention in cases of oral cancer.\nUnprecedented prospects to transform oral cancer diagnosis and detection are provided by artificial intelligence. More resilient AI systems in oral oncology can be achieved by joint research and innovation efforts, even in the face of constraints like data set variability and regulatory concerns.",

In the case of image diagnosis, AI allows automated analysis of some facial parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the precision and reproducibility of these IA analyses compared with a human operator.\nThirty subjects were selected, and frontal and profile photographs were taken of each. The photographs were previously calibrated and then analyzed by a human operator and an AI for vertical, horizontal, symmetry parameters, and facial profile angles.\nStatistically significant differences were found in at least 1 vertical, horizontal, symmetry, and facial profile measurement.\nThe 2D facial analysis performed on photographs using AI is an interesting and constantly evolving tool. However, there are still many differences with the analysis performed by the human operator, so it should be used carefully. Further studies using metric measurements should be performed to contrast the values obtained by human operators and AI and to analyze the accuracy of point selection in facial soft tissues.",

    "abstract": "Mental disorders are a critical global public health problem due to their increasing prevalence, rising costs, and significant economic burden. Despite efforts to increase the mental health workforce in T\u00fcrkiye, there is a significant shortage of psychiatrists, limiting the quality and accessibility of mental health services. This review examines the potential of artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models, to transform psychiatric care in the world and in T\u00fcrkiye. AI technologies, including machine learning and deep learning, offer innovative solutions for the diagnosis, personalization of treatment, and monitoring of mental disorders using a variety of data sources, such as speech patterns, neuroimaging, and behavioral measures. Although AI has shown promising capabilities in improving diagnostic accuracy and access to mental health services, challenges such as algorithmic biases, data privacy concerns, ethical implications, and the confabulation phenomenon of large language models prevent the full implementation of AI in practice. The review highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to develop culturally and linguistically adapted AI tools, particularly in the Turkish context, and suggests strategies such as fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation, and reinforcement learning from human feedback to increase AI reliability. Advances suggest that AI can improve mental health care by increasing diagnostic accuracy and accessibility while preserving the essential human elements of medical care. Current limitations need to be addressed through rigorous research and ethical frameworks for effective and equitable integration of AI into mental health care.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative illnesses place a heavy strain on the world's healthcare systems, particularly among the aging population. With a focus on research from January 2022 to September 2023, this scoping review, which adheres to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-Scr) criteria, examines the changing landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) applications for early AD detection and diagnosis. Forty-four carefully chosen articles were selected from a pool of 2,966 articles for the qualitative synthesis. The research reveals impressive advancements in AI-driven approaches, including neuroimaging, genomics, cognitive tests, and blood-based biomarkers. Notably, AI models focusing on deep learning (DL) algorithms demonstrate outstanding accuracy in early AD identification, often even before the onset of clinical symptoms. Multimodal approaches, which combine information from various sources, including neuroimaging and clinical assessments, provide comprehensive insights into the complex nature of AD. The study also emphasizes the critical role that blood-based and genetic biomarkers play in strengthening AD diagnosis and risk assessment. When combined with clinical or imaging data, genetic variations and polygenic risk scores help to improve prediction models. In a similar vein, blood-based biomarkers provide non-invasive instruments for detecting metabolic changes linked to AD. Cognitive and functional evaluations, which include neuropsychological examinations and assessments of daily living activities, serve as essential benchmarks for monitoring the course of AD and directing treatment interventions. When these evaluations are included in machine learning models, the diagnosis accuracy is improved, and treatment monitoring is made more accessible. In addition, including methods that support model interpretability and explainability helps in the thorough understanding and valuable implementation of AI-driven insights in clinical contexts. This review further identifies several gaps in the research landscape, including the need for diverse, high-quality datasets to address data heterogeneity and improve model generalizability. Practical implementation challenges, such as integrating AI systems into clinical workflows and clinician adoption, are highlighted as critical barriers to real-world application. Moreover, ethical considerations, particularly surrounding data privacy and informed consent, must be prioritized as AI adoption in healthcare accelerates. Performance metrics (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC)) for AI-based approaches are discussed, with a need for clearer reporting and comparative analyses. Addressing these limitations, alongside methodological clarity and critical evaluation of biases, would strengthen the credibility of AI applications in AD detection. By expanding its scope, this study highlights areas for improvement and future opportunities in early detection, aiming to bridge the gap between innovative AI technologies and practical clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare globally by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, predicting patient outcomes, and enabling personalized treatment plans. However, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Pakistan, the integration of AI into healthcare is limited due to challenges such as lack of funding, provider resistance, and inadequate training. Despite these barriers, there is growing interest among healthcare providers in understanding and adopting AI technologies to improve professional efficiency. Objective To determine knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) regarding the use of artificial intelligence (AI) among doctors in a hospital setting. Method This cross-sectional study was conducted at Mardan Medical Complex, Mardan, from January 2023 to March 2023. A total of 150 doctors from various departments participated by completing a validated questionnaire designed to assess their KAP regarding AI. The questionnaire, consisting of nine close-ended questions, was specifically designed and distributed to participants through social media applications, including WhatsApp (California, USA) and email, to maximize accessibility. It included structured questions rated on Likert scales to quantify the levels of knowledge, attitude, and practice. Participants were also asked about their exposure to AI-related training or professional work. Descriptive analysis was performed to determine the frequency and percentage of responses. Results The mean \u00b1 SD of age in this study was 36.95 \u00b1 8.58 years. Male participants were 72.66%, while 27.33% were females. The response to the questions showed that the majority of participants (66%) knew the term AI; however, they were unsure regarding its use in healthcare. The majority of doctors (67.33%) had positive thoughts about the possibility of using AI in health management. Importantly, the majority of participants (72.66%) had never had a chance to do any AI-related work in their professional lives. The assessment of KAP showed that the majority of doctors had a medium level of knowledge (36.66%), a high level of attitude (57.55%), and a low level of practice (65.66%) regarding AI. Conclusions These results conclude that the knowledge regarding AI's use in healthcare is medium and its use in clinical practice is low; however, doctors have a high level of interest in applying AI to improve their professional efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of shoulder range of motion (ROM) is crucial for evaluating patient progress. Traditional manual goniometry often lacks precision and is subject to inter-observer variability, especially in measuring shoulder internal rotation (IR). This study introduces an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach that uses clinical photography to improve the accuracy of ROM quantification. We analyzed a total of 150 clinical photographs, including 100 shoulder and 50 elbow images, taken between January and April 2022. An MMPose model with an HR-NET backbone architecture, pre-trained on the COCO-WholeBody dataset, was used to detect 17 anatomical landmarks. A random forest classifier (PoseRF) then categorized poses, and ROM angles were calculated. Concurrently, two clinicians independently measured shoulder IR at the vertebral level, and inter-observer agreement was evaluated. Linear regression analyses were conducted to correlate the AI-derived measurements with the clinicians' assessments. The AI-based algorithm accurately detected anatomical landmarks in 96% of shoulder and 100% of elbow images. Pose detection achieved 95% accuracy overall, with 100% accuracy for specific shoulder (abduction, flexion, external rotation) and elbow (flexion, extension) poses. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between the AI algorithm and human observers ranged from 0.965 to 0.997, indicating excellent inter-observer reliability. Kruskal-Wallis test showed no statistically significant differences in ROM measurements among the AI algorithm and two human observers across all joint angles (\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13534-024-00432-w.",

    "abstract": "Although the HaCaT keratinocyte model has been used in previous research to study the effects of antipsoriatic agents, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced proliferation and signal transduction in psoriasis-like keratinocytes.\nThis study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms and pathways associated with psoriasis-like inflammation caused by IMQ in human keratinocytes.\nHaCaT cells were exposed to different concentrations of IMQ to induce inflammation similar to that observed in psoriasis. Cell viability was evaluated using the MTT assay and cell morphology was examined using phase-contrast microscopy. Gene expression profiles were analyzed through whole transcriptome sequencing, followed by bio-informatics network analysis using IPA software. The GSEA was conducted with the aim of identifying enriched pathways. The expression of key cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 was confirmed by QPCR. Artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms were used to predict potential diseases and phenotypes associated with the observed gene profiles.\nIMQ treatment demonstrated a substantial positive impact on cell survival without any detectable alterations in the morphology of HaCaT cells. A comprehensive analysis of the entire set of transcribed genes identified 513 genes that exhibited differential expression. Bioinformatics analysis revealed key pathways associated with immune response, cellular proliferation, and cytokine signaling. GSEA identified significant enrichment in the IFN-\u03b3 response and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. QPCR analysis confirmed the increased mRNA expression levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in cells treated with IMQ. AI/ML algorithms have identified potential correlations with diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, lympho-proliferative malignancy, and autoimmune disorders.\nOur results highlight the importance of specific genes and pathways, particularly those associated with IFN-\u03b3 pathway and IL-6/JAK-STAT signaling. AI/ML predictions indicate potential associations with various diseases and provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for psoriasis and related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Our previous research demonstrated that a large language model (LLM) based on the transformer architecture, specifically the MegaMolBART encoder with an XGBoost classifier, effectively predicts the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of compounds. However, the permeability coefficients of compounds that can traverse this barrier remain unclear. Additionally, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) characteristics of substances obtained from the Natural Product Research Laboratory (NPRL) at China Medical University Hospital (CMUH) have not yet been determined.\nThe study aims to investigate the pharmacokinetic ADME properties and BBB permeability coefficients of NPRL compounds.\nA combined model using a transformer-based MegaMolBART encoder and XGBoost classifier was employed to predict BBB permeability. Machine learning (ML) tools from Discovery Studio were used to assess the ADME characteristics of the NPRL compounds. The CCK-8 assay was conducted to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of NPRL compounds on bEnd.3 brain endothelial cells after exposure to 10 \u03bcg/mL of the compounds. We assessed the permeability coefficient by subjecting bEnd.3 cell monolayers to the test compounds and measuring the permeability of FITC-dextran.\nThere were 4956 compounds that could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB+) and 2851 that could not (BBB-) in the B3DB dataset that was utilized for training. A total of 2461 BBB+ and 2184 BBB- compounds were used in the NPRL-CMUH dataset for testing. The permeability coefficient of temozolomide (TMZ) and 21 other BBB + compounds exceeded 10 \u00d7 10\nComputer-based predictions for the NPRL of CMUH compounds regarding their capacity to traverse the BBB are verified by the findings. Artificial intelligence (AI) prediction models have effectively identified the potential ADME characteristics of various compounds.",

    "abstract": "The Natural Product Research Laboratory (NPRL) of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH) was established in collaboration with CMUH and Professor Kuo-Hsiung Lee from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The laboratory collection features over 6000 natural products worldwide, including pure compounds and semi-synthetic derivatives. This is the most comprehensive and fully operational natural product database in Taiwan. This review article explores the history and development of the NPRL of CMUH. We then provide an overview of the recent applications and impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in new drug discovery. Finally, we examine advanced powerful AI-tools and related software to explain how these resources can be utilized in research on large-scale drug data libraries. This article presents a drug research and development (R&D) platform that combines AI with the NPRL. We believe that this approach will reduce resource wastage and enhance the research capabilities of Taiwan's academic and industrial sectors in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming cardiovascular imaging by offering advancements across multiple modalities, including echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography (CCT), cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), interventional cardiology, nuclear medicine, and electrophysiology. This review explores the clinical applications of AI within each of these areas, highlighting its ability to improve patient selection, reduce image acquisition time, enhance image optimization, facilitate the integration of data from different imaging modality and clinical sources, improve diagnosis and risk stratification. Moreover, we illustrate both the advantages and the limitations of AI across these modalities, acknowledging that while AI can significantly aid in diagnosis, risk stratification, and workflow efficiency, it cannot replace the expertise of cardiologists. Instead, AI serves as a powerful tool to streamline routine tasks, allowing clinicians to focus on complex cases where human judgement remains essential. By accelerating image interpretation and improving diagnostic accuracy, AI holds great potential to improve patient care and clinical decision-making in cardiovascular imaging.",

    "abstract": "To reveal problems of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosing gastric-type mucin-positive (GMPLs) and gastric-type mucin-negative (GMNLs) cervical lesions.\nWe selected 172 patients suspected to have lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia; their pelvic MR images were categorised into the training (n = 132) and validation (n = 40) groups. The images of the validation group were read twice by three pairs of six readers to reveal the accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The readers evaluated three images (sagittal T2-weighted image [T2WI], axial T2WI, and axial T1-weighted image [T1WI]) in every patient. The pre-trained convolutional neural network (pCNN) was used to differentiate between GMPLs and GMNLs and perform four-fold cross-validation using cases in the training group. The accuracy and AUC were obtained using the MR images in the validation group. For each case, three images (sagittal T2WI and axial T2WI/T1WI) were entered into the CNN. Calculations were performed twice independently. ICC (2,1) between first- and second-time CNN was evaluated, and these results were compared with those of readers.\nThe highest accuracy of readers was 77.50%. The highest ICC (1,1) between a pair of readers was 0.750. All ICC (2,1) values were <0.7, indicating poor agreement; the highest accuracy of CNN was 82.50%. The AUC did not differ significantly between the CNN and readers. The ICC (2,1) of CNN was 0.965.\nVariation in the inter-reader or intra-reader accuracy in MRI diagnosis limits differentiation between GMPL and GMNL. CNN is nearly as accurate as readers but improves the reproducibility of diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Measuring neurocognitive functioning in children requires validated, age-appropriate instruments that are adapted to the local cultural and linguistic context. We sought to evaluate the usability and psychometric properties of five tools that assess general intelligence, executive functioning, and sustained attention among Tanzanian children.\nWe adapted five age-appropriate neurocognitive assessment batteries from previously published assessment materials to the Tanzanian context. We enrolled children 6 months to 12 years of age residing in the rural ward of Yombo, Pwani Region. Feasibility and acceptability of all instruments was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively, including measurement of refusal rates, ceiling or floor effects, and time requirements. We assessed internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha and convergent validity using standard correlation analysis. Score gradients across age were explored using polynomial regression analysis.\nAll five instruments required minimal adaptations to the Tanzanian context. Two-hundred sixty one children aged 6 months to 12 years completed the assessment. Refusal rates were consistently low (5.9% at the highest) and no ceiling or floor effects of measurements were observed. Feedback from assessors and caregivers indicated adequate test durations and generally high acceptability of instruments. All instruments showed good internal consistency with Cronbach alphas at least 0.84 for all tests. We found satisfactory convergent validity; all test scores strongly correlated with age.\nThe five instruments identified to assess general intelligence, executive functioning, and sustained attention constructs in Tanzanian children seem to work well in this setting.",

    "abstract": "Bed regulation within Brazil's National Health System (SUS) plays a crucial role in managing care for patients in need of hospitalization. In Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, the RegulaRN Leitos Gerais platform was the information system developed to register requests for bed regulation for COVID-19 cases. However, the platform was expanded to cover a range of diseases that require hospitalization. This study explored different machine learning models in the RegulaRN database, from October 2021 to January 2024, totaling 47,056 regulations. From the data obtained, 12 features were selected from the 24 available. After that, blank and inconclusive data were removed, as well as the outcomes that had values other than discharge and death, rendering a binary classification. Data was also correlated, balanced, and divided into training and test portions for application in machine learning models. The results showed better accuracy (87.77%) and recall (87.77%) for the XGBoost model, and higher precision (87.85%) and F1-Score (87.56%) for the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, respectively. As for Specificity (82.94%) and ROC-AUC (82.13%), the Multilayer Perceptron with SGD optimizer obtained the highest scores. The results evidenced which models could adequately assist medical regulators during the decision-making process for bed regulation, enabling even more effective regulation and, consequently, greater availability of beds and a decrease in waiting time for patients.",

    "abstract": "The use of technology in healthcare and healthcare education settings has increased rapidly across the United States and accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, perceptions of new technologies in clinical nursing and nursing education are not well understood. Yet, understanding perceptions of registered nurses and nursing students toward advanced technology and artificial intelligence in clinical care and education is crucial if we are to implement these care delivery and educational innovations. This literature review investigates existing literature on registered nurses' and nursing students' attitudes toward advanced technology and artificial intelligence in nursing, including nursing education. Ten peer-reviewed studies published between 2017 and 2022 were reviewed. Findings revealed positive perceptions, such as improved patient care, efficiency, and reduced human error, but also concerns about job displacement, loss of human touch, and ethical/legal issues. Challenges in implementation, adequate training in technologies, and how technologies may reduce the human connection aspect of nursing care were identified. By recognizing the attitudes and perceptions of registered nurses and nursing students toward these advanced technologies, we can better ensure that it is ethically, effectively, and responsibly integrated into nursing practice and education.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel methodology for evaluating communication performance in rotating electric machines using Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) measurements coupled with artificial intelligence. The proposed approach focuses on assessing the quality of wireless signals in the complex, dynamic environment inside these machines, where factors like reflections, metallic surfaces, and rotational movements can significantly impact communication. RSSI is used as a key parameter to monitor real-time signal behavior, enabling a detailed analysis of communication reliability. The methodology comprises several stages, including data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. Various machine learning models are implemented and evaluated. Among these, the SVM model with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel outperforms others, achieving an accuracy of 97%, with high precision and recall scores, confirming its robustness in classifying RSSI data and handling complex signal behavior. The confusion matrix further supports the SVM model's accuracy, showing minimal misclassification.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread use of autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), avoiding collisions has become a challenging problem. Addressing the issue is not straightforward since production efficiency, collision avoidance, and energy consumption are conflicting factors. This paper proposes a novel edge computing method based on vehicle edge intelligence to solve the energy-efficient collision-free machine/AGV scheduling problem. First, a vehicle edge intelligence architecture was built, and the corresponding state transition diagrams for collision-free scheduling were developed. Second, the energy-efficient collision-free machine/AGV scheduling problem was modeled as a multi-objective function with electric capacity constraints, where production efficiency, collision prevention, and energy conservation were comprehensively considered. Third, an artificial plant community algorithm was explored based on the edge intelligence of AGVs. The proposed method utilizes a heuristic search and the swarm intelligence of multiple AGVs to realize energy-efficient collision-free scheduling and is suitable for deploying on embedded platforms for edge computing. Finally, a benchmark dataset was developed, and some benchmark experiments were conducted, where the results revealed that the proposed heuristic method could effectively instruct multiple automatic guided vehicles to avoid collisions with high energy efficiency.",

    "abstract": "We present an artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced monitoring framework designed to assist personnel in evaluating and maintaining animal welfare using a modular architecture. This framework integrates multiple deep learning models to automatically compute metrics relevant to assessing animal well-being. Using deep learning for AI-based vision adapted from industrial applications and human behavioral analysis, the framework includes modules for markerless animal identification and health status assessment (e.g., locomotion score and body condition score). Methods for behavioral analysis are also included to evaluate how nutritional and rearing conditions impact behaviors. These models are initially trained on public datasets and then fine-tuned on original data. We demonstrate the approach through two use cases: a health monitoring system for dairy cattle and a piglet behavior analysis system. The results indicate that scalable deep learning and edge computing solutions can support precision livestock farming by automating welfare assessments and enabling timely, data-driven interventions.",

    "abstract": "Visual examination of nails can reflect human health status. Diseases such as nutritive imbalances and skin diseases can be identified by looking at the colors around the plate part of the nails. We present the AI-based NAILS method to detect fingernails through segmentation and labeling. The NAILS leverages a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network model to segment and label fingernail regions from fingernail images, normalizing RGB values to monitor tiny color changes via a GUI and the use of an HD webcam in real time. The use of normalized RGB values combined with AI-based segmentation for real-time health monitoring is novel and innovative. The NAILS algorithm could be used to self-extract and archive primary signs of diseases in humans, especially in rural areas or when other testing may be not available.",

    "abstract": "One of the health challenges in the 21st century is to rethink approaches to non-communicable disease prevention. A solution is a smart city that implements technology to make health smarter, enables healthcare access, and contributes to all residents' overall well-being. Thus, this paper proposes an architecture to deliver smart health. The architecture is anchored in the Internet of Things and edge computing, and it is driven by artificial intelligence to establish three foundational layers in smart care. Experimental results in a case study on glucose prediction noninvasively show that the architecture senses and acquires data that capture relevant characteristics. The study also establishes a baseline of twelve regression algorithms to assess the non-invasive glucose prediction performance regarding the mean squared error, root mean squared error, and r-squared score, and the catboost regressor outperforms the other models with 218.91 and 782.30 in MSE, 14.80 and 27.97 in RMSE, and 0.81 and 0.31 in R2, respectively, on training and test sets. Future research works involve extending the performance of the algorithms with new datasets, creating and optimizing embedded AI models, deploying edge-IoT with embedded AI for wearable devices, implementing an autonomous AI cloud engine, and implementing federated learning to deliver scalable smart health in a smart city context.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are widely applied in various industries and everyday life, particularly in fields such as virtual assistants, healthcare, and education. However, this paper highlights that existing research has often overlooked the philosophical and media aspects. To address this, we developed an interactive system called \"Human Nature Test\". In this context, \"human nature\" refers to emotion and consciousness, while \"test\" involves a critical analysis of AI technology and an exploration of the differences between humanity and technicality. Additionally, through experimental research and literature analysis, we found that the integration of electroencephalogram (EEG) data with AI systems is becoming a significant trend. The experiment involved 20 participants, with two conditions: C1 (using EEG data) and C2 (without EEG data). The results indicated a significant increase in immersion under the C1 condition, along with a more positive emotional experience. We summarized three design directions: enhancing immersion, creating emotional experiences, and expressing philosophical concepts. Based on these findings, there is potential for further developing EEG data as a medium to enrich interactive experiences, offering new insights into the fusion of technology and human emotion.",

    "abstract": "Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) based positioning has gained popularity for accurate indoor robot positioning in indoor navigation. In daily life, it is a low-cost solution because Wi-Fi infrastructure is already installed in many indoor areas. In addition, unlike the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Wi-Fi is more suitable for use indoors because signal blocking, attenuation, and reflection restrictions create a unique pattern in places with many Wi-Fi transmitters, and more precise positioning can be performed than GNSS. This paper proposes a machine learning-based method for Wi-Fi-enabled robot positioning in indoor environments. The contributions of this research include comprehensive 3D position estimation, utilization of existing Wi-Fi infrastructure, and a carefully collected dataset for evaluation. The results indicate that the AdaBoost algorithm attains a notable level of accuracy, utilizing the dBm signal strengths from Wi-Fi access points distributed throughout a four-floor building. The mean average error (MAE) values obtained in three axes with the Adaptive Boosting algorithm are 0.044 on the ",

    "abstract": "Pollution can be broadly defined as the presence of contaminants or energy sources detrimental to ecosystems and human health. The human organism serves as a valuable indicator of ecosystem contamination. However, understanding physiological disorders and correlating specific contaminants with disease development is a complex and arduous task, necessitating extensive scientific research spanning years or even decades. To facilitate a more rapid and precise understanding of the physiological impairments induced by various contaminants, a comprehensive approach is indispensable. This review proposes a model for such an approach, which involves the systematic collection and analysis of data from ecosystem contamination monitoring, integrated with biomedical data on compromised physiological conditions in humans across different temporal and spatial scales. Given the complexity and sheer volume of data, alongside the imperative for strategic decision-making, this model leverages the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Although this paper exemplifies the model by investigating the effects of contaminants on the human organism, the model is adaptable to all ecosystem components, thereby supporting the conservation of plant and animal species.",

Phosphorylation is a major type of protein post-translational modification that plays an essential role in the process of SARS-CoV-2-host interactions. The precise identification of phosphorylation sites in host cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 will be of great importance to investigate potential antiviral responses and mechanisms and exploit novel targets for therapeutic development. Numerous computational tools have been developed on the basis of phosphoproteomic data generated by mass spectrometry-based experimental techniques, with which phosphorylation sites can be accurately ascertained across the whole SARS-CoV-2-infected proteomes. In this work, we have comprehensively reviewed several major aspects of the construction strategies and availability of these predictors, including benchmark dataset preparation, feature extraction and refinement methods, machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures, model evaluation approaches and metrics, and publicly available web servers and packages. We have highlighted and compared the prediction performance of each tool on the independent serine/threonine (S/T) and tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation datasets and discussed the overall limitations of current existing predictors. In summary, this review would provide pertinent insights into the exploitation of new powerful phosphorylation site identification tools, facilitate the localization of more suitable target molecules for experimental verification, and contribute to the development of antiviral therapies.",

    "abstract": "The overlapping molecular pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) was analyzed using relationships from a knowledge graph of 33+ million biomedical journal articles. The unsupervised learning rank aggregation algorithm from SemNet 2.0 compared the most important amino acid, peptide, and protein (AAPP) nodes connected to AD, ALS, or FTD. FTD shared 99.9% of its nodes with ALS and AD; AD shared 64.2% of its nodes with FTD and ALS; and ALS shared 68.3% of its nodes with AD and FTD. The results were validated and mapped to functional biological processes using supervised human supervision and an external large language model. The overall percentages of mapped intersecting biological processes were as follows: inflammation and immune response, 19%; synapse and neurotransmission, 19%; cell cycle, 15%; protein aggregation, 12%; membrane regulation, 11%; stress response and regulation, 9%; and gene regulation, 4%. Once normalized for node count, biological mappings for cell cycle regulation and stress response were more prominent in the intersection of AD and FTD. Protein aggregation, gene regulation, and energetics were more prominent in the intersection of ALS and FTD. Synapse and neurotransmission, membrane regulation, and inflammation and immune response were greater at the intersection of AD and ALS. Given the extensive molecular pathophysiology overlap, small differences in regulation, genetic, or environmental factors likely shape the underlying expressed disease phenotype. The results help prioritize testable hypotheses for future clinical or experimental research.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) was applied to nearly all domains of human activity, including scientific research. It is thus warranted to ask whether AI thinking should be durably involved in biomedical research. This problem was addressed by examining three complementary questions (i) What are the major barriers currently met by biomedical investigators? It is suggested that during the last 2 decades there was a shift towards a growing need to elucidate complex systems, and that this was not sufficiently fulfilled by previously successful methods such as theoretical modeling or computer simulation (ii) What is the potential of AI to meet the aforementioned need? it is suggested that recent AI methods are well-suited to perform classification and prediction tasks on multivariate systems, and possibly help in data interpretation, provided their efficiency is properly validated. (iii) Recent representative results obtained with machine learning suggest that AI efficiency may be comparable to that displayed by human operators. It is concluded that AI should durably play an important role in biomedical practice. Also, as already suggested in other scientific domains such as physics, combining AI with conventional methods might generate further progress and new applications, involving heuristic and data interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Intracranial calcifications, particularly within the falx cerebri, serve as crucial diagnostic markers ranging from benign accumulations to signs of severe pathologies. The falx cerebri, a dural fold that separates the cerebral hemispheres, presents challenges in visualization due to its low contrast in standard imaging techniques. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in machine learning and deep learning, have significantly transformed radiological diagnostics. This study aims to explore the application of AI in the segmentation and detection of falx cerebri calcifications using Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images through a comprehensive literature review and a detailed case report. The case report presents a 59-year-old patient diagnosed with falx cerebri calcifications whose CBCT images were analyzed using a cloud-based AI platform, demonstrating effectiveness in segmenting these calcifications, although challenges persist in distinguishing these from other cranial structures. A specific search strategy was employed to search electronic databases, yielding four studies exploring AI-based segmentation of the falx cerebri. The review detailed various AI models and their accuracy across different imaging modalities in identifying and segmenting falx cerebri calcifications, also highlighting the gap in publications in this area. In conclusion, further research is needed to improve AI-driven methods for accurately identifying and measuring intracranial calcifications. Advancing AI applications in radiology, particularly for detecting falx cerebri calcifications, could significantly enhance diagnostic precision, support disease monitoring, and inform treatment planning.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a concept whose goal is to imitate human intellectual activity in computers. It emerged in the 1950s and has gone through three booms. We are in the third boom, and it will continue. Medical applications of AI include diagnosing otitis media from images of the eardrum, often outperforming human doctors. Temporal bone CT and MRI analyses also benefit from AI, with segmentation accuracy improved in anatomically significant structures or diagnostic accuracy improved in conditions such as otosclerosis and vestibular schwannoma. In treatment, AI predicts hearing outcomes for sudden sensorineural hearing loss and post-operative hearing outcomes for patients who have undergone tympanoplasty. AI helps patients with hearing aids hear in challenging situations, such as in noisy environments or when multiple people are speaking. It also provides fitting information to help improve hearing with hearing aids. AI also improves cochlear implant mapping and outcome prediction, even in cases of cochlear malformation. Future trends include generative AI, such as ChatGPT, which can provide medical advice and information, although its reliability and application in clinical settings requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, with increasing incidence. Skin cancer is typically classified as melanoma or non-melanoma skin cancer. Although melanoma is less common than basal or squamous cell carcinomas, it is the deadliest form of cancer, with nearly 8300 Americans expected to die from it each year. Biopsies are currently the gold standard in diagnosing melanoma; however, they can be invasive, expensive, and inaccessible to lower-income individuals. Currently, suspicious lesions are triaged with image-based technologies, such as dermoscopy and confocal microscopy. While these techniques are useful, there is wide inter-user variability and minimal training for dermatology residents on how to properly use these devices. The use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies in dermatology has emerged in recent years to assist in the diagnosis of melanoma that may be more accessible to all patients and more accurate than current methods of screening. This review explores the current status of the application of AI-based algorithms in the detection of melanoma, underscoring its potential to aid dermatologists in clinical practice. We specifically focus on AI application in clinical imaging, dermoscopic evaluation, algorithms that can distinguish melanoma from non-melanoma skin cancers, and in vivo skin imaging devices.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a new hybrid machine learning (ML) model for the early and accurate diagnosis of heart disease. The proposed model is a combination of two powerful ensemble ML models, namely ExtraTreeClassifier (ETC) and XGBoost (XGB), resulting in a hybrid model named ETCXGB. At first, all the features of the utilized heart disease dataset were given as input to the ETC model, which processed it by extracting the predicted probabilities and produced an output. The output of the ETC model was then added to the original feature space by producing an enriched feature matrix, which is then used as input for the XGB model. The new feature matrix is used for training the XGB model, which produces the final result that whether a person has cardiac disease or not, resulting in a high diagnosis accuracy for cardiac disease. In addition to the proposed model, three other hybrid DL models, such as convolutional neural network + recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN), convolutional neural network + long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), and convolutional neural network + bidirectional long short-term memory (CNN-BLSTM), were also investigated. The proposed ETCXGB model improved the prediction accuracy by 3.91%, while CNN-RNN, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-BLSTM enhanced the prediction accuracy by 1.95%, 2.44%, and 2.45%, respectively, for the diagnosis of cardiac disease. The simulation outcomes illustrate that the proposed ETCXGB hybrid ML outperformed the classical ML and DL models in terms of all performance measures. Therefore, using the proposed hybrid ML model for the diagnosis of cardiac disease will help the medical practitioner make an accurate diagnosis of the disease and will help the healthcare society decrease the mortality rate caused by cardiac disease.",

    "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence in orthodontics is emerging as a tool for localizing cephalometric points in two-dimensional X-rays. AI systems are being evaluated for their accuracy and efficiency compared to conventional methods performed by professionals. The main objective of this study is to identify the artificial intelligence algorithms that yield the best results for cephalometric landmark localization, along with their learning system. A literature search was conducted across PubMed-MEDLINE, Cochrane, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science. Observational and experimental studies from 2013 to 2023 assessing the detection of at least 13 cephalometric landmarks in two-dimensional radiographs were included. Studies requiring advanced computer engineering knowledge or involving patients with anomalies, syndromes, or orthodontic appliances, were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) tools. Of 385 references, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria (1 diagnostic accuracy study and 12 retrospective cohorts). Six were high-risk, and seven were low-risk. Convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based AI algorithms showed point localization accuracy ranging from 64.3 to 97.3%, with a mean error of 1.04 mm \u00b1 0.89 to 3.40 mm \u00b1 1.57, within the clinical range of 2 mm. YOLOv3 demonstrated improvements over its earlier version. CNN have proven to be the most effective AI system for detecting cephalometric points in radiographic images. Although CNN-based algorithms generate results very quickly and reproducibly, they still do not achieve the accuracy of orthodontists.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that focuses on designing machines or systems that can perform operations that would typically need human intelligence. AI is a rapidly developing technology that has grabbed the interest of researchers from all across the globe in the healthcare industry. Advancements in machine learning and data analysis have revolutionized oral health diagnosis, treatment, and management, making it a transformative force in healthcare, particularly in dentistry. Particularly in dentistry, AI is becoming increasingly prevalent as it contributes to the diagnosis of oro-facial diseases, offers treatment modalities, and manages practice in the dental operatory. All dental disciplines, including oral medicine, operative dentistry, pediatric dentistry, periodontology, orthodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, prosthodontics, and forensic odontology, have adopted AI. The majority of AI applications in dentistry are for diagnoses based on radiographic or optical images, while other tasks are less applicable due to constraints such as data availability, uniformity, and computational power. Evidence-based dentistry is considered the gold standard for decision making by dental professionals, while AI machine learning models learn from human expertise. Dentistry AI and technology systems can provide numerous benefits, such as improved diagnosis accuracy and increased administrative task efficiency. Dental practices are already implementing various AI applications, such as imaging and diagnosis, treatment planning, robotics and automation, augmented and virtual reality, data analysis and predictive analytics, and administrative support. The dentistry field has extensively used artificial intelligence to assist less-skilled practitioners in reaching a more precise diagnosis. These AI models effectively recognize and classify patients with various oro-facial problems into different risk categories, both individually and on a group basis. The objective of this descriptive review is to review the most recent developments of AI in the field of dentistry.",

    "abstract": "The three-vessel view (3VV) is a standardized transverse scanning plane used in fetal cardiac ultrasound screening to measure the absolute and relative diameters of the pulmonary artery (PA), ascending aorta (Ao), and superior vena cava, as required. The PA/Ao ratio is used to support the diagnosis of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, vascular diameters are measured manually by examiners, which causes intra- and interobserver variability in clinical practice. In the present study, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence-based method for the standardized and quantitative evaluation of 3VV. In total, 315 cases and 20 examiners were included in this study. We used the object-detection software YOLOv7 for the automated extraction of 3VV images and compared three segmentation algorithms: DeepLabv3+, UNet3+, and SegFormer. Using the PA/Ao ratios based on vascular segmentation, YOLOv7 plus UNet3+ yielded the most appropriate classification for normal fetuses and those with CHD. Furthermore, YOLOv7 plus UNet3+ achieved an arithmetic mean value of 0.883 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which was higher than 0.749 for residents and 0.808 for fellows. Our automated method may support unskilled examiners in performing quantitative and objective assessments of 3VV images during fetal cardiac ultrasound screening.",

    "abstract": "Liver disease can significantly impact life expectancy, making early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention critical challenges in medical care. Imaging diagnostics play a crucial role in diagnosing and managing liver diseases. Recently, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging analysis has become indispensable in healthcare. AI, trained on vast datasets of medical images, has sometimes demonstrated diagnostic accuracy that surpasses that of human experts. AI-assisted imaging diagnostics are expected to contribute significantly to the standardization of diagnostic quality. Furthermore, AI has the potential to identify image features that are imperceptible to humans, thereby playing an essential role in clinical decision-making. This capability enables physicians to make more accurate diagnoses and develop effective treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Additionally, AI is anticipated to become a powerful tool in personalized medicine. By integrating individual patient imaging data with clinical information, AI can propose optimal plans for treatment, making it an essential component in the provision of the most appropriate care for each patient. Current reports highlight the advantages of AI in managing liver diseases. As AI technology continues to evolve, it is expected to advance personalized diagnostics and treatments and contribute to overall improvements in healthcare quality.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between emotional intelligence and coping strategies used by adolescents with disabilities, on the one hand to understand how emotional skills influence stress management and everyday challenges and, on the other hand, considering that it could help specialists to develop interventions and educational programs that support the improvement of emotional skills and coping strategies among adolescents with disabilities.\nThis cross-sectional study included 100 Romanian adolescents with neuromotor disabilities aged 13 to 18 years (M = 15.2) divided into three groups according to the stages of adolescence: Group 1 (13 years-46 respondents), Group 2 (14 to 17 years-26 respondents), and Group 3 (18 years-28 respondents). They completed a questionnaire that assessed the emotional intelligence of the adolescents (positive impression, interpersonal, intrapersonal, stress management, adaptability, and general mood) as well as another one that assessed the possible cognitive emotional coping strategies (e.g., \"blame self\", \"acceptance\", \"rumination\", \"positive refocusing\", \"refocus on planning\", \"positive reappraisal\", \"putting into perspective\", \"catastrophizing\", and \"blaming others\") that they may adopt in managing life situations related to their health problem.\nGroup 3 has significantly higher scores than Group 2 on the Interpersonal subscale and also significantly higher scores than Group 1 on the Stress management. Our analysis also revealed significant correlations between adaptive coping strategies and emotional intelligence domains across all groups, with positive associations between acceptance and stress management, as well as between positive refocusing and adaptability. Regression analysis identified adaptive coping strategies as significant predictors of emotional intelligence, explaining 29% of its variance.\nOur findings underscore the critical importance of targeted interventions to enhance emotional regulation and adaptive coping strategies in adolescents with neuromotor disabilities. By focusing on strengthening emotional intelligence and tailoring interventions to developmental stages, these programs can promote better emotional and social functioning, particularly in challenging situations.",

    "abstract": "Despite their diverse assumptions, clinical psychology approaches share the goal of mental health promotion. The literature highlights their usefulness, but also some issues related to their effectiveness, such as their difficulties in monitoring psychological change. The elective strategy for activating and managing psychological change is the clinical question. But how do different types of questions foster psychological change? This work tries to answer this issue by studying therapist-patient interactions with a ML model for text analysis. The goal was to investigate how psychological change occurs thanks to different types of questions, and to see if the ML model recognized this difference in analyzing patients' answers to therapists' clinical questions. The experimental dataset of 14,567 texts was divided based on two different question purposes, splitting answers in two categories: those elicited by questions asking patients to start describing their clinical situation, or those from asking them to detail how they evaluate their situation and mental health condition. The hypothesis that these categories are distinguishable by the model was confirmed by the results, which corroborate the different valences of the questions. These results foreshadow the possibility to train ML and AI models to suggest clinical questions to therapists based on patients' answers, allowing the increase of clinicians' knowledge, techniques, and skills.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) is increasingly recognized as a key factor in healthcare, where managing emotions is vital for job satisfaction, productivity, and interpersonal relationships. For nurses, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, EI plays a pivotal role in navigating emotional challenges and improving their quality of work life (QoWL). This study examined how EI moderates the relationship between nurses' preparedness to care for COVID-19 patients and their QoWL. A cross-sectional, correlational design was used, involving 267 nurses from various healthcare settings. Data were collected through the Emotional Intelligence Scale, the Quality of Nursing Work Life survey, and demographic questionnaires. The sample was predominantly female (94.4%), with a mean age of 37.47 years (SD = 8.09) and an average of 8.43 years of experience (SD = 6.33). Most nurses (87.3%) attended COVID-19-related workshops, with 76.4% feeling prepared to care for COVID-19 patients. Emotional intelligence levels were high, with 93.6% of nurses reporting good personal competence and 85.4% reporting good social competence. Descriptive results showed that 71% of nurses perceived their QoWL as good, while 29% rated it as fair. Pearson correlation analysis revealed significant positive correlations between both personal competence (r = 0.33, ",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver, excluding excessive alcohol consumption and other known causes of liver injury. Animal models are often used to explore different pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets of MASLD. The aim of this study is to apply an artificial intelligence (AI) system based on second-harmonic generation (SHG)/two-photon-excited fluorescence (TPEF) technology to automatically assess the dynamic patterns of hepatic steatosis in MASLD mouse models.\nWe evaluated the characteristics of hepatic steatosis in mouse models of MASLD using AI analysis based on SHG/TPEF images. Six different models of MASLD were induced in C57BL/6 mice by feeding with a western or high-fat diet, with or without fructose in their drinking water, and/or by weekly injections of carbon tetrachloride.\nBody weight, serum lipids, and liver enzyme markers increased at 8 and 16 weeks in each model compared to baseline. Steatosis grade showed a steady upward trend. However, the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network (CRN) histological scoring method detected no significant difference between 8 and 16 weeks. In contrast, AI analysis was able to quantify dynamic changes in the area, number, and size of hepatic steatosis automatically and objectively, making it more suitable for preclinical MASLD animal experiments.\nAI recognition technology may be a new tool for the accurate diagnosis of steatosis in MASLD, providing a more precise and objective method for evaluating steatosis in preclinical murine MASLD models under various experimental and treatment conditions.",

    "abstract": "To develop an unsupervised artificial intelligence algorithm for identifying and quantifying the presence of false lumen thrombosis (FL) after Frozen Elephant Trunk (FET) operation in computed tomography angiographic (CTA) images in an interdisciplinary approach.\nCTA datasets were retrospectively collected from eight patients after FET operation for aortic dissection from a single center. Of those, five patients had a residual aortic dissection with partial false lumen thrombosis, and three patients had no false lumen or thrombosis. Centerlines of the aortic lumen were defined, and images were calculated perpendicular to the centerline. Lumen and thrombosis were outlined and used as input for a variational autoencoder (VAE) using 2D convolutional neural networks (2D CNN). A 2D latent space was chosen to separate images containing false lumen patency, false lumen thrombosis and no presence of false lumen. Classified images were assigned a thrombus score for the presence or absence of FL thrombosis and an average score for each patient.\nImages reconstructed by the trained 2D CNN VAE corresponded well to original images with thrombosis. Average thrombus scores for the five patients ranged from 0.05 to 0.36 where the highest thrombus scores coincided with the location of the largest thrombus lesion. In the three patients without large thrombus lesions, average thrombus scores ranged from 0.002 to 0.01.\nThe presence and absence of a FL thrombus can be automatically classified by the 2D CNN VAE for patient-specific CTA image datasets. As FL thrombosis is an indication for positive aortic remodeling, evaluation of FL status is essential in follow-up examinations. The presented proof-of-concept is promising for the automated classification and quantification of FL thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Endoscopic assessment for the diagnosis of gastric cancer is limited by interoperator variability and lack of real-time capability. Recently, Raman spectroscopy-based artificial intelligence (AI) has been proposed as a solution to overcome these limitations.\nTo compare the performance of the AI-enabled Raman spectroscopy with that of high-definition white light endoscopy (HD-WLE) for the risk classification of gastric lesions.\nThis was a randomized double-arm feasibility proof-of-concept trial in which participants with suspected gastric neoplasia underwent endoscopic assessment using either the Raman spectroscopy-based AI (SPECTRA IMDx\u2122) or HD-WLE performed by expert endoscopists. Identified lesions were classified in real time as having either low or high risk for neoplasia. Diagnostic outcomes were compared between the two groups using histopathology as the reference.\nA total of 20 patients with 25 lesions were included in the study. SPECTRA, in real-time, performed at a statistically similar level to that of HD-WLE performed by expert endoscopists, achieving an overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100%, 80%, and 89.0%, respectively, by patient; and 100%, 80%, and 92%, respectively, by lesion, while expert endoscopists using HD-WLE attained a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100%, 80%, and 90%, respectively, by patient; and 100%, 83.3%, and 91.7%, respectively, by lesion, in differentiating high-risk from low-risk gastric lesions.\nThe SPECTRA's comparable performance with that of HD-WLE suggests that it can potentially be a valuable adjunct for less experienced endoscopists to attain accurate and real-time diagnoses of gastric lesions. Larger-scale prospective randomized trials are recommended to validate these promising results further.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in neuroimaging, particularly diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET), have significantly enhanced the early detection of biomarkers in neurodegenerative and neuro-ophthalmic disorders. These include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease. This review highlights the transformative role of advanced diffusion MRI techniques-Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging-in identifying subtle microstructural changes in the brain and visual pathways that precede clinical symptoms. When integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, these techniques achieve unprecedented diagnostic precision, facilitating early detection of neurodegeneration and inflammation. Additionally, next-generation PET tracers targeting misfolded proteins, such as tau and alpha-synuclein, along with inflammatory markers, enhance the visualization and quantification of pathological processes in vivo. Deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks and multimodal transformers, further improve diagnostic accuracy by integrating multimodal imaging data and predicting disease progression. Despite challenges such as technical variability, data privacy concerns, and regulatory barriers, the potential of AI-enhanced neuroimaging to revolutionize early diagnosis and personalized treatment in neurodegenerative and neuro-ophthalmic disorders is immense. This review underscores the importance of ongoing efforts to validate, standardize, and implement these technologies to maximize their clinical impact.",

    "abstract": "This perspective paper explores the untapped potential of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning-based dimension reduction techniques in multimodal neuroimaging analysis of Long COVID fatigue. The complexity and high dimensionality of neuroimaging data from modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pose significant analytical challenges. Deep neural networks and other machine learning approaches offer powerful tools for managing this complexity and extracting meaningful patterns. The paper discusses current challenges in neuroimaging data analysis, reviews state-of-the-art AI approaches for dimension reduction and multimodal integration, and examines their potential applications in Long COVID research. Key areas of focus include the development of AI-based biomarkers, AI-informed treatment strategies, and personalized medicine approaches. The authors argue that AI-driven multimodal neuroimaging analysis represents a paradigm shift in studying complex brain disorders like Long COVID. While acknowledging technical and ethical challenges, the paper emphasizes the potential of these advanced techniques to uncover new insights into the condition, which might lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for those affected by Long COVID fatigue. The broader implications for understanding and treating other complex neurological and psychiatric conditions are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) effectively diagnoses malignant and pre-malignant gastrointestinal lesions. In the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising results in enhancing EUS sensitivity and accuracy, particularly for subepithelial lesions (SELs) like gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Furthermore, AI models have shown high accuracy in predicting malignancy in gastric GISTs and distinguishing between benign and malignant intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). The utility of AI has also been applied to existing and emerging technologies involved in the performance and evaluation of EUS-guided biopsies. These advancements may improve training in EUS, allowing trainees to focus on technical skills and image interpretation. This review evaluates the current state of AI in EUS, covering imaging diagnosis, EUS-guided biopsies, and training advancements. It discusses early feasibility studies and recent developments, while also addressing the limitations and challenges. This article aims to review AI applications to EUS and its applications in clinical practice while addressing pitfalls and challenges.",

    "abstract": "Nurses are frontline caregivers who handle heavy workloads and high-stakes activities. They face several mental health issues, including stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression. The welfare of nurses and the standard of patient treatment depends on resolving this problem. Artificial intelligence is revolutionising healthcare, and its integration provides many possibilities in addressing these concerns. This review examines literature published over the past 40 years, concentrating on AI integration in nursing for mental health support, improved patient care, and ethical issues. Using databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, a thorough search was conducted with Boolean operators, narrowing results for relevance. Critically examined were publications on artificial intelligence applications in patient care ethics, mental health, and nursing and mental health. The literature examination revealed that, by automating repetitive chores and improving workload management, artificial intelligence (AI) can relieve mental health challenges faced by nurses and improve patient care. Practical implications highlight the requirement of using rigorous implementation strategies that address ethical issues, data privacy, and human-centred decision-making. All changes must direct the integration of artificial intelligence in nursing to guarantee its sustained and significant influence on healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping healthcare, offering transformative potential for diagnostics, treatment, and patient management. Despite its growing significance, there is limited integration of AI education in medical curricula, raising concerns about the readiness of future healthcare professionals to utilize AI technologies. This study aims to evaluate the readiness of medical students in Saudi Arabia to embrace AI and to assess the current state of AI education, AI Application use, and future perspectives for medical students.\na cross-sectional design was employed. It involved medical students from various regions of Saudi Arabia. Data were collected using an anonymous, online, structured, and validated tool from previous studies. The survey included sociodemographic information, details on AI education, the usage of AI applications, intended specialties, and a Medical Artificial Intelligence Readiness Scale for Medical Students (MAIRS-MS). The data were extracted and revised in an Excel sheet. Statistical analysis was conducted using the IBM SPSS computer program with appropriate statistical tests.\nThis study enrolled 572 medical students, with a mean age of 21.93 years. Most students were Saudi (99.0%), and 43.7% lived in the western region of Saudi Arabia. Most students attended a government medical college (97.41%), and 64.3% of students were in their clinical years. Only 14.5% of the students had received formal AI education, while 34.3% had participated in extracurricular AI training. The mean (SD) MAIRS-MS score was 68.39 (18.3), with higher scores associated with female students, those from the central region, and those with advanced English and computer technology skills (\nthere is limited AI education and moderate AI readiness among medical students in Saudi colleges, with significant variability in terms of gender, region, and educational background. These findings underscore the need to integrate AI education into medical curricula to better prepare future physicians for AI-enabled healthcare systems.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into in vitro fertilization (IVF) laboratories signifies a significant advancement in reproductive medicine. AI technologies, such as neural networks, deep learning, and machine learning, promise to enhance quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) through increased accuracy, consistency, and operational efficiency. This comprehensive review examines the effects of AI on IVF laboratories, focusing on its role in automating processes such as embryo and sperm selection, optimizing clinical outcomes, and reducing human error. AI's data analysis and pattern recognition capabilities offer valuable predictive insights, enhancing personalized treatment plans and increasing success rates in fertility treatments. However, integrating AI also brings ethical, regulatory, and societal challenges, including concerns about data security, algorithmic bias, and the human-machine interface in clinical decision-making. Through an in-depth examination of current case studies, advancements, and future directions, this manuscript highlights how AI can revolutionize IVF by standardizing processes, improving patient outcomes, and advancing the precision of reproductive medicine. It underscores the necessity of ongoing research and ethical oversight to ensure fair and transparent applications in this sensitive field, assuring the responsible use of AI in reproductive medicine.",

    "abstract": "Post-stroke dysphagia is highly prevalent and causes complication. While video games have demonstrated potential to increase patient engagement in rehabilitation, their efficacy in stroke patients with dysphagia remains unclear. This aim of this study was to explore the effectiveness of the artificial intelligence-based video-game (AI-VG) intervention in improving swallowing function among stroke patients with dysphagia.\nA prospective, single blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in a rehabilitation hospital from October 2023 to July 2024. Participants were randomly assigned to either the AI-VG system group or the usual care group. All participants received training for 30\u00a0min per session per day, five times per week for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was change in swallowing function from baseline (T0) to post-intervention (T1) and 1 month follow-up (T2). Secondary outcomes included changes in laryngeal function, oral intake function, nutritional status, and swallowing-related quality of life. The adherence, satisfaction, and acceptance of the two groups were evaluated. Changes in outcomes over time were compared using generalized estimating equation modeling.\nA total of 84 participants (AI-VG group\u00a0=\u00a042, age\u00a0=\u00a065.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.70 years, 57.10\u00a0% male; usual care group\u00a0=\u00a042, age\u00a0=\u00a066.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.10 years, 69.00\u00a0% male) were included in this study. Compared with the usual care group, the AI-VG group showed significantly improved swallowing function, with a mean group difference of 4.02 (95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0from\u00a0-6.16 to\u00a0-1.89, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) at T1 and 4.14 (95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0from\u00a0-6.16 to 2.12, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) at T2. Oral intake function, nutritional status, and swallowing-related quality of life improved significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for overall group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction). Adherence was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (median [IQR], 18.00 [17.00-20.00] vs. 16.00 [15.00-17.00], P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The intervention group had higher levels of acceptance and satisfaction of AI-VG (103.00 [100.50-104.00] and 73.00 [72.00-74.00], respectively). No significant difference was observed in laryngeal function (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05).\nThe AI-VG intervention is an effective method for enhancing swallowing function in patients with post-stroke dysphagia. Future validation through multicenter, large-sample RCTs are warranted to confirm the findings and explore broader clinical applications.\nClinicalTrials.

Compared with the usual care group, the AI-VG group showed significantly improved swallowing function, with a mean group difference of 4.02 (95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0from\u00a0-6.16 to\u00a0-1.89, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) at T1 and 4.14 (95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0from\u00a0-6.16 to 2.12, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) at T2. Oral intake function, nutritional status, and swallowing-related quality of life improved significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for overall group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction). Adherence was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (median [IQR], 18.00 [17.00-20.00] vs. 16.00 [15.00-17.00], P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The intervention group had higher levels of acceptance and satisfaction of AI-VG (103.00 [100.50-104.00] and 73.00 [72.00-74.00], respectively). No significant difference was observed in laryngeal function (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05).",

    "abstract": "One of the foremost causes of global healthcare burden is cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. The medical records, lab results, radiographs, endoscopic images, tissue samples, and medical histories of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies provide an enormous amount of medical data. There are encouraging signs that the advent of artificial intelligence could enhance the treatment of gastrointestinal issues with this data. Deep learning algorithms can swiftly and effectively analyze unstructured, high-dimensional data, including texts, images, and waveforms, while advanced machine learning approaches could reveal new insights into disease risk factors and phenotypes. In summary, artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize various features of gastrointestinal cancer care, such as early detection, diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis. This paper highlights some of the many potential applications of artificial intelligence in this domain. Additionally, we discuss the present state of the discipline and its potential future developments.",

    "abstract": "Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) is a transformative surgical intervention for hip joint disorders, necessitating meticulous preoperative planning for optimal outcomes. With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), preoperative planning paradigms have evolved, leveraging AI algorithms for enhanced decision support and imaging analysis. This systematic review aims to comprehensively evaluate the role of AI in THA preoperative planning, synthesizing evidence from studies exploring various AI techniques and their applications.\nA systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted to identify relevant articles. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies focusing on AI in THA preoperative planning, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and comparative studies.\nSix studies from China met the inclusion criteria, collectively analyzing 831 patients. AI-assisted planning demonstrated superior accuracy in estimating prosthesis size and positioning compared to traditional methods. However, limitations such as geographic bias and language constraints were noted.\nAI-assisted preoperative planning significantly enhances femoral positioning accuracy, providing superior outcomes compared to traditional methods. This improvement in precision, particularly in the placement of femoral and acetabular components, has been consistently observed across studies, making AI an indispensable tool in improving the overall success of Total Hip Arthroplasty. Despite promising findings, further research is warranted to address limitations and optimize the integration of AI technologies into routine clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Giant cell arteritis (GCA), a systemic vasculitis affecting large and medium-sized arteries, poses significant diagnostic and management challenges, particularly in preventing irreversible complications like vision loss. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), offer promising solutions to enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize treatment strategies for GCA. This systematic review, conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, synthesizes existing literature on AI applications in GCA care, with a focus on diagnostic accuracy, treatment outcomes, and predictive modeling. A comprehensive search of databases (MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science) from their inception to September 2024 identified 309 studies, with four meeting inclusion criteria. The review highlights the potential of AI to improve diagnostic accuracy through image analysis of color Doppler ultrasound and clinical data, with AI models like random forests, convolutional neural networks, and logistic regression demonstrating effectiveness in predicting GCA diagnosis and relapse after glucocorticoid tapering. Despite these promising findings, challenges such as the need for larger datasets, prospective validation, and addressing ethical concerns remain. The review underscores the transformative potential of AI in GCA care while emphasizing the need for further research to refine and validate AI-driven tools for broader clinical implementation.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionised numerous aspects of our daily lives, with profound implications across various sectors, including healthcare. Although the concept of AI in healthcare was introduced in the early 1970s, the integration of this technology in healthcare is still in the evolution phase. Despite barriers, the current decade is witnessing an increased utility of AI into diverse specialities of the medical field to enhance precision medicine, predict diagnosis, therapeutic results, and prognosis; this includes respiratory medicine, critical care, and in their allied specialties. AI algorithms are widely studied in areas like mechanical ventilation, sleep medicine, lung ultrasound, and pulmonary function diagnostics and the results are found to be promising. The quality of patient care and safety can be greatly enhanced if respiratory care professionals fully understand the concept and importance of AI, as they are already incorporating various aspects of this technology into their clinical practice. Awareness of AI in the clinical field is essential during this phase; hence, it is desirable to establish widely accepted standards presented in a clear and accessible language. This article aims to describe the existing and prospective role of AI in the field of respiratory care and allied areas.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted various fields, including oncology. This comprehensive review examines the current applications and future prospects of AI in lung cancer research and treatment. We critically analyze the latest AI technologies and their applications across multiple domains, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, immunomics, microbiomics, radiomics, and pathomics in lung cancer research. The review elucidates AI's transformative role in enhancing early detection, personalizing treatment strategies, and accelerating therapeutic innovations. We explore AI's impact on precision medicine in lung cancer, encompassing early diagnosis, treatment planning, monitoring, and drug discovery. The potential of AI in analyzing complex datasets, including genetic profiles, imaging data, and clinical records, is discussed, highlighting its capacity to provide more accurate diagnoses and tailored treatment plans. Additionally, we examine AI's potential in predicting patient responses to immunotherapy and forecasting survival rates, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The review addresses technical challenges facing AI implementation in lung cancer care, including data quality and quantity issues, model interpretability, and ethical considerations, while discussing potential solutions and emphasizing the importance of rigorous validation. By providing a comprehensive analysis for researchers and clinicians, this review underscores AI's indispensable role in combating lung cancer and its potential to usher in a new era of medical breakthroughs, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to conduct a scoping and bibliometric review of articles using artificial intelligence (AI) in tennis. The analysis covered various aspects of tennis, including performance, health, match results, physiological data, tennis expenditure, and prize amounts. Articles on AI in tennis published until 2024 were retrieved from the Web of Science database. A total of 389 records were screened, and 108 articles were retained for analysis. The analysis identified intermittent gaps in publication output during certain intervals, notably in the years 2007-2008 and 2012-2013. From 2012 onward, there was a clear upward trend in publications and citations, peaking in 2022. The theme was led by China, the United States, and Australia. These countries maintain their status as the top contributors in terms of publications. The analysis of author collaborations revealed multiple clusters, with notable contributions from researchers in China, Australia, Japan, and the United States. This bibliometric review has elucidated the evolution of AI research in tennis, highlighting the countries and authors that have significantly contributed to this field over the years. The prediction model suggests that the number of articles and citations on this topic will continue to increase over the next decade (until 2034).",

    "abstract": "Solid organ transplantation (SOT) is vital for end-stage organ failure but faces challenges like organ shortage and rejection. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential to improve outcomes through better matching, success prediction, and automation. However, the evolution of AI in SOT research remains underexplored. This study uses bibliometric analysis to identify trends, hotspots, and key contributors in the field.\n821 articles from the Web of Science Core Collection were exported for analysis. Microsoft Excel 2021 was used for descriptive statistics. VOSviewer, CiteSpace, Scimago Graphica, and Biblioshiny were used for bibliometric analysis. The ggalluvial package in R was utilized to create Sankey diagrams, and top articles were selected based on citation count.\nThis analysis reveals the rapid expansion of AI in SOT. Key areas include robotic surgery, organ allocation, outcome prediction, immunosuppression management, and precision medicine. Robotic surgery has improved transplant outcomes. AI algorithms optimize organ matching and enhance fairness. Machine learning models predict outcomes and guide treatment, while AI-based systems advance personalized immunosuppression. AI in precision medicine, including diagnostics and imaging, is crucial for transplant success.\nThis study highlights AI's transformative potential in SOT, with significant contributions from countries like the USA, Canada, and the UK. Key institutions such as the University of Toronto and the University of Pittsburgh have played vital roles. However, practical challenges like ethical issues, bias, and data integration remain. Fostering international and interdisciplinary collaborations is crucial for overcoming these challenges and accelerating AI's integration into clinical practice, ultimately improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In this article, the authors propose a repurposing of the concept of entrustment to help guide the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in health professions education (HPE). Entrustment can help identify and mitigate the risks of incorporating generative AI tools with limited transparency about their accuracy, source material, and disclosure of bias into HPE practice. With AI's growing role in education-related activities, like automated medical school application screening and feedback quality and content appraisal, there is a critical need for a trust-based approach to ensure these technologies are beneficial and safe. Drawing parallels with HPE's entrustment concept, which assesses a trainee's readiness to perform clinical tasks-or entrustable professional activities-the authors propose assessing the trustworthiness of AI tools to perform an HPE-related task across 3 characteristics: ability (competence to perform tasks accurately), integrity (transparency and honesty), and benevolence (alignment with ethical principles). The authors draw on existing theories of entrustment decision-making to envision a structured way to decide on AI's role and level of engagement in HPE-related tasks, including proposing an AI-specific entrustment scale. Identifying tasks that AI could be entrusted with provides a focus around which considerations of trustworthiness and entrustment decision-making may be synthesized, making explicit the risks associated with AI use and identifying strategies to mitigate these risks. Responsible, trustworthy, and ethical use of AI requires health professions educators to develop safeguards for using it in teaching, learning, and practice-guardrails that can be operationalized via applying the entrustment concept to AI. Without such safeguards, HPE practice stands to be shaped by the oncoming wave of AI innovations tied to commercial motivations, rather than modeled after HPE principles-principles rooted in the trust and transparency that are built together with trainees and patients.",

    "abstract": "Though simple in its fundamental mechanism - a critical disruption of local blood supply - stroke is complicated by the intricate nature of the neural substrate, the neurovascular architecture, and their complex interactions in generating its clinical manifestations. This complexity is adequately described by high-resolution imaging with sensitivity not only to parenchymal macrostructure but also microstructure and functional tissue properties, in conjunction with detailed characterization of vascular topology and dynamics. Such descriptive richness mandates models of commensurate complexity only artificial intelligence could plausibly deliver, if we are to achieve the goal of individually precise, personalized care.\nAdvances in machine vision technology, especially deep learning, are delivering higher fidelity predictive, descriptive, and inferential tools, incorporating increasingly rich imaging information within ever more flexible models. Impact at the clinical front line remains modest, however, owing to the challenges of delivering models robust to the noisy, incomplete, biased, and comparatively small-scale data characteristic of real-world practice.\nThe potential benefit of introducing AI to stroke, in imaging and elsewhere, is now unquestionable, but the optimal approach - and the path to real-world application - remain unsettled. Deep generative models offer a compelling solution to current obstacles and are predicted powerfully to catalyse innovation in the field.",

    "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in scientific writing is rapidly increasing, raising concerns about authorship identification, content quality, and writing efficiency.\nThis study investigates the real-world impact of ChatGPT, a large language model, on those aspects in a simulated publication scenario.\nForty-eight individuals representing 3 medical expertise levels (medical students, residents, and experts in allergy or dermatology) evaluated 3 blinded versions of an atopic dermatitis case report: one each human written (HUM), AI generated (AI), and combined written (COM). The survey assessed authorship, ranked their preference, and graded 13 quality criteria for each text. Time taken to generate each manuscript was also recorded.\nAuthorship identification accuracy mirrored the odds at 33%. Expert participants (50.9%) demonstrated significantly higher accuracy compared to residents (27.7%) and students (19.6%, \nAI can deceptively mimic human writing, particularly for less experienced readers. Although AI-assisted writing is appealing and offers significant time savings, human oversight remains crucial to ensure accuracy, ethical considerations, and optimal quality. These findings underscore the need for transparency in AI use and highlight the potential of human-AI collaboration in the future of scientific writing.",

    "abstract": "Emergency nurses face various challenging conditions and many moral distress that may associated with fatigue from providing care. The spiritual intelligence of nurses has been found to have an impact on the quality of care. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the spiritual intelligence of emergency nurses with fatigue from providing care and moral distress in emergency nurses.\nThis descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 nurses working in the emergency departments of hospitals in Semnan and Sabzevar, who were selected by stratified random method. They were asked to complete the spiritual intelligence, nurse fatigue scale, and moral distress questionnaire through self-reporting. The data were analyzed using SPSS 26 and Amos software, path analysis, and correlation tests.\nAn increase in spiritual intelligence leads to a significant reduction in moral distress (\nThe results showed that spiritual intelligence has an inverse relationship with moral distress and fatigue from providing care. Moral distress has a direct relationship with fatigue from providing care. Therefore, interventions in the field of increasing spiritual intelligence and reducing moral distress and fatigue from providing care are recommended.",

    "abstract": "Liver cancer remains one of the most formidable challenges in modern medicine, characterized by its high incidence and mortality rate. Emerging evidence underscores the critical roles of the immune microenvironment in tumor initiation, development, prognosis, and therapeutic responsiveness. However, the composition of the immune microenvironment of liver cancer (LC-IME) and its association with clinicopathological significance remain unelucidated. In this review, we present the recent developments related to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for studying the immune microenvironment of liver cancer, focusing on the deciphering of complex high-throughput data. Additionally, we discussed the current challenges of data harmonization and algorithm interpretability for studying LC-IME.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has dramatically improved the prognosis for some cancers but can be associated with myocarditis, adverse cardiovascular events, and mortality.\nThe aim of this study was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict the increased likelihood for the development of ICI-related myocarditis and adverse cardiovascular events.\nCancer patients treated with ICI at a tertiary institution from 2011 to 2022 were reviewed. Baseline characteristics, laboratory values, electrocardiograms, and cardiovascular clinical outcomes were extracted. A composite outcome of ICI-related myocarditis and major adverse cardiovascular events (transient ischemic attack/stroke, new diagnosis of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death) was used to develop a multimodal joint fusion AI model by combining baseline tabular data with electrocardiogram (ECG) in a single end-to-end model. ECG data were parsed using 1-D convolution and tubular data using multilayer perceptron.\nOf 2,258 cancer patients who had ICI therapy and troponin measurement (mean age 68.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.5\u00a0years, 59.7% male), the composite of cardiovascular clinical adverse events, including ICI-related myocarditis and major adverse cardiovascular events, occurred in 264 (11.7%) unique patients, with 428 events overall (including 59 [3%] ICI-related myocarditis events and 59 [3%] cardiac deaths). The proposed joint fusion model outperformed individual ECG and baseline electronic medical record data and laboratory value models with an area under the operating characteristics curve of 0.72 (0.64 true positive rate and 0.98 negative predictive value).\nA multimodal fusion AI model to predict myocarditis and adverse cardiovascular events in cancer patients starting ICI therapy had good prognostic performance. It may have clinical utility in identifying at-risk patients who may benefit from closer surveillance.",

    "abstract": "The current study presents a multiphysics numerical model for a micro-planar proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell (H-SOFC). The numerical model considered an anode-supported H-SOFC with direct internal reforming (DIR) of methane. The model solves coupled nonlinear equations, including continuity, momentum, mass transfer, chemical and electrochemical reactions, and energy equations. Furthermore, The numerical model results are used in artificial intelligence (AI) models, the K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and, artificial neural network (ANN), to predict the current density and power density of the H-SOFC. The results show that increasing the air-to-fuel (A/F) ratio decreases the current density and overall cell power. In particular, improvements in power and current density observed in H-SOFC when the A/F ratio is set to 0.5, resulting in a respective increase of 2\u00a0% and 7\u00a0% compared to the initial state at A/F\u00a0=\u00a01. With an error rate of less than 1\u00a0% and an R-score of around 99\u00a0%, the ANN model shows good agreement with the numerical results.",

    "abstract": "Our opinion piece pays homage to the evolution of medical practices, tracing back to the era of Hippocrates, through significant historical milestones, and drawing parallels with the principles underpinning foundational artificial intelligence (AI) models. It emphasizes the shared ethos of both domains: a commitment to comprehensive care that values diverse data integration and individualized patient treatment. The excitement surrounding foundation models in medical imaging is understandable. However, a critical and cautious approach is crucial before widespread adoption. By addressing the present 4 major limitations (ie, data bias and generalizability, interpretability of AI models, data scarcity and diversity, and computational resources and infrastructure) and fostering a culture of rigorous research, we can unlock the true potential of these models and revolutionize medical care. This critique (opinion) paper highlights the need for a more measured approach in the field of ",

    "abstract": "The levels of M2 macrophages are significantly associated with the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, current detection methods in clinical settings remain challenging. Our study aims to develop a weakly supervised artificial intelligence model using globally labeled histological images, to predict M2 macrophage levels and forecast the prognosis of HCC patients by integrating clinical features.\nCIBERSORTx was used to calculate M2 macrophage abundance. We developed a slide-level, weakly-supervised clustering method for Whole Slide Images (WSIs) by integrating Masked Autoencoders (MAE) with ResNet-32t to predict M2 macrophage abundance.\nWe developed an MAE-ResNet model to predict M2 macrophage levels using WSIs. In the testing dataset, the area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI) was 0.73 (0.59-0.87). We constructed a Cox regression model showing that the predicted probabilities of M2 macrophage abundance were negatively associated with the prognosis of HCC (HR=1.89, p=0.031). Furthermore, we incorporated clinical data, screened variables using Lasso regression, and built the comprehensive prediction model that better predicted prognosis. (HR=2.359, p=0.001).\nOur models effectively predicted M2 macrophage levels and HCC prognosis. The findings suggest that our models offer a novel method for determining biomarker levels and forecasting prognosis, eliminating additional clinical tests, thereby delivering substantial clinical benefits.",

    "abstract": "We are writing to address the growing interest in the role of artificial intelligence (AI) within healthcare, particularly in the field of reproductive health. As technology continues to evolve, AI offers an unprecedented opportunity to transform how we diagnose, treat, and improve access to reproductive services, especially in underserved communities. AI-driven tools, supported by machine learning and big data analytics, are already demonstrating their potential in enhancing outcomes in reproductive health. These tools can predict fertility outcomes with impressive accuracy, optimize in vitro fertilization (IVF) success rates, and identify early signs of reproductive disorders, such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and ovarian cancer. By analyzing biomarkers, medical histories, and lifestyle factors, AI algorithms empower healthcare providers to deliver personalized and effective treatment plans tailored to individual needs.",

    "abstract": "To identify and assess artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled products reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that are potentially applicable to emergency medicine (EM).\nThe FDA AI-enabled products website was accessed to identify all marketed products as of March 2024. Board-certified EM physicians analyzed all products for applicability to EM practice. Inclusion criteria included products used by EM physicians directly or non-EM physicians participating directly in the evaluation and management of patients in an acute care setting. The Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) Evidence Rating Matrix was used to rate the net health benefit of applicable products.\nA total of 882 AI-enabled products have been reviewed by the FDA from 1995 to 2024. There were 272 products that were updates of prior products that were excluded, leaving 610 unique products. Products were most commonly evaluated by Radiology (454/610), Cardiovascular (59/610), and Neurology (25/610) panels. We found 154 (25\u00a0%) products applicable to EM that were approved through Radiology (121/154), Cardiovascular (24/154), Neurology (5/154), Anesthesiology (3/154), and Ophthalmology (1/154) panels. There were 30 products that were rated as having a comparable or incremental net health benefit with moderate certainty (a C+ rating).\nAn increasing number of AI-enabled products are available and regulated by the FDA. We have identified 154 that are applicable to EM, primarily related to assisting with diagnosis on various imaging modalities. There remain many opportunities for EM to assist in product reviews and meaningful translation of products into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Over 90% of pregnant women and 76% expectant fathers search for pregnancy health information. We examined readability, accuracy and quality of answers to common obstetric anesthesia questions from the popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots ChatGPT and Bard.\nTwenty questions for generative AI chatbots were derived from frequently asked questions based on professional society, hospital and consumer websites. ChatGPT and Bard were queried in November 2023. Answers were graded for accuracy by four obstetric anesthesiologists. Quality was measured using Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Print (PEMAT). Readability was measured using six readability indices. Accuracy, quality and readability were compared using independent t-test.\nBard readability scores were high school level, significantly easier than ChatGPT's college level by all scoring metrics (P\u00a0<0.001). Bard had significantly longer answers (P\u00a0<0.001), yet with similar accuracy of Bard (85\u00a0% \u00b1 10) and ChatGPT (87\u00a0% \u00b1 14) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.5). PEMAT understandability scores were no statistically significantly different (P\u00a0=\u00a00.06). Actionability by PEMAT scores for Bard was significantly higher (22% vs. 9%) than ChatGPT (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) CONCLUSION: Answers to questions about \"labor epidurals\" should be accurate, high quality, and easy to read. Bard at high school reading level, was well above the goal 4",

Workforce perception is a powerful indicator of technology use and acceptance, however, there is little research available on the perceptions of allied health professionals (AHPs) toward AI in health care.\nThis study aimed to explore AHP perceptions of AI and the opportunities and challenges for its use in health care delivery.\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted at a health service in, Queensland, Australia, using the Shinners Artificial Intelligence Perception tool.\nA total of 231 (22.1%) participants from 11 AHPs responded to the survey. Participants were mostly younger than 40 years (157/231, 67.9%), female (189/231, 81.8%), working in a clinical role (196/231, 84.8%) with a median of 10 years' experience in their profession. Most participants had not used AI (185/231, 80.1%), had little to no knowledge about AI (201/231, 87%), and reported workforce knowledge and skill as the greatest challenges to incorporating AI in health care (178/231, 77.1%). Age (P=.01), profession (P=.009), and AI knowledge (P=.02) were strong predictors of the perceived professional impact of AI. AHPs generally felt unprepared for the implementation of AI in health care, with concerns about a lack of workforce knowledge on AI and losing valued tasks to AI. Prior use of AI (P=.02) and years of experience as a health care professional (P=.02) were significant predictors of perceived preparedness for AI. Most participants had not received education on AI (190/231, 82.3%) and desired training (170/231, 73.6%) and believed AI would improve health care. Ideas and opportunities suggested for the use of AI within the allied health setting were predominantly nonclinical, administrative, and to support patient assessment tasks, with a view to improving efficiencies and increasing clinical time for direct patient care.\nEducation and experience with AI are needed in health care to support its implementation across allied health, the second largest workforce in health. Industry and academic partnerships with clinicians should not be limited to AHPs with high AI literacy as clinicians across all knowledge levels can identify many opportunities for AI in health care.",

    "abstract": "There is no consensus on whether cognitive measures among attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) subtypes exhibit more similarities or differences, and most of them have been conducted on English-speaking subjects, lacking cross-cultural perspectives. The present study was aimed at investigating the intelligence structures of school-age children with ADHD who speak Chinese, using a multicenter and large sample size approach, offering some references for clinicians.\n772 children aged 6 to 12 years with ADHD took part in the cross-sectional study. All participants underwent the Chinese Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition assessment. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistics 24 was used for statistical analyses.\nNo significant differences were found in full intelligence quotient (FIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ), performance quotient (PIQ), as well as most subtest scores among ADHD subtypes. The analysis of variance showed that the boys' scores were higher than girls' scores in PIQ (\nOur study supported that ADHD substyles shared more similarities in intelligence structures. Boys outperformed girls in PIQ and some subtests, suggesting that the importance to consider the gender differences and the distribution of intellectual strengths and weaknesses. Older children outperformed in block design and object assembly, but underperformed in VIQ and VC factor. This indicated the need to focus on language development and screen for specific learning disabilities in managing school-age children with ADHD.",

    "abstract": "In 2019, COVID-19 began one of the greatest public health challenges in history, reaching pandemic status the following year. Systems capable of predicting individuals at higher risk of progressing to severe forms of the disease could optimize the allocation and direction of resources. In this work, we evaluated the performance of different Machine Learning algorithms when predicting clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, using clinical data from hospital admission alone. This data was collected during a prospective, multicenter cohort that followed patients with respiratory syndrome during the pandemic. We aimed to predict which patients would present mild cases of COVID-19 and which would develop severe cases. Severe cases were defined as those requiring access to the Intensive Care Unit, endotracheal intubation, or even progressing to death. The system achieved an accuracy of 80%, with Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 91%, Positive Predictive Value of 87% and Negative Predictive Value of 82%. Considering that only data from hospital admission was used, and that this data came from low-cost clinical examination and laboratory testing, the low false positive rate and acceptable accuracy observed shows that it is feasible to implement prediction systems based on artificial intelligence as an effective triage method.",

    "abstract": "Pes planus (flatfoot) and pes cavus (high arch foot) are common foot deformities, often requiring clinical and radiographic assessment for diagnosis and potential subsequent management. Traditional diagnostic methods, while effective, pose limitations such as cost, radiation exposure, and accessibility, particularly in underserved areas.\nTo develop deep learning algorithms that detect and classify such deformities using smartphone cameras.\nAn algorithm that integrated a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) into a smartphone camera was utilized to detect pes planus and pes cavus deformities. This case control study was conducted at a tertiary hospital with participants recruited from two orthopaedic foot and ankle clinics. The CNN was trained and tested using photographs of the medial aspect of participants' feet, taken under standardized conditions. Participants included subjects with standard foot alignment, pes planus, or pes cavus determined by an expert clinician using the foot posture index. The model's performance was assessed in comparison to clinical assessment and radiographic measurements, specifically lateral tarsal-first metatarsal angle and calcaneal inclination angle.\nThe CNN model demonstrated high accuracy in diagnosing both pes planus and pes cavus, with an optimized area under the curve of 0.90 for pes planus and 0.90 for pes cavus. It showed a specificity and sensitivity of 84% and 87% for pes planus detection, respectively; and 97% and 70% for pes cavus, respectively. The model's prediction correlated moderately with radiographic lateral Meary's angle measurements, indicating the model's excellent reliability in assessing food arch deformity (\nThis study highlights the potential of using a smartphone-based CNN model as a screening tool that is reliable and accessible for the detection of pes planus and pes cavus deformities, which is especially beneficial for underserved communities and patients with pain generated by subtle foot arch deformities.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in women. Although the important role of metabolism in the molecular pathogenesis of BC is known, there is still a need for robust metabolomic biomarkers and predictive models that will enable the detection and prognosis of BC. This study aims to identify targeted metabolomic biomarker candidates based on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for the specific detection of BC.\nData obtained after targeted metabolomics analyses using plasma samples from BC patients (n = 102) and healthy controls (n = 99) were used. Machine learning (ML) models based on raw data were developed, then feature selection methods were applied, and the results were compared. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), an XAI method, was used to clinically explain the decisions of the optimal model in BC prediction.\nThe results revealed that variable selection increased the performance of ML models in BC classification, and the optimal model was obtained with the logistic regression (LR) classifier after support vector machine (SVM)-SHAP-based feature selection. SHAP annotations of the LR model revealed that Leucine, isoleucine, L-alloisoleucine, norleucine, and homoserine acids were the most important potential BC diagnostic biomarkers. Combining the identified metabolite markers provided robust BC classification measures with precision, recall, and specificity of 89.50%, 88.38%, and 83.67%, respectively.\nIn conclusion, this study adds valuable information to the discovery of BC biomarkers and underscores the potential of targeted metabolomics-based diagnostic advances in the management of BC.",

    "abstract": "This review aimed to explore the scientific literature concerning the methodologies and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of endodontics. The findings may equip dentists with the necessary technical knowledge to understand the opportunities presented by AI.\nArticles published between 1992 and 2023 were retrieved through an electronic search of Medline via the PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The search, which was limited to articles published in English, aimed to identify relevant studies by employing the following keywords: \"artificial intelligence,\" \"machine learning,\" \"deep learning,\" \"endodontic,\" \"root canal treatment,\" and \"radiography.\" Ultimately, 71 studies that addressed the application of AI in endodontics were selected.\nNumerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of AI applications in endodontics. These uses encompass the identification of root fractures and periapical lesions, assessment of working length, investigation of root canal system anatomy, prediction of retreatment success, and evaluation of dental pulp stem cell viability.\nAI technology is poised to advance aspects of endodontics including scheduling, patient care, management of drug-drug interactions, prognostic diagnosis, and the emerging area of robotic endodontic surgery. AI methods have demonstrated accuracy and precision in the identification, assessment, and prediction of diseases. Thus, AI can significantly improve endodontic diagnosis and treatment, increasing the overall efficacy of endodontic therapy.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and mixed reality (MR), within human-computer interaction (HCI), are rapidly redefining areas of healthcare by introducing new approaches to patient care and clinical education. This editorial explores how these technologies, through Extended Mind Theory, enhance mental health treatment and medical training. AI-powered virtual therapists, using natural language processing and predictive analytics, provide accessible, personalized mental health support, allowing for remote and immersive therapy. In MR environments, patients with anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or phobias can safely engage in therapeutic exercises, confronting fears in controlled, virtual settings. In clinical education, AI and MR deliver adaptive, immersive training tools that respond to individual needs, enabling repeated practice in a risk-free environment. These tools improve skills and build confidence by simulating high-stakes scenarios like emergency response, with HCI principles ensuring user-friendly and experiential learning. Ethical considerations, including data security and transparency, are essential as these tools integrate into healthcare. This blend of AI, MR, and HCI redefines healthcare boundaries, extending cognitive and emotional support into virtual spaces, enhancing both patient care and clinical training.",

The platform utilized computer vision algorithms to detect clamp placement and removal, enabling precise WIT measurement. Expert-reviewed surgical videos served as the ground truth. Platform-derived WITs were compared to those in surgeon operative reports using paired-sample \nOf 64 eligible cases, 61 were included in the final analysis. Platform-derived WITs were within 1\u2009min of the ground truth in all procedures, within 30\u2009s in 97%, and within 10\u00a0s in over 80%. The mean difference between platform-derived WITs and ground truth was 8.3\u00a0s, significantly lower than the 2.45\u2009min difference for operative reports (\nThis study demonstrates the high accuracy of a surgical intelligence platform in measuring WIT during partial nephrectomies. The findings support the use of AI-based surgical time measurement for precise intraoperative documentation and highlight the potential of integrating these data with EHRs to advance research on surgical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The 2030 French Innovation Healthcare national plan defined \"Digital Healthcare\" as one of its priority. The deployment of digital pathology and artificial intelligence fits perfectly into this framework. Therefore we evaluated the pathologist's interest in those fields by conducting an online survey among members of the French Society of Pathology, mainly composed of senior pathologists and trainees (n=2301). We collected 123 answers originating nationwide and representative of all status of practice. A heavy majority of participants (83%) declared themselves \"interested or very interested\" in digital transition and AI. Twenty-six percent of participants took part in academic research projects and 20% in industrial research projects. With digital pathology becoming increasingly common nationwide, there is a growing interest of pathologists in the development and validation of AI algorithms. In order to support this dynamic, a commission for research on artificial intelligence has been created under the authority of the French Society of Pathology.",

    "abstract": "To assess whether an artificial intelligence (AI)-based reassurance-call can inform patients about potential complications and provides reassurance following a prostate biopsy.\nFrom October 2022 to December 2023, 42 patients aged 40 to 70 years undergoing their first prostate biopsy were recruited. The 'Reassurance-call' service was utilized to inform and monitor patients for complications. Participants were randomized into three groups: AI-assisted Reassurance-call service (Group 1), human-assisted Reassurance-call service (Group 2), and no call (Group 3). The primary outcome measured was patient satisfaction with the Reassurance-call service, assessed using a Likert scale. Secondary outcomes included satisfaction with complication management and anxiety levels, evaluated using the Likert scale, visual analog scale (VAS), and the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI).\nSatisfaction with Reassurance-call averaged 4.20 (standard deviation [SD] 0.56) for Group 1 and 4.71 (SD 0.47) for Group 2, showing a statistically significant difference. Satisfaction regarding complication management using Likert scale was 4.13 (SD 0.52) for Group 1, 4.43 (SD 0.76) for Group 2, and 3.79 (SD 0.80) for Group 3 with no statistically significant differences. Satisfaction regarding complication management using VAS averaged 8.33 (SD 1.23) for Group 1, 8.57 (SD 1.45) for Group 2, and 7.07 (SD 1.86) for Group 3, indicating significant differences. Anxiety levels using STAI averaged 40.00 (SD 10.54) for Group 1, 39.14 (SD 8.29) for Group 2, and 35.00 (SD 9.46) for Group 3, showing no significant differences. Anxiety levels using VAS averaged 5.07 (SD 2.79) for Group 1, 2.21 (SD 2.64) for Group 2, and 3.50 (SD 2.28) for Group 3, with significant differences observed.\nAI demonstrated potential in enhancing patient reassurance and managing complications post-prostate biopsy, although human interaction proved superior in certain aspects. Further studies with larger cohorts are necessary to verify the effectiveness of AI-based tools.",

    "abstract": "This preliminary study tested whether non-invasive, remote Elastic Scattering Spectroscopy (ESS) measurements obtained in the oral cavity can be used as a proxy to accurately differentiate between patients with laryngeal cancer versus laryngeal leukoplakia.\n20 patients with laryngeal lesions [cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a010),leukoplakia (n\u00a0=\u00a010)] were clinically assessed and categorized by otolaryngologists per standard clinical practice. Patient demographics of age, race, sex, and smoking history were collected. A machine-learning artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm was applied to classify patients using ESS spectra of patients with benign laryngeal leukoplakia or laryngeal cancer. Specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), F1, and area-under-the-curve (AUC) were calculated. Additional algorithms stratified spectral data by sub-anatomical site and smoking status to explore diagnostic capability.\nOverall, the algorithm had a sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a074\u00a0%, specificity\u00a0=\u00a040\u00a0%, PPV\u00a0=\u00a051\u00a0%, NPV\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0%, F1\u00a0=\u00a00.61 and AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.65. When stratifying by former and active smokers, algorithm sensitivities increased to 85\u00a0% and 77\u00a0%. Analysis by sub-anatomic location yielded an AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.77 for lateral tongue, and when stratified by (former/current) smoking status, demonstrated AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.94 and 0.83, sensitivities\u00a0=\u00a098\u00a0% and 76\u00a0%, and specificities\u00a0=\u00a085\u00a0% and 86\u00a0%. Algorithm output from the mucosal lip yielded sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a089\u00a0%, specificity\u00a0=\u00a088\u00a0%, PPV\u00a0=\u00a083\u00a0%, and NPV\u00a0=\u00a092\u00a0% in former smokers.\nThis pilot study demonstrated ESS technology coupled with AI-assisted statistical modeling, could differentiate between patients with laryngeal leukoplakia versus cancer with good precision, especially with smoking status and anatomic subclassification. If ESS can be utilized in the oral cavity as a non-invasive screening tool for laryngeal cancer, it would greatly facilitate early detection in specialized/non-specialized clinics, and under-resourced regions.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a severe condition associated with numerous cardiovascular complications, including heart failure. The complex biological and morphological relationship between OSA and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) poses challenges in predicting adverse cardiovascular outcomes. While artificial intelligence (AI) has shown potential for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke risks in other conditions, there is a lack of detailed, bias-free, and compressed AI models for ASCVD and stroke risk stratification in OSA patients. This study aimed to address this gap by proposing three hypotheses: (i) a strong relationship exists between OSA and ASCVD/stroke, (ii) deep learning (DL) can stratify ASCVD/stroke risk in OSA patients using surrogate carotid imaging, and (iii) including OSA risk as a covariate with cardiovascular risk factors can improve CVD risk stratification.\nThe study employed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) search strategy, yielding 191 studies that link OSA with coronary, carotid, and aortic atherosclerotic vascular diseases. This research investigated the link between OSA and CVD, explored DL solutions for OSA detection, and examined the role of DL in utilizing carotid surrogate biomarkers by saving costs. Lastly, we benchmark our strategy against previous studies.\n(i) This study found that CVD and OSA are indirectly or directly related. (ii) DL models demonstrated significant potential in improving OSA detection and proved effective in CVD risk stratification using carotid ultrasound as a biomarker. (iii) Additionally, DL was shown to be useful for CVD risk stratification in OSA patients; (iv) There are important AI attributes such as AI-bias, AI-explainability, AI-pruning, and AI-cloud, which play an important role in CVD risk for OSA patients.\nDL provides a powerful tool for CVD risk stratification in OSA patients. These results can promote several recommendations for developing unique, bias-free, and explainable AI algorithms for predicting ASCVD and stroke risks in patients with OSA.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging enables a one-stop assessment of heart structure and function. Artificial intelligence (AI) can simplify and automate work flows and improve image post-processing speed and diagnostic accuracy; thus, it greatly affects many aspects of CMR. This review highlights the application of AI for left heart analysis in CMR, including quality control, image segmentation, and global and regional functional assessment. Most recent research has focused on segmentation of the left ventricular myocardium and blood pool. Although many algorithms have shown a level comparable to that of human experts, some problems, such as poor performance of basal and apical segmentation and false identification of myocardial structure, remain. Segmentation of myocardial fibrosis is another research hotspot, and most patient cohorts of such studies have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Whether the above methods are applicable to other patient groups requires further study. The use of automated CMR interpretation for the diagnosis and prognosis assessment of cardiovascular diseases demonstrates great clinical potential. However, prospective large-scale clinical trials are needed to investigate the real-word application of AI technology in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The growing presence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in our society, particularly in the educational field, is undeniable. This fact has led to various studies on its implications for learning and teaching. However, as with other technological resources, these implications will depend on how teachers use GenAI. Therefore, it is essential to identify teachers' beliefs regarding the use of GenAI for teaching and learning.\nTo this end, a questionnaire was designed and completed by 321 university teachers. This questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first included questions about the participants' demographic information and a Likert scale on teachers' pedagogical beliefs. The second part consisted of a 32-item Likert scale that evaluated teachers' beliefs about the impact of GenAI on their students' learning and their own teaching. These aspects were reflected through items that considered GenAI as either an educational opportunity or a threat.\nThe results showed that, of all the variables analyzed, only pedagogical beliefs and the frequency of previous GenAI use influenced beliefs about GenAI usage. Specifically, teachers with constructivist beliefs saw greater potential in GenAI compared to others. Similarly, teachers who regularly used these technologies had more positive beliefs about their educational use than those who used them sporadically or not at all. Lastly, it was also observed that while teachers valued the positive effects of GenAI on their teaching work, they also considered that its use could be detrimental to the learning processes of their students, making them more superficial.\nThese findings underline the importance of providing teachers with training focused on constructive approaches that enable them to maximize the potential of GenAI in education. In particular, it is crucial to promote teaching practices that, through student-centered GenAI use, foster active and reflective processes in students, aligned with the competencies demanded by today's society.",

    "abstract": "Implementation of behavior therapy for ADHD faces challenges in community settings. We describe development of a community-based implementation model for adolescent ADHD behavior therapy (Supporting Teens' Autonomy Daily; STAND) blended with Motivational Interviewing (MI). A stakeholder-engaged development approach is used based on the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework. Resulting model features include: (a) task-shifting supervision from experts to agency supervisors, (b) holding bi-weekly technical assistance drop-ins to provide training and implementation supports, (c) MI integrity monitoring and feedback by artificial intelligence (AI), (d) AI-generated metrics for STAND content fidelity, (e) digitizing resources (manual, worksheets, tips, videos) on a clinician dashboard, (f) creating visual displays of feedback using badges and graphs, and (g) adding a rapport-building session prior to manualized content. We conducted stakeholder focus groups (",

    "abstract": "Smart cities, artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, and low-carbon building materials are pivotal to public health, environmental sustainability, and green efficiency. Despite their critical importance, understanding public perceptions and attitudes toward these domains remains underexplored. Additionally, the effective use of advanced technologies like convolutional neural networks (CNN) in predicting and promoting low-carbon solutions in construction is gaining attention.\nThis study employs a dual approach: (1) A survey of 200 respondents was conducted to gauge public perceptions and attitudes toward smart cities, AI in medicine, and low-carbon building materials. (2) A CNN model was developed and implemented to predict the performance of low-carbon building materials. The model utilized convolutional and pooling layers to capture local features and spatial information from image datasets, with tasks including image classification and segmentation.\nThe survey results indicate high awareness of smart cities (80%), with 60% associating them with environmental protection and green living. For AI in medicine, 70% of respondents are aware of its applications, but only 45% perceive it as environmentally beneficial. Regarding low-carbon building materials, 60% expressed willingness to pay premium prices, and 65% recognized their positive environmental impact. The CNN model demonstrated high prediction accuracy on both training and validation datasets, effectively aiding in the identification of low-carbon materials and reducing building energy consumption and carbon emissions.\nThe findings highlight significant public awareness and diverse attitudes toward these critical domains, suggesting the need for improved communication and advocacy for AI's environmental benefits. The application of CNN models in the construction industry showcases a promising pathway to enhance material selection efficiency and foster sustainable practices. These insights are essential for aligning public understanding with technological advancements to achieve environmental and public health goals.",

    "abstract": "In the study, we aimed to introduce a formula for measuring the oesophageal total wall thickness area, which could be used for developing an artificial intelligence-based algorithm for the detection of patients whose total wall thickness area exceeds the norms.\nMathematical formulas for measuring the square area of the oesophageal total wall thickness area were introduced and applied. Children were grouped according to their weight in clusters. For each cluster, the range (minimal and maximal value) were established. The measurements were done by using the formula for the area of the circular ring according to the formula A = n (B2-b2); the product of n and subtraction square b (smaller radius) and square B (bigger radius). The basic data for our calculations were derived from papers published by Dalby \nThe square area (in mm\nTotal wall thickness area could be used for monitoring children with eosinophilic oesophagitis and other oesophageal diseases. The method could also be applied for adults. Therefore, it can be a foundation for further progress with applying artificial intelligence algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The manufacturing sector's interest in additive manufacturing (AM) methods is increasing daily. The increase in energy consumption requires optimization of energy consumption in rapid prototyping technology. This study aims to minimize energy consumption with determined production parameters. Four machine learning algorithms are preferred to model the energy consumption of the fused deposition modeling-based 3D printer. The real-time measured test sample data were trained, and the prediction model between the parameters of 3D fabrication and the energy consumption was created. The predicted model was evaluated using five performance criteria. These are mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), ",

    "abstract": "Pancreaticobiliary endoscopy is an essential tool for diagnosing and treating pancreaticobiliary diseases. However, it does not fully meet clinical needs, which presents challenges such as significant difficulty in operation and risks of missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has enhanced the diagnostic and treatment efficiency and quality of pancreaticobiliary endoscopy. Diagnosis and differential diagnosis based on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) images, pathology of EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration or biopsy, need for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and assessment of operational difficulty, postoperative complications and prediction of patient prognosis, and real-time procedure guidance. This review provides an overview of AI applications in pancreaticobiliary endoscopy and proposes future development directions in aspects such as data quality and algorithmic interpretability, aiming to provide new insights for the integration of AI technology with pancreaticobiliary endoscopy.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to examine neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses' perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly language models, and their impact on nursing practices.\nAI is rapidly spreading in healthcare, transforming nursing practice. Understanding the role of AI in NICUs in the discharge process is crucial for understanding nurses' perceptions of these technologies.\nThe qualitative, phenomenological study used semi-structured interviews. Data were collected in a public hospital in Gaziantep from January to June 2024. Fifteen NICU nurses participated. Data were analyzed using content analysis.\nMost nurses found AI to be a valuable tool for saving time and simplifying information delivery in clinical processes. However, concerns were raised about AI potentially reducing human interaction and weakening the use of professional judgment. Serious concerns about AI's reliability and ethical implications were also expressed.\nAI is considered a potentially supportive tool in nursing practice, but its integration must consider the ethical implications and impact on the use of professional judgment. Nursing is based on human interactions and AI should be considered an additive tool to enhance care.\nAI integration in nursing requires careful and balanced implementation. Future research should delve deeper into the ethical dimensions of AI and its long-term effects on nursing practices.",

    "abstract": "Gliomas are the most prevalent form of primary brain tumours. Recently, targeting the PD-1 pathway with immunotherapies has shown promise as a novel glioma treatment. However, not all patients experience long-lasting benefits, underscoring the necessity to discover reliable biomarkers for predicting treatment outcomes. This study applied a range of advanced artificial intelligence methods to identify a new biomarker linked to the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in glioma patients. Through an extensive analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing and bulk transcriptomic data from over 3000 patients, the gene SLFN12 emerged as a significant and independent predictor of immunotherapy response. Our results indicate that elevated SLFN12 expression is associated with worse overall survival across various glioma cohorts. Notably, we found that patients with high SLFN12 levels are less likely to respond favourably to anti-PD-1 treatment, positioning SLFN12 as a clinically valuable biomarker for personalised treatment decisions. Functional studies revealed that SLFN12 is involved in key immune-related pathways, shedding light on its potential role in altering the tumour microenvironment and impacting immunotherapy outcomes. Additional laboratory experiments confirmed the role of SLFN12 in promoting glioma cell proliferation, migration and macrophage recruitment. In summary, this study identifies SLFN12 as a novel biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response in glioma patients, offering new insights for precision immunotherapy approaches.",

    "abstract": "Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a common cause of drug-resistant focal epilepsy but can be challenging to detect visually on magnetic resonance imaging. Three artificial intelligence models for automated FCD detection are publicly available (MAP18, deepFCD, MELD) but have only been compared on single-center data. Our first objective is to compare them on independent multicenter test data. Additionally, we train and compare three new models and make them publicly available.\nWe retrospectively collected FCD cases from four epilepsy centers. We chose three novel models that take two-dimensional (2D) slices (2D-nnUNet), 2.5D slices (FastSurferCNN), and large 3D patches (3D-nnUNet) as inputs and trained them on a subset of Bonn data. As core evaluation metrics, we used voxel-level Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), cluster-level F\nWe collected 329 subjects, 244 diagnosed with FCD (27.7\u2009\u00b1\u200914.4\u2009years old, 54% male) and 85 healthy controls (7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4\u2009years old, 51% female). We used 118 subjects for model training and kept the remaining subjects as an independent test set. 3D-nnUNet achieved the highest F\nThis study shows the variance in performance for FCD detection models in a multicenter dataset. The two models with 3D input data showed the highest sensitivity. The 2D models performed worse than all other models, suggesting that FCD detection requires 3D data. The greatly improved precision of 3D-nnUNet may make it a sensible choice to aid FCD detection.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots, such as ChatGPT, have been shown to mimic individual human behaviour in a wide range of psychological and economic tasks. Do groups of AI chatbots also mimic collective behaviour? If so, artificial societies of AI chatbots may aid social scientific research by simulating human collectives. To investigate this theoretical possibility, we focus on whether AI chatbots natively mimic one commonly observed collective behaviour: homophily, people's tendency to form communities with similar others. In a large simulated online society of AI chatbots powered by large language models (N\u2009=\u200933,299), we find that communities form over time around bots using a common language. In addition, among chatbots that predominantly use English (N\u2009=\u200917,746), communities emerge around bots that post similar content. These initial empirical findings suggest that AI chatbots mimic homophily, a key aspect of human collective behaviour. Thus, in addition to simulating individual human behaviour, AI-powered artificial societies may advance social science research by allowing researchers to simulate nuanced aspects of collective behaviour.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a linked simulation optimization (SO) model is presented for identification of groundwater contaminant sources. The SO model consists of two steps namely, simulation and optimization. The simulation step entails developing a groundwater contaminant transport model in which the advection-dispersion-reaction equation (ADRE) is solved for predicting the concentration of the contaminant. The system parameters (hydraulic conductivity, dispersivity, etc.) and control variables (pumping, recharge, etc.,) are given as model inputs. A meshless technique called the meshless Local Radial Point Interpolation Method (LRPIM) is employed to solve the contaminant transport equation. The simulation model is linked with three different swarm intelligence-based optimization models namely, teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO), grey wolf optimization (GWO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to form three SO models namely LRPIM-PSO, LRPIM-GWO and LRPIM-TLBO. The SO model minimizes the difference between the predicted and observed concentrations to determine the unknown source locations and release histories. The applicability of the developed SO models for source identification (SI) is demonstrated with a hypothetical and real aquifer problems to identify the groundwater contaminant sources. All the 3 models are able to locate the sources and release histories satisfactorily. However, the LRPIM-TLBO has been found to be more accurate followed by LRPIM-PSO and LRPIM-GWO.",

    "abstract": "Despite cystoscopy plays an important role in bladder tumors diagnosis, it often falls short in flat cancerous tissue and minuscule satellite lesions. It can easily lead to a missed diagnosis by the urologist, which can lead to a swift tumor regrowth following transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT). Therefore, we developed a deep learning-based intelligent diagnosis system for early bladder cancer to improve the identification rate of early bladder tumors.\nVideo data from 273 bladder cancer patients who underwent TURBT at Zhongnan Hospital were collected. The dataset was carefully annotated by urologists to clearly define tumor boundaries. Subsequently, we developed a new bladder tumor segmentation network (BTS-Net) based on transformer to accurately diagnose early-stage bladder cancer lesions.\nOur experiments demonstrate that the BTS-Net we developed has outperformed other method on the external B validation dataset, achieving a MPrecision of 91.39%, a MRecall of 95.71%, a MIoU of 88.18% and an F1-score of 93.18%. The BTS-Net showed high accuracy with real-time processing speed at 23 fps.\nMissed detection of satellite lesions in early bladder tumors often leads to tumor recurrence. Our BTS-Net is capable of segmenting all potential satellite lesions in surgical videos, without the need for complex professional equipment. This AI-assisted diagnosis system has the potential to improve surgical outcomes by ensuring comprehensive treatment of all tumor-related areas during TURBT.",

    "abstract": "The increasing development of technology has led to the increase of digital data in various fields, such as medication-related texts. Sentiment Analysis (SA) in medication is essential to give clinicians insights into patients' feedback about the treatment procedure. Therefore, this study intends to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to predict patients' sentiments. This study used a large medication review dataset to perform a SA of medications. Three scenarios were considered for classification, including two, three, and ten classes. The Word2Vec algorithm and pre-trained word embeddings, including the general and clinical domains, were utilized in model development. Seven Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models were developed for various scenarios. The best hyperparameters for all models were fine-tuned. Moreover, two ensemble learning models were developed from the proposed ML and DL models. For the first time, a technique was implemented to interpret the results for explainability and interpretability. The results showed that the developed deep ensemble model (DL_ENS), using PubMed and PMC, as pre-trained word embedding representation, achieved the best results, with accuracy and F1-Score of 92.96% and 92.27% in two classes, 92.18% and 88.50 in three classes, and 90.31% and 67.07% in ten classes, respectively. Combining DL models and developing a DL_ENS with clinical domain pre-trained word embedding representation can accurately predict classes and scores of patients' sentiments about medications compared to previous studies on the same dataset. Due to the transparency in decision-making, our DL_ENS model can be used as an auxiliary tool to help clinicians prescribe medications.",

    "abstract": "With breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in academic research has increased tremendously. Models such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) are used by researchers in literature review, abstract screening, and manuscript drafting. However, these models also present the attendant challenge of providing ethically questionable scientific information. Our study provides a snapshot of global researchers' perception of current trends and future impacts of LLMs in research. Using a cross-sectional design, we surveyed 226 medical and paramedical researchers from 59 countries across 65 specialties, trained in the Global Clinical Scholars' Research Training certificate program of Harvard Medical School between 2020 and 2024. Majority (57.5%) of these participants practiced in an academic setting with a median of 7 (2,18) PubMed Indexed published articles. 198 respondents (87.6%) were aware of LLMs and those who were aware had higher number of publications (p\u2009<\u20090.001). 18.7% of the respondents who were aware (n\u2009=\u200937) had previously used LLMs in publications especially for grammatical errors and formatting (64.9%); however, most (40.5%) did not acknowledge its use in their papers. 50.8% of aware respondents (n\u2009=\u200995) predicted an overall positive future impact of LLMs while 32.6% were unsure of its scope. 52% of aware respondents (n\u2009=\u2009102) believed that LLMs would have a major impact in areas such as grammatical errors and formatting (66.3%), revision and editing (57.2%), writing (57.2%) and literature review (54.2%). 58.1% of aware respondents were opined that journals should allow for use of AI in research and 78.3% believed that regulations should be put in place to avoid its abuse. Seeing the perception of researchers towards LLMs and the significant association between awareness of LLMs and number of published works, we emphasize the importance of developing comprehensive guidelines and ethical framework to govern the use of AI in academic research and address the current challenges.",

    "abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven effective in mRNA delivery, as evidenced by COVID-19 vaccines. Its key ingredient, ionizable lipids, is traditionally optimized by inefficient and costly experimental screening. This study leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual screening to facilitate the rational design of ionizable lipids by predicting two key properties of LNPs, apparent pKa and mRNA delivery efficiency. Nearly 20 million ionizable lipids were evaluated through two iterations of AI-driven generation and screening, yielding three and six new molecules, respectively. In mouse test validation, one lipid from the initial iteration, featuring a benzene ring, demonstrated performance comparable to the control DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3). Notably, all six lipids from the second iteration equaled or outperformed MC3, with one exhibiting efficacy akin to a superior control lipid SM-102. Furthermore, the AI model is interpretable in structure-activity relationships.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma is a pathologically irreversible eye illness in the realm of ophthalmic diseases. Because it is difficult to detect concealed and non-obvious progressive changes, clinical diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma is extremely challenging. At the same time, screening and monitoring for glaucoma disease progression are crucial. Artificial intelligence technology has advanced rapidly in all fields, particularly medicine, thanks to ongoing in-depth study and algorithm extension. Simultaneously, research and applications of machine learning and deep learning in the field of glaucoma are fast evolving. Artificial intelligence, with its numerous advantages, will raise the accuracy and efficiency of glaucoma screening and diagnosis to new heights, as well as significantly cut the cost of diagnosis and treatment for the majority of patients. This review summarizes the relevant applications of artificial intelligence in the screening and diagnosis of glaucoma, as well as reflects deeply on the limitations and difficulties of the current application of artificial intelligence in the field of glaucoma, and presents promising prospects and expectations for the application of artificial intelligence in other eye diseases such as glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "It is known that leprosy is a socially determined disease, but most studies using spatial analysis have not considered the vulnerabilities present in these territories.\nTo measure the association between social vulnerability and the burden of leprosy in the urban space of Cuiab\u00e1.\nEcological study, carried out in Cuiab\u00e1, Brazil. Diagnosed cases of leprosy were surveyed through the Notifiable Diseases Information System, from 2008 to 2018. The spatial scan statistics technique of leprosy cases per each Human Development Unit was applied. Social vulnerability was measured based on the Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI), education level and average per capita income. For the spatial correlation between vulnerability and leprosy, Global and local bivariate Moran's index was used.\n8389 cases of leprosy were georeferenced, the majority being male (58%), 30% of cases were not evaluated for degree of physical disability. One of the spatial scan clusters had a relative risk (RR) of 6.93 (95% CI 6.49-7.4), and another had 1360 cases with RR 1.71 (95% CI 1.62-1.82). The bivariate global autocorrelation of Moran's index for MHDI was 0.579, observing 1 High-High in the East region and 1 in South, for education the index was 0.429, 2 High-High in the East and 1 in the South, and 0.145 for average per capita income, 1 High-High in the East.\nThere was a spatial association between leprosy cases and territories with low MHDI, having a percentage of the population without schooling and/or with low income. The study advances knowledge by presenting characteristics of territories most affected by leprosy, verifying the spatial correlation of the disease with the recurrent socioeconomic characteristics in these territories.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation is a common occurrence in clinical ICU patients and presents significant challenges for patient care and resource allocation. Predicting prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation is crucial for improving patient outcomes, preventing ventilator-associated complications, and guiding targeted clinical interventions. However, specific tools for predicting prolonged mechanical ventilation among ICU patients, particularly those with critical orthopaedic trauma, are currently lacking. The purpose of the study was to establish and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) platform to assess the prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation among patients with critical orthopaedic trauma.\nThis study analyzed 1400 patients with critical orthopaedic trauma who received mechanical ventilation, and the prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation was defined as not weaning from mechanical ventilation for \u2267\u20097 days. Patients were randomly classified into a training cohort and a validation cohort based on the ratio of 8:2. Patients in the training cohort were used to establish models using machine learning techniques, including logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting machine (eXGBM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), whereas patients in the validation cohort were used to validate these models. The prediction performance of these models was evaluated using discrimination and calibration. A scoring system was used to comprehensively assess and compare the prediction performance of the models, based on ten evaluation metrics. External validation of the model was performed in 122 patients with critical orthopaedic trauma from a university teaching hospital. Furthermore, the optimal model was deployed as an AI calculator, which was accessible online, to assess the risk of prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation.\nAmong the developed models, the eXGBM model had the highest score of 50, followed by the LightGBM model (48) and the RF model (37). In detail, the eXGBM model outperformed other models in terms of recall (0.892), Brier score (0.088), log loss (0.291), and calibration slope (0.999), and the model was the second best in terms of area under the curve value (0.949, 95%: 0.933-0.961), accuracy (0.871), F1 score (0.873), and discrimination slope (0.647). The SHAP revealed that the most important five features were respiratory rate, lower limb fracture, glucose, PaO2, and PaCO2. External validation of the eXGBM model also demonstrated favorable prediction performance, with an AUC value of 0.893 (95%CI: 0.819-0.967). The eXGBM model was successfully deployed as an AI platform, which was at https://prolongedmechanicalventilation-lqsfm6ecky6dpd4ybkvohu.streamlit.app/ . By simply clicking the link and inputting features, users were able to obtain the risk of experiencing prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation for individuals. Based on the risk of prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation, patients were stratified into the high-risk or the low-risk groups, and corresponding therapeutic interventions were recommended, accordingly.\nThe AI model shows potential as a valuable tool for stratifying patients with a high risk of prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation. The AI model may offer a promising approach for optimizing patient care and resource allocation in critical care settings.\nNot applicable.",

    "abstract": "The primary objective of this study is to investigate various applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and statistical methodologies for analyzing and managing peritoneal metastases (PM) caused by gastrointestinal cancers.\nRelevant keywords and search criteria were comprehensively researched on PubMed and Google Scholar to identify articles and reviews related to the topic. The AI approaches considered were conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, and the relevant statistical approaches included biostatistics and logistic models.\nThe systematic literature review yielded nearly 30 articles meeting the predefined criteria. Analyses of these studies showed that AI methodologies consistently outperformed traditional statistical approaches. In the AI approaches, DL consistently produced the most precise results, while classical ML demonstrated varied performance but maintained high predictive accuracy. The sample size was the recurring factor that increased the accuracy of the predictions for models of the same type.\nAI and statistical approaches can detect PM developing among patients with gastrointestinal cancers. Therefore, if clinicians integrated these approaches into diagnostics and prognostics, they could better analyze and manage PM, enhancing clinical decision-making and patients' outcomes. Collaboration across multiple institutions would also help in standardizing methods for data collection and allowing consistent results.",

    "abstract": "In this comprehensive review, we delve into the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in refining the application of multi-omics and spatial multi-omics within the realm of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) research. We scrutinized the current landscape of multi-omics and spatial multi-omics technologies, accentuating their combined potential with AI to provide unparalleled insights into the molecular intricacies and spatial heterogeneity inherent to DLBCL. Despite current progress, we acknowledge the hurdles that impede the full utilization of these technologies, such as the integration and sophisticated analysis of complex datasets, the necessity for standardized protocols, the reproducibility of findings, and the interpretation of their biological significance. We proceeded to pinpoint crucial research voids and advocated for a trajectory that incorporates the development of advanced AI-driven data integration and analytical frameworks. The evolution of these technologies is crucial for enhancing resolution and depth in multi-omics studies. We also emphasized the importance of amassing extensive, meticulously annotated multi-omics datasets and fostering translational research efforts to connect laboratory discoveries with clinical applications seamlessly. Our review concluded that the synergistic integration of multi-omics, spatial multi-omics, and AI holds immense promise for propelling precision medicine forward in DLBCL. By surmounting the present challenges and steering towards the outlined futuristic pathways, we can harness these potent investigative tools to decipher the molecular and spatial conundrums of DLBCL. This will pave the way for refined diagnostic precision, nuanced risk stratification, and individualized therapeutic regimens, ushering in a new era of patient-centric oncology care.",

    "abstract": "China's \"14th Five-Year Plan\" proposes the construction of a \"Digital China,\" posing the challenge of digital transformation to coal mining enterprises. It is critical to compare the effectiveness of investing in digital devices with that of human capital. This study establishes a structural equation model based on the 'regulation-situation-behavior' theoretical framework. The model, developed through in-depth empirical analysis of enterprises, captures the relationships between exogenous and endogenous latent variables. The primary factors influencing both the active and passive safety behaviors of coal miners are discussed. The micro-mechanisms of human interaction with digital intelligence equipment are analyzed. The findings indicate that, in terms of overall utility value, investment in Intelligent surveillance management generates a total utility value that is 4.292 times higher than that of investment in team demonstration management. This disparity is primarily attributed to the significant positive impact that Intelligent surveillance management exerts on the active safety behavior of coal miners. Specifically, it influences miners' safety behavior through the dual effects of situational promotion focus and situational prevention focus, whereas team demonstration management solely utilizes situational promotion focus. Additionally, the investigation reveals that miners attach significant importance to the role of instant feedback and continuous monitoring in Intelligent surveillance management. Consequently, coal mining enterprises should prioritize investing in digital intelligence supervision systems with real-time, full-time, and full-coverage capabilities. They should also focus on improving education, publicity, and training related to Intelligent surveillance management. These approaches can effectively enhance the digital, intelligent, safe and sustainable development capabilities of coal mines.",

    "abstract": "Background\u00a0 The generation of innovative research ideas is crucial to advancing the field of medicine. As physicians face increasingly demanding clinical schedules, it is important to identify tools that may expedite the research process. Artificial intelligence may offer a promising solution by enabling the efficient generation of novel research ideas. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using artificial intelligence to build upon existing knowledge by generating innovative research questions.\u00a0 Methods\u00a0 A comparative evaluation study was conducted to assess the ability of AI models to generate novel research questions. The prompt \"research ideas for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis\" was input\u00a0into ChatGPT 3.5, Gemini 1.5, Copilot, and Llama 3. This resulted in an output of several research questions ranging from 10 questions to 14 questions. A keyword-friendly modified version of the AI-generated responses was searched in the PubMed database. Results were limited to manuscripts published in the English language from the year 2000 to the present. Each response was then cross-referenced to the PubMed search results and assigned an originality score of 0-5, with 0 being the most original and 5 being not original at all, by adding one numerical value for each paper already published on the topic. The mean originality scores were calculated manually by summing the originality scores from all the responses from each AI model\u00a0and then dividing that sum by the respective number of prompts generated by the AI. The standard deviation of the originality scores for each AI was calculated using the standard deviation function (STDEV) function in Google Sheets (Google, Mountain View, California). Each AI was also evaluated on its percent novelty, the percentage of total generated responses that yielded an originality score of 0 when searched in PubMed.\u00a0 Results\u00a0 Each AI produced varying numbers of research prompts that were inputted into PubMed. The mean originality scores for ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and Llama were 4.2 \u00b1 1.9, 4.1 \u00b1 1.3, 4.0 \u00b1 1.6, and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7, respectively. Of ChatGPT's 12 prompts, 16.67% were completely novel (no prior research had been conducted on the topic provided by the AI model). 10.00% of Copilot's 10 prompts were completely novel, and 8.33% of Llama's 12 prompts were completely novel. None of Gemini's fourteen responses yielded an originality score of 0.\u00a0 Conclusions\u00a0 Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT, Llama, and Copilot are capable of generating novel ideas in orthopaedics research. As these models continue to evolve and become even more refined with time, physicians and scientists should consider incorporating them when brainstorming and planning their research studies.",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading global cause of morbidity and mortality, underscoring the need for effective cardiovascular risk stratification and preventive strategies. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring, traditionally performed using electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated cardiac computed tomography (CT) scans, has been widely validated as a robust tool for assessing cardiovascular risk. However, its application has been largely limited to high-risk populations due to the costs, technical requirements, and limited accessibility of cardiac CT scans. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have introduced transformative opportunities to extend CAC detection to noncardiac CT scans, such as those performed for lung cancer screening, enabling broader and more accessible cardiovascular screening. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of AI-driven CAC detection, examining various types of AI models for CAC detection, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and U-Net architectures, and exploring the clinical, operational, and ethical implications of incorporating these technologies into routine practice. Technical challenges, including imaging variability, data privacy, and model bias, are discussed alongside essential areas for further research, such as standardization and validation across diverse populations. By leveraging widely available imaging data, AI-enabled CAC detection has the potential to advance preventive cardiology, supporting earlier risk identification, optimizing healthcare resources, and improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is a hot topic in the world of medicine. AI may be useful in identifying and sizing polyps, which influence surveillance intervals. Therefore, we examined polyp size estimation by AI using a survey study. Methods A survey study was performed using a phantom colon model. Eleven videos were produced in the colon phantom using a colonoscope. Gastroenterologists were compared to a new AI system (Argus) for sizing polyps and their impact on surveillance intervals. Results Eleven gastroenterologists completed the survey with a mean age of 51.1 \u00b1 8.1 years and an average of 19.3 \u00b1 10 years of experience. Mean accuracy rates for gastroenterologists were 76% \u00b1 0.1% (range 54-89%) compared to 96% \u00b1 0.05% for Argus. Endoscopists estimated polyp size within \u00b1 1 mm 44 times (36%) versus 9 times (82%) with Argus. Endoscopists' surveillance recommendations were significantly more often inappropriate compared to Argus (34 vs 0). The interval of next colonoscopy was too short for 27 endoscopists (22%) and too long for seven endoscopists (6%). Conclusions AI appears to be more accurate in estimating polyp size than experienced endoscopists. Given the potential impact on surveillance intervals, AI may result in cost savings.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning based applications are thought to impact the practice of healthcare by transforming diagnostic patient management approaches. However, domain knowledge, clinical and coding expertise are likely the biggest challenge and a substantial barrier in developing practical AI models. Most informatics and AI experts are not familiar with the nuances in medicine, and most doctors are not efficient coders. To address this barrier, a few \"no-code\" AI platforms are emerging. They enable medical professionals to create AI models without coding skills. This study examines Teachable Machine\u2122, a no-code AI platform, to classify white blood cells into the five common WBC types. Training data from publicly available datasets were used, and model accuracy was improved by fine-tuning hyperparameters. Sensitivity, precision, and F1 score calculations evaluated model performance, and independent datasets were employed for testing. Several factors that influence the performance of the model were tested. The model achieved 97% accuracy in classifying white blood cells, with high sensitivity and precision. Independent validation supported its potential for further development. This is the first study that demonstrates the value of a free no-code algorithm based AI platforms use in hematopathology using authentic datasets for training. It opens an opportunity for the healthcare professionals to get hands-on experience with AI and to create practical AI models without coding expertise.",

    "abstract": "Atomic simulations aim to understand and predict complex physical phenomena, the success of which relies largely on the accuracy of the potential energy surface description and the efficiency to capture important rare events. LASP software (large-scale atomic simulation with a Neural Network Potential), released in 2018, incorporates the key ingredients to fulfill the ultimate goal of atomic simulations by combining advanced neural network potentials with efficient global optimization methods. This review introduces the recent development of the software along two main streams, namely, higher intelligence and more automation, to solve complex material and reaction problems. The latest version of LASP (LASP 3.7) features the global many-body function corrected neural network (G-MBNN) to improve the PES accuracy with low cost, which achieves a linear scaling efficiency for large-scale atomic simulations. The key functionalities of LASP are updated to incorporate (i) the ASOP and ML-interface methods for finding complex surface and interface structures under grand canonic conditions; (ii) the ML-TS and MMLPS methods to identify the lowest energy reaction pathway. With these powerful functionalities, LASP now serves as an intelligent data generator to create computational databases for end users. We exemplify the recent LASP database construction in zeolite and the metal-ligand properties for a new catalyst design.",

    "abstract": "The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy has witnessed significant progress and promising results in recent years worldwide. From 2019 to 2023, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy has released multiple guidelines/consensus with recommendations on integrating AI for detecting and classifying lesions in practical endoscopy. In Vietnam, since 2019, several preliminary studies have been conducted to develop AI algorithms for GI endoscopy, focusing on lesion detection. These studies have yielded high accuracy results ranging from 86% to 92%. For upper GI endoscopy, ongoing research directions comprise image quality assessment, detection of anatomical landmarks, simulating image-enhanced endoscopy, and semi-automated tools supporting the delineation of GI lesions on endoscopic images. For lower GI endoscopy, most studies focus on developing AI algorithms for colorectal polyps' detection and classification based on the risk of malignancy. In conclusion, the application of AI in this field represents a promising research direction, presenting challenges and opportunities for real-world implementation within the Vietnamese healthcare context.",

    "abstract": "In-vitro fertilization (IVF) has been a transformative advancement in assisted reproductive technology. However, success rates remain suboptimal, with only about one-third of cycles resulting in pregnancy and fewer leading to live births. This narrative review explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) to enhance various stages of the IVF process. Personalization of ovarian stimulation protocols, gamete selection, and embryo annotation and selection are critical areas where AI may benefit significantly. AI-driven tools can analyze vast datasets to predict optimal stimulation protocols, potentially improving oocyte quality and fertilization rates. In sperm and oocyte quality assessment, AI can offer precise, objective analyses, reducing subjectivity and standardizing evaluations. In embryo selection, AI can analyze time-lapse imaging and morphological data to support the prediction of embryo viability, potentially aiding implantation outcomes. However, the role of AI in improving clinical outcomes remains to be confirmed by large-scale, well-designed clinical trials. Additionally, AI has the potential to enhance quality control and workflow optimization within IVF laboratories by continuously monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) and facilitating efficient resource utilization. Ethical considerations, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and fairness, are paramount for the responsible implementation of AI in IVF. Future research should prioritize validating AI tools in diverse clinical settings, ensuring their applicability and reliability. Collaboration among AI experts, clinicians, and embryologists is essential to drive innovation and improve outcomes in assisted reproduction. AI's integration into IVF holds promise for advancing patient care, but its clinical potential requires careful evaluation and ongoing refinement.",

    "abstract": "Failure to predict stroke promptly may lead to delayed treatment, causing severe consequences like permanent neurological damage or death. Early detection using deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models can enhance patient outcomes and mitigate the long-term effects of strokes. The aim of this study is to compare these models, exploring their efficacy in predicting stroke. This study analyzed a dataset comprising 663 records from patients hospitalized at Hazrat Rasool Akram Hospital in Tehran, Iran, including 401 healthy individuals and 262 stroke patients. A total of eight established ML (SVM, XGB, KNN, RF) and DL (DNN, FNN, LSTM, CNN) models were utilized to predict stroke. Techniques such as 10-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were implemented to prevent overfitting. The study also focused on interpretability through Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). The evaluation of model's performance was based on accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1-score, and ROC curve metrics. Among DL models, LSTM showed superior sensitivity at 96.15%, while FNN exhibited better specificity (96.0%), accuracy (96.0%), F1-score (95.0%), and ROC (98.0%) among DL models. For ML models, RF displayed higher sensitivity (99.9%), accuracy (99.0%), specificity (100%), F1-score (99.0%), and ROC (99.9%). Overall, RF outperformed all models, while DL models surpassed ML models in most metrics except for RF. DL models (CNN, LSTM, DNN, FNN) achieved sensitivities from 93.0 to 96.15%, specificities from 80.0 to 96.0%, accuracies from 92.0 to 96.0%, F1-scores from 87.34 to 95.0%, and ROC scores from 95.0 to 98.0%. In contrast, ML models (KNN, XGB, SVM) showed sensitivities between 29.0% and 94.0%, specificities between 89.47% and 96.0%, accuracies between 71.0% and 95.0%, F1-scores between 44.0% and 95.0%, and ROC scores between 64.0% and 95.0%. This study demonstrates the efficacy of DL and ML models in predicting stroke, with the RF models outperforming all others in key metrics. While DL models generally surpassed ML models, RF's exceptional performance highlights the potential of combining these technologies for early stroke detection, significantly improving patient outcomes by preventing severe consequences like permanent neurological damage or death.",

    "abstract": "The randomness and volatility of existing clean energy sources have increased the complexity of grid scheduling. To address this issue, this work proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) empowered method based on the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) big data platform, focusing on multi-objective scheduling optimization for clean energy. This work employs a combination of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) to enhance grid scheduling efficiency and clean energy utilization. First, the work analyzes the complexity and uncertainty challenges faced in clean energy scheduling within the current power system, highlighting the limitations of traditional methods in handling multi-objective optimization and real-time response. Consequently, the work introduces the ESG big data platform and leverages its abundant data resources and computational power to improve the scheduling decision-making process. Next, PSO is used for initial scheduling optimization and a mathematical model for clean energy scheduling optimization is constructed. To further enhance the dynamic response capability of the scheduling process, this work designs a dual-layer architecture. Among this architecture, DQN is responsible for adjusting the PSO initially optimized scheduling plan based on real-time data during the actual scheduling process, adapting it to the instantaneous change demand and renewable energy output characteristics. Finally, to verify the model's effectiveness, this work conducts simulation analyses using real data from the state grid ESG big data platform. The results indicate that this method significantly improves clean energy utilization, increasing it from 62.4% (with traditional methods) to 87.7%, while reducing scheduling costs by 22%. With the increase in communication delay, the generation time of scheduling instruction increases significantly. This is because the algorithm needs to wait longer to receive the complete grid status information, which affects the generation speed of scheduling instructions. Moreover, this method demonstrates good adaptability and stability under different load demands and clean energy supply conditions. This work introduces a novel and efficient method for clean energy scheduling optimization by integrating PSO and DQN. It contributes to the overall improvement of clean energy utilization within the State Grid and provides a theoretical and empirical foundation for further research in related fields.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the optimal operating points of adult-oriented artificial intelligence (AI) software differ for pediatric chest radiographs and to assess its diagnostic performance. Chest radiographs from patients under 19 years old, collected between March and November 2021, were divided into test and exploring sets. A commercial adult-oriented AI software was utilized to detect lung lesions, including pneumothorax, consolidation, nodule, and pleural effusion, using a standard operating point of 15%. A pediatric radiologist reviewed the radiographs to establish ground truth for lesion presence. To determine the optimal operating points, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted, varying thresholds to balance sensitivity and specificity by lesion type, age group, and imaging method. The test set (4,727 chest radiographs, mean 7.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 years) and exploring set (2,630 radiographs, mean 5.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.0 years) yielded optimal operating points of 11% for pneumothorax, 14% for consolidation, 15% for nodules, and 6% for pleural effusion. Using a 3% operating point improved pneumothorax sensitivity for children under 2 years, portable radiographs, and anteroposterior projections. Therefore, optimizing operating points of AI based on lesion type, age, and imaging method could improve diagnostic performance for pediatric chest radiographs, building on adult-oriented AI as a foundation.",

    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), characterized by its ability to generate diverse forms of content including text, images, video and audio, has revolutionized many fields, including medical education. Generative AI leverages machine learning to create diverse content, enabling personalized learning, enhancing resource accessibility, and facilitating interactive case studies. This narrative review explores the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into orthopedic education and training, highlighting its potential, current challenges, and future trajectory. A review of recent literature was conducted to evaluate the current applications, identify potential benefits, and outline limitations of integrating generative AI in orthopedic education. Key findings indicate that generative AI holds substantial promise in enhancing orthopedic training through its various applications such as providing real-time explanations, adaptive learning materials tailored to individual student's specific needs, and immersive virtual simulations. However, despite its potential, the integration of generative AI into orthopedic education faces significant issues such as accuracy, bias, inconsistent outputs, ethical and regulatory concerns and the critical need for human oversight. Although generative AI models such as ChatGPT and others have shown impressive capabilities, their current performance on orthopedic exams remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for further development to match the complexity of clinical reasoning and knowledge application. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges through ongoing research, optimizing generative AI models for medical content, exploring best practices for ethical AI usage, curriculum integration and evaluating the long-term impact of these technologies on learning outcomes. By expanding AI's knowledge base, refining its ability to interpret clinical images, and ensuring reliable, unbiased outputs, generative AI holds the potential to revolutionize orthopedic education. This work aims to provides a framework for incorporating generative AI into orthopedic curricula to create a more effective, engaging, and adaptive learning environment for future orthopedic practitioners.",

    "abstract": "Medical narratives are fundamental to the correct identification of a patient's health condition. This is not only because it describes the patient's situation. It also contains relevant information about the patient's context and health state evolution. Narratives are usually vague and cannot be categorized easily. On the other hand, once the patient's situation is correctly identified based on a narrative, it is then possible to map the patient's situation into precise classification schemas and ontologies that are machine-readable. To this end, language models can be trained to read and extract elements from these narratives. However, the main problem is the lack of data for model identification and model training in languages other than English. First, gold standard annotations are usually not available due to the high level of data protection for patient data. Second, gold standard annotations (if available) are difficult to access. Alternative available data, like MIMIC (Sci Data 3:1, 2016) is written in English and for specific patient conditions like intensive care. Thus, when model training is required for other types of patients, like oncology (and not intensive care), this could lead to bias. To facilitate clinical narrative model training, a method for creating high-quality synthetic narratives is needed.\nWe devised workflows based on generative AI methods to synthesize narratives in the German language to avoid the disclosure of patient's health data. Since we required highly realistic narratives, we generated prompts, written with high-quality medical terminology, asking for clinical narratives containing both a main and co-disease. The frequency of distribution of both the main and co-disease was extracted from the hospital's structured data, such that the synthetic narratives reflect the disease distribution among the patient's cohort. In order to validate the quality of the synthetic narratives, we annotated them to train a Named Entity Recognition (NER) algorithm. According to our assumptions, the validation of this system implies that the synthesized data used for its training are of acceptable quality.\nWe report precision, recall and F1 score for the NER model while also considering metrics that take into account both exact and partial entity matches. Trained models are cautious, with a precision up to 0.8 for Entity Type match metric and a F1 score of 0.3.\nDespite its inherent limitations, this technology has the potential to allow data interoperability by using encoded diseases across languages and regions without compromising data safety. Additionally, it facilitates the synthesis of unstructured patient data. In this way, the identification and training of models can be accelerated. We believe that this method may be able to generate discharge letters for any combination of main and co-diseases, which will significantly reduce the amount of time spent writing these letters by healthcare professionals.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) can quantitatively evaluate histopathological findings. The aim was to measure NS in ESCC using AI and elucidate its clinical significance. We investigated the relationship between NS assessed by AI and prognosis in 138 patients with ESCC who underwent curative esophagectomy. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from the deepest tumor sections were digitized. Using HALO-AI DenseNet v2, we created a deep learning classifier that identified tumor cells with an NS area >20 \u03bcm",

    "abstract": "Past work relates intelligence quotient (IQ) to risk for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among soldiers. We gathered data over multiple deployments to assess how IQ relates to the rate of symptom development both directly and through increasing the risk for traumatic combat exposure.\nMale infantry soldiers from a maneuver brigade (N\u202f=\u202f582) were followed over the 3-year period of their mandatory military service. Data were collected at 3-time-points: 1) shortly after enlistment and before deployment; 2) about 15 months into the service following one deployment, and another year later following additional deployments. IQ was measured before recruitment into the military; PTSD symptoms and combat exposure were measured at each time-point.\nLower general IQ, and in particular lower abstract reasoning capabilities, related to steeper increases in PTSD symptoms, TIME\u00d7IQ=\u202f-.05, SE=\u202f.02, t(442.79)\u202f=\u202f-3.255, p\u202f<\u202f.01, controlling for the effect of pre-military traumatic experience. This relation was partly mediated by combat exposure, Effect=\u202f-.04, BootSE=\u202f.01, 95\u202f% CI [-.06, -.02].\nThe results identify important risk factors for PTSD that can inform approaches to PTSD mitigation in the military and other organizations.

    "abstract": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has caught the attention of the world as it challenges the status quo on human operations. As AI has dramatically impacted education, healthcare, industry, and economics, a Catholic ethical study of human dignity in the context of AI in healthcare is presented in this article. The debates regarding whether AI will usher well or doom the dignity of humankind are occasioned by increasing developments of technology in patient care and medical decision-making. This paper draws from Catholic ethics, especially the concepts of inherent human dignity, the sanctity of human life, and morality in the medical field. It talks about using AI to upgrade healthcare outcomes without losing the essential humanity of human dignity in medical practice. It also touches on the most likely ethical issues: the morality of AI-related decisions and the depersonalization of health care. Finally, it provides a framework that brings AI development in tandem with a Catholic vision of human dignity and supports a healthcare system that caters to the common good but correctly respects the irreplaceable value of the human person and highlights moral responsibility.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted design model that combines Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance innovation and efficiency in cultural and creative product design. By introducing AI-driven decision support, the model streamlines the design workflow and significantly improves design quality. The study establishes a comprehensive framework and applies the model to four distinct design tasks, with extensive experiments validating its performance. Key factors, including creativity, cultural adaptability, and practical application, are evaluated through structured surveys and expert feedback. The results reveal that the VAE\u2009+\u2009RL model surpasses alternative approaches across multiple criteria. Highlights include a user satisfaction rate of 95%, a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) score of 0.92, model accuracy of 93%, and a loss reduction to 0.07. These findings confirm the model's superiority in generating high-quality designs and achieving high user satisfaction. Additionally, the model exhibits strong generalization capabilities and operational efficiency, offering valuable insights and data support for future advancements in cultural product design technology.",

    "abstract": "The methodology in colon polyp labeling in establishing database for ma-chine learning is not well-described and standardized. We aimed to find out the best annotation method to generate the most accurate model in polyp detection.\n3542 colonoscopy polyp images were obtained from endoscopy database of a tertiary medical center. Two experienced endoscopists manually annotated the polyp with (1) exact outline segmentation and (2) using a standard rectangle box close to the polyp margin, and extending 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% longer in both width and length of the standard rectangle for AI modeling setup. The images were randomly divided into training and validation sets in 4:1 ratio. U-Net convolutional network architecture was used to develop automatic segmentation machine learning model. Another unrelated verification set was established to evaluate the performance of polyp detection by different segmentation methods.\nExtending the bounding box to 20% of the polyp margin represented the best performance in accuracy (95.42%), sensitivity (94.84%) and F1-score (95.41%). Exact outline segmentation model showed the excellent performance in sensitivity (99.6%) and the worst precision (77.47%). The 20% model was the best among the 6 models. (confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a00.957-0.985; AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.971).\nLabelling methodology affect the predictability of AI model in polyp detection. Extending the bounding box to 20% of the polyp margin would result in the best polyp detection predictive model based on AUC data. It is mandatory to establish a standardized way in colon polyp labeling for comparison of the precision of different AI models.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), a branch of computer science, has been of growing research interest since its introduction to healthcare disciplines in the 1970s. Research has demonstrated that the application of such technologies has allowed for greater task accuracy and efficiency in medical disciplines such as diagnostics, treatment protocols and clinical decision-making. Application in pharmacy practice is reportedly narrower in scope; with greater emphasis placed on stock management and day-to-day function optimisation than enhancing patient outcomes. Despite this, new studies are underway to explore how AI technologies may be utilised in areas such as pharmacist interventions, medication adherence, and personalised medicine. Objective/s: The aim of this study was to identify current use of AI in measuring performance outcomes in pharmacy practice.\nA scoping review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). A comprehensive literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, IPA (International Pharmaceutical Abstracts), and Web of Science databases for articles published between January 1, 2018 to September 11, 2023, relevant to the aim. The final search strategy included the following terms: (\"artificial intelligence\") AND (\"pharmacy\" OR \"pharmacist\" OR \"pharmaceutical service\" OR \"pharmacy service\"). Reference lists of identified review articles were also screened.\nThe literature search identified 560 studies, of which seven met the inclusion criteria. These studies described the use of AI in pharmacy practice. All seven studies utilised models derived from machine learning AI techniques. AI identification of prescriptions requiring pharmacist intervention was the most frequent (n\u00a0=\u00a04), followed by screening services (n\u00a0=\u00a02), and patient-facing mobile applications (n\u00a0=\u00a01). These results indicated a workflow- and productivity-focused application of AI within current pharmacy practice, with minimal intention for direct patient health outcome improvement. Despite this, the review also revealed AI's potential in data collation and analytics to aid in pharmacist contribution towards the healthcare team and improvement of health outcomes.\nThis scoping review has identified, from the literature available, three main areas of focus, (1) identification and classification of atypical or inappropriate medication orders, (2) improving efficiency of mass screening services, and (3) improving adherence and quality use of medicines. It also identified gaps in AI's current utility within the profession and its potential for day-to-day practice, as our understanding of general AI techniques continues to advance.",

    "abstract": "Private-part skin diseases (PPSDs) can cause a patient's stigma, which may hinder the early diagnosis of these diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an effective tool to improve the early diagnosis of PPSDs, especially in preventing the deterioration of skin tumors in private parts such as Paget disease. However, to our knowledge, there is currently no research on using AI to identify PPSDs due to the complex backgrounds of the lesion areas and the challenges in data collection.\nThis study aimed to develop and evaluate an AI-aided diagnosis system for the detection and classification of PPSDs: aiding patients in self-screening and supporting dermatologists' diagnostic enhancement.\nIn this decision analytical modeling study, a 2-stage AI-aided diagnosis system was developed to classify PPSDs. In the first stage, a multitask detection network was trained to automatically detect and classify skin lesions (type, color, and shape). In the second stage, we proposed a knowledge graph based on dermatology expertise and constructed a decision network to classify seven PPSDs (condyloma acuminatum, Paget disease, eczema, pearly penile papules, genital herpes, syphilis, and Bowen disease). A reader study with 13 dermatologists of different experience levels was conducted. Dermatologists were asked to classify the testing cohort under reading room conditions, first without and then with system support. This AI-aided diagnostic study used the data of 635 patients from two institutes between July 2019 and April 2022. The data of Institute 1 contained 2701 skin lesion samples from 520 patients, which were used for the training of the multitask detection network in the first stage. In addition, the data of Institute 2 consisted of 115 clinical images and the corresponding medical records, which were used for the test of the whole 2-stage AI-aided diagnosis system.\nOn the test data of Institute 2, the proposed system achieved the average precision, recall, and F\nIn this study, we constructed the first skin-lesion-based dataset and developed the first AI-aided diagnosis system for PPSDs. This system provides the final diagnosis result by simulating the diagnostic process of dermatologists. Compared with existing advanced algorithms, this system is more accurate in identifying PPSDs. Overall, our system can not only help patients achieve self-screening and alleviate their stigma but also assist dermatologists in diagnosing PPSDs.",

    "abstract": "The projected increase from 58 million older adults in 2022 to 82 million by 2050 in the United States highlights the urgency of preparing nursing students to care for this aging population. However, studies reveal negative attitudes among nursing students toward older adults. A three-phased educational intervention that included an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven virtual simulation was implemented to address this. AI-generated simulations promise to expose marginalized groups and strengthen future nurses' knowledge, skills, and attitudes.\nA convergent mixed-method design was used to measure the change in nursing students' attitudes toward older adults, as measured by the UCLA Geriatrics Attitudes Survey and a Guided Reflection survey after participating in an Artificial Intelligence in Education learning event (\nThe results indicate that post-intervention scores (M = 35.07, SD = 5.34) increased from pre-intervention scores (M = 34.50, SD = 4.86). This difference was statistically significant at the 0.10 significance level (t = 1.88, \nUtilizing artificial intelligence technology during educational events effectively yields measurable learning outcomes. Cultivating positive attitudes toward older adults is essential for competent care in an aging society. This study was prospectively approved by the university's Institutional Review Board (IRB) on 30 July 2021, IRB-FY22-3.",

    "abstract": "Covalent modification of proteins at specific, predetermined sites is essential for advancing biological and biopharmaceutical applications. Site-selective labeling techniques for protein modification allow us to effectively track biological function, intracellular dynamics, and localization. Despite numerous reports on modifying target proteins with functional chemical probes, unique organic reactions that achieve site-selective integration without compromising native functional properties remain a significant challenge. In this review, we delve into site-selective protein modification using synthetic probes, highlighting both chemical and computational methodologies for chemo- and regioselective modifications of naturally occurring amino acids, as well as proximity-driven protein-selective chemical modifications. We also underline recent traceless affinity labeling strategies that involve exchange/cleavage reactions and catalyst tethering modifications. The rapid development of computational infrastructure and methods has made the bioconjugation of proteins more accessible, enabling precise predictions of structural changes due to protein modifications. Hence, we discuss bioconjugational computational approaches, including molecular dynamics and artificial intelligence, underscoring their potential applications in enhancing our understanding of cellular biology and addressing current challenges in the field.",

    "abstract": "The current study examined the relationship between creative potential, estimated with tests of divergent thinking (DT), and emotional intelligence (EI). Previous research has hinted at a relationship, but the EI-DT relationship may differ as a function of the tasks and the specific components of EI. With this in mind, the present investigation compared two DT tests (Social Games vs. Titles Games) and examined whether or not the Interpersonal and Intrapersonal subscales of EI were more associated with DT than the Adaptability and Stress Management EI subscales. The youth version of the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i: YV) was used to measure EI. The measure of EI and the two DT tests were administered to 244 male and female gifted (",

    "abstract": "This study aims to assess Croatian dentists' knowledge, attitudes, and use of artificial intelligence (AI) and modern technology, while also identifying perceived barriers to AI and modern technology adoption and evaluating the need for further education and training.\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted in February 2024 among general dentists in Croatia using a self-structured questionnaire. A total of 200 respondents filled out the questionnaire. It included five sections: socio-demographic and professional information, self-assessment of AI and modern technology use, knowledge of AI in dentistry, current innovations and devices used in practice, and barriers to AI and modern technology integration in practice. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and a regression analysis to explore relationships between socio-demographic factors and AI knowledge.\nThe mean knowledge of AI systems was 3.62 \u00b1 2.56 out of a possible score of 7, indicating relatively poor knowledge, with 47.5% demonstrating knowledge below the median. Most respondents (76.0%) did not use AI systems and modern technology in practice; however, prosthodontics (13.0%) and oral surgery (10.0%) were identified as the primary fields utilizing these technologies. Respondents rated their knowledge of modern technologies and AI as weak or moderate, with 60.5% engaged in continuous education. Despite 76.0% not using AI daily, 71.0% believed that these technologies could enhance patient care. Participants interested in further training showed significantly better knowledge of AI applications (\nThe study revealed that most respondents had poor knowledge of AI systems. Despite this, there is a recognition of AI's and modern technology potential in dentistry, emphasizing the need for enhanced education and training in this field.",

    "abstract": "We previously developed artificial intelligence (AI) diagnosis algorithms for predicting the six classes of stomach lesions. However, this required significant computational resources. The incorporation of AI into medical devices has evolved from centralized models to decentralized edge computing devices. In this study, a deep learning endoscopic image classification model was created to automatically categorize all phases of gastric carcinogenesis using an edge computing device.\nA total of 15,910 endoscopic images were collected retrospectively and randomly assigned to train, validation, and internal-test datasets in an 8:1:1 ratio. The major outcomes were as follows: 1. lesion classification accuracy in six categories: normal/atrophy/intestinal metaplasia/dysplasia/early/advanced gastric cancer; and 2. the prospective evaluation of classification accuracy in real-world procedures.\nThe internal-test lesion-classification accuracy was 93.8% (95% confidence interval: 93.4-94.2%); precision was 88.6%, recall was 88.3%, and F1 score was 88.4%. For the prospective performance test, the established model attained an accuracy of 93.3% (91.5-95.1%). The established model's lesion classification inference speed was 2-3 ms on GPU and 5-6 ms on CPU. The expert endoscopists reported no delays in lesion classification or any interference from the deep learning model throughout their exams.\nWe established a deep learning endoscopic image classification model to automatically classify all stages of gastric carcinogenesis using an edge computing device.",

    "abstract": "This qualitative literature review explored the intersection of art, creativity, and the nurse-patient relationship in the context of oncology nursing. It delved into the perceptions and reflections of nurses as captured by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) analysis from two specialized nursing databases.\nThe protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) Platform. A comprehensive search was conducted in CINAHL, the British Nursing Database, and the Nursing & Allied Health Database, using keywords related to art, cancer, creativity, nursing, and relationships. The extracted qualitative research studies were then analyzed using GAI to identify key themes and insights.\nThe analysis revealed profound considerations regarding the role of nurses in oncology and palliative patient care. Nurses acknowledged the spiritual dimension through religious and spiritual practices, while emphasizing authentic presence and empathic communication. They actively addressed patient concerns, adapted to challenges, and engaged in continuous professional development. The insights from the GAI interpretation underscored the significance of empathy, creativity, and artistry in nurturing meaningful nurse-patient connections.\nThe GAI-enabled exploration provided valuable insights into several dimensions of care, emphasizing the importance of spiritual sensitivity, empathic communication, and ongoing professional growth. As technology and human care converge, integrating artistry into the nurse-patient relationship could enhance patient experiences, improve outcomes, and enrich the oncology nursing practice.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety and depression represent prevalent yet frequently undetected mental health concerns within the older population. The challenge of identifying these conditions presents an opportunity for artificial intelligence (AI)-driven, remotely available, tools capable of screening and monitoring mental health. A critical criterion for such tools is their cultural adaptability to ensure effectiveness across diverse populations.\nThis study aims to illustrate the preliminary transferability of two established AI models designed to detect high depression and anxiety symptom scores. The models were initially trained on data from a nonverbal working memory game (1- and 2-back tasks) in a dataset by thymia, a company that develops AI solutions for mental health and well-being assessments, encompassing over 6000 participants from the United Kingdom, United States, Mexico, Spain, and Indonesia. We seek to validate the models' performance by applying it to a new dataset comprising older Brazilian adults, thereby exploring its transferability and generalizability across different demographics and cultures.\nA total of 69 Brazilian participants aged 51-92 years old were recruited with the help of La\u00e7os Sa\u00fade, a company specializing in nurse-led, holistic home care. Participants received a link to the thymia dashboard every Monday and Thursday for 6 months. The dashboard had a set of activities assigned to them that would take 10-15 minutes to complete, which included a 5-minute game with two levels of the n-back tasks. Two Random Forest models trained on thymia data to classify depression and anxiety based on thresholds defined by scores of the Patient Health Questionnaire (8 items) (PHQ-8) \u226510 and those of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (7 items) (GAD-7) \u226510, respectively, were subsequently tested on the La\u00e7os Sa\u00fade patient cohort.\nThe depression classification model exhibited robust performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78, a specificity of 0.69, and a sensitivity of 0.72. The anxiety classification model showed an initial AUC of 0.63, with a specificity of 0.58 and a sensitivity of 0.64. This performance surpassed a benchmark model using only age and gender, which had AUCs of 0.47 for PHQ-8 and 0.53 for GAD-7. After recomputing the AUC scores on a cross-sectional subset of the data (the first n-back game session), we found AUCs of 0.79 for PHQ-8 and 0.76 for GAD-7.\nThis study successfully demonstrates the preliminary transferability of two AI models trained on a nonverbal working memory task, one for depression and the other for anxiety classification, to a novel sample of older Brazilian adults. Future research could seek to replicate these findings in larger samples and other cultural contexts.",

    "abstract": "The construction industry is rapidly adopting Industry 4.0 technologies, creating new opportunities to address persistent environmental and operational challenges. This review focuses on how Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) are being leveraged to tackle these issues. It specifically explores AI's role in predicting air pollution, improving material quality, monitoring worker health and safety, and enhancing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for construction. This study evaluates various AI and ML models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines SVMs, as well as optimization techniques like whale and moth flame optimization. These tools are assessed for their ability to predict air pollutant levels, improve concrete quality, and monitor worker safety in real time. Research papers were also reviewed to understand AI's application in predicting the compressive strength of materials like cement mortar, fly ash, and stabilized clay soil. The performance of these models is measured using metrics such as coefficient of determination (",

    "abstract": "Collaborative intelligence (CI) involves human-machine interactions and is deemed safety-critical because their reliable interactions are crucial in preventing severe injuries and environmental damage. As these applications become increasingly data-driven, the reliability of CI applications depends on the quality of data, shaping the system's ability to interpret and respond in diverse and often unpredictable environments. In this regard, it is important to adhere to data quality standards and guidelines, thus facilitating the advancement of these collaborative systems in industry. This study presents the challenges of data quality in CI applications within industrial environments, with two use cases that focus on the collection of data in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). The first use case involves a framework for quantifying human and robot performance within the context of naturalistic robot learning, wherein humans teach robots using intuitive programming methods within the domain of HRI. The second use case presents real-time user state monitoring for adaptive multi-modal teleoperation, that allows for a dynamic adaptation of the system's interface, interaction modality and automation level based on user needs. The article proposes a hybrid standardization derived from established data quality-related ISO standards and addresses the unique challenges associated with multi-modal HRI data acquisition. The use cases presented in this study were carried out as part of an EU-funded project, Collaborative Intelligence for Safety-Critical Systems (CISC).",

    "abstract": "Community-based learning approaches are gaining recognition in nursing education as a means to address the needs of aging societies by fostering empathy, emotional intelligence, and caring behaviors among nursing students. These attributes are essential for enhancing the quality of care and building strong interpersonal connections with older adults. While community-based education programs offer promising benefits, there is still limited understanding of their impact on nursing students' empathy, emotional intelligence, and caring behaviors. This scoping review aims to examine how community-based educational interventions can assist nursing students in developing these essential competencies, ultimately contributing to better outcomes in geriatric care.\nA scoping review was conducted following the framework of Arksey and O'Malley.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have become critical components in the transformation of healthcare. They offer enhanced diagnostic accuracy, personalized treatment plans, and support for clinical decision-making. However, with these advancements come significant ethical challenges, including concerns around transparency, bias, data privacy, and the potential displacement of healthcare professionals. This review delves into these ethical concerns, issues of transparency, data privacy, bias, and the moral responsibility of decision-making with a particular focus on the role of AI in new drug/genetic treatment discovery, exploring how AI models are employed in protein, RNA, and DNA structural prediction to accelerate drug development.\u00a0Addressing these challenges is crucial for ensuring that AI is used responsibly, benefiting patients while maintaining trust in the healthcare system.",

    "abstract": "Bamboo culm has been widely used in engineering for its high strength, lightweight, and low cost. Its outermost epidermis is a smooth and dense layer that contains cellulose, silica particles, and stomata and acts as a water and mechanical barrier. Recent experimental studies have shown that the layer has a higher mechanical strength than other inside regions. Still, the mechanism is unclear, especially for how the low silica concentration (<10%) can effectively reinforce the layer and prevent the inner fibers from splitting. Here, theoretical analysis is combined with experimental imaging and 3D printing to investigate the effect of the distribution of silica particles on composite mechanics. The anisotropic partial distribution function of silica particles in bamboo skin yields higher toughness (>10%) than randomly distributed particles. A generative artificial intelligence (AI) model inspired by bamboo epidermis is developed to generate particle-reinforced composites. Besides the visual similarity, it is found that the samples by the generative model show failure processes and fracture toughness identical to the actual bamboo epidermis. This work reveals the micromechanics of the bamboo epidermis. It illustrates that generative AI can help design bio-inspired composites of a complex structure that cannot be uniformly represented by a simple building block or optimized around local boundaries. It expands the design space of particle-reinforced composites for enhanced toughness modulus, offering advantages in industries where mechanical reliability is critical.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted medical imaging, particularly in gastrointestinal endoscopy. Computer-aided detection and diagnosis systems (CADe and CADx) are thought to enhance the quality of colonoscopy procedures.\nColonoscopy is essential for colorectal cancer screening, but often misses a significant percentage of adenomas. AI-assisted systems employing deep learning offer improved detection and differentiation of colorectal polyps, potentially increasing adenoma detection rates by 8%-10%. The main benefit of CADe is in detecting small adenomas, whereas it has a limited impact on advanced neoplasm detection. Recent advancements include real-time CADe systems and CADx for histopathological predictions, aiding in the differentiation of neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Biases such as the Hawthorne effect and potential overdiagnosis necessitate large-scale clinical trials to validate the long-term benefits of AI. Additionally, novel concepts such as computer-aided quality improvement systems are emerging to address limitations facing current CADe systems.\nDespite the potential of AI for enhancing colonoscopy outcomes, its effectiveness in reducing colorectal cancer incidence and mortality remains unproven. Further prospective studies are essential to establish the overall utility and clinical benefits of AI in colonoscopy.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), defined as algorithms built to reproduce human behavior, has various applications in health care such as risk prediction, medical image classification, text analysis, and complex disease diagnosis. Due to the increasing availability and volume of data, especially from electronic health records, AI technology is expanding into all fields of nursing and medicine. As the health care system moves toward automation and computationally driven clinical decision-making, nurses play a vital role in bridging the gap between the technological output, the patient, and the health care team. We explore the nurses' role in translating AI-generated output to patients and identify considerations for ensuring informed consent and shared decision-making throughout the process. A brief review of AI technology and informed consent, an identification of power dynamics that underly informed consent, and descriptions of the role of the nurse in various relationships such as nurse-AI, nurse-patient, and patient-AI are covered. Ultimately, nurses and physicians bear the responsibility of upholding and safeguarding the right to informed choice, as it is a fundamental aspect of safe and ethical patient-centered health care.",

    "abstract": "How can we best achieve tissue segmentation and cell counting of multichannel-stained endometriosis sections to understand tissue composition?\nA combination of a machine learning-based tissue analysis software for tissue segmentation and a deep learning-based algorithm for segmentation-independent cell identification shows strong performance on the automated histological analysis of endometriosis sections.\nEndometriosis is characterized by the complex interplay of various cell types and exhibits great variation between patients and endometriosis subtypes.\nEndometriosis tissue samples of eight patients of different subtypes were obtained during surgery.\nEndometriosis tissue was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded before sectioning and staining by (multiplex) immunohistochemistry. A 6-plex immunofluorescence panel in combination with a nuclear stain was established following a standardized protocol. This panel enabled the distinction of different tissue structures and dividing cells. Artificial intelligence-based tissue and cell phenotyping were employed to automatically segment the various tissue structures and extract quantitative features.\nAn endometriosis-specific multiplex panel comprised of PanCK, CD10, \u03b1-SMA, calretinin, CD45, Ki67, and DAPI enabled the distinction of tissue structures in endometriosis. Whereas a machine learning approach enabled a reliable segmentation of tissue substructure, for cell identification, the segmentation-free deep learning-based algorithm was superior.\nThe present analysis was conducted on a limited number of samples for method establishment. For further refinement, quantification of collagen-rich cell-free areas should be included which could further enhance the assessment of the extent of fibrotic changes. Moreover, the method should be applied to a larger number of samples to delineate subtype-specific differences.\nWe demonstrate the great potential of combining multiplex staining and cell phenotyping for endometriosis research. The optimization procedure of the multiplex panel was transferred from a cancer-related project, demonstrating the robustness of the procedure beyond the cancer context. This panel can be employed for larger batch analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the deep learning-based approach is capable of performing cell phenotyping on tissue types that were not part of the training set underlining the potential of the method for heterogenous endometriosis samples.\nAll funding was provided through departmental funds.

    "abstract": "In laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery, proper recognition of loose connective tissue, nerves, vas deferens, and microvessels is important to prevent postoperative complications, such as recurrence, pain, sexual dysfunction, and bleeding. EUREKA (Anaut Inc., Tokyo, Japan) is a system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) for anatomical recognition. This system can intraoperatively confirm the aforementioned anatomical landmarks. In this study, we validated the accuracy of EUREKA in recognizing dissection layers, nerves, vas deferens, and microvessels during transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TAPP).\nWe used TAPP videos to compare EUREKA's recognition of loose connective tissue, nerves, vas deferens, and microvessels with the original surgical video and examined whether EUREKA accurately identified these structures. Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1/Dice scores were calculated to quantitively evaluate AI predictive images.\nThe mean IoU and F1/Dice scores were 0.33 and 0.50 for connective tissue, 0.24 and 0.38 for nerves, 0.50 and 0.66 for the vas deferens, and 0.30 and 0.45 for microvessels, respectively. Compared with the images without EUREKA visualization, dissection layers were very clearly recognized and displayed when appropriate tension was applied.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) supports clinical and social competencies of a practicing dentist. The Bar-On EI model consists of inter-related competencies in five domains: Self-Perception, Self-Expression, Interpersonal, Decision making, and Stress management. This study investigated the relationship between dental students' EI measured by Emotional Quotient Inventory 2.0 (EQ-i 2.0) and academic and clinical performance at three junctures: Initial, Mid, and Grad.\nThis retrospective cross-sectional study measured correlations between EQ-i 2.0 and performance measures such as Entering GPA and DAT scores, GPAs, preclinical (PreClinMean) and clinical grades (ClinMean), and program learning outcomes (PLOs). Ten cohorts completed three EQ assessments: Initial Attempt 1 (N\u00a0=\u00a0677), Mid Attempt 2 (N\u00a0=\u00a0515), and Grad Attempt 3 (N\u00a0=\u00a0472). Pearson correlations (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) were completed for Attempt 1\u00a0versus Entering GPA, DAT, Year 1 GPA; Attempt 2\u00a0vs. Year 2 GPA, PreclinMean; Attempt 3\u00a0versus Year 4 GPA, ClinMean, PLOs. Multivariate regression analysis was completed for Attempt 1 and Attempt 2\u00a0versus Performance measures. The attempts were compared with t test statistic (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05).\nAttempt 1 showed significant negative correlations between EI and pre-admissions measures. Attempt 1 and Attempt 2 showed significant positive associations for Self-Perception, Empathy, Impulse Control, and Stress Tolerance with academic performance and PLOs. Attempt 3 showed significant positive correlations for Social Responsibility, Empathy, Impulse Control and Decision making with clinical performance. The Interpersonal EQ domain, Empathy, and Happiness significantly declined during matriculation.\nEQ-i 2.0 total score correlated significantly with preclinical and clinical performance in this study and is important for dental student performance.",

    "abstract": "To propose a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based virtual assistant trained on tabular clinical data that can provide decision-making support in primary eye care practice and optometry education programmes.\nAnonymised clinical data from 1125 complete optometric examinations (2250 eyes; 63% women, 37% men) were used to train different machine learning algorithm models to predict eye examination classification (refractive, binocular vision dysfunction, ocular disorder or any combination of these three options). After modelling, adjustment, mining and preprocessing (one-hot encoding and SMOTE techniques), 75 input (preliminary data, history, oculomotor test and ocular examinations) and three output (refractive, binocular vision status and eye disease) features were defined. The data were split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets. Five machine learning algorithms were trained, and the best algorithms were subjected to fivefold cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated for accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1 score and specificity.\nThe random forest algorithm was the best for classifying eye examination results with a performance >95.2% (based on 35 input features from preliminary data and history), to propose a subclassification of ocular disorders with a performance >98.1% (based on 65 features from preliminary data, history and ocular examinations) and to differentiate binocular vision dysfunctions with a performance >99.7% (based on 30 features from preliminary data and oculomotor tests). These models were integrated into a responsive web application, available in three languages, allowing intuitive access to the AI models via conventional clinical terms.\nAn AI-based virtual assistant that performed well in predicting patient classification, eye disorders or binocular vision dysfunction has been developed with potential use in primary eye care practice and education programmes.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is administered to pediatric patients with cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. The traditional method uses focal echocardiography to complete the left ventricular measurement. However, echocardiographic determination of the ejection fraction (EF) by manual tracing of the endocardial borders is time consuming and operator dependent. The standard visual assessment is also an inherently subjective procedure. Artificial intelligence (AI) based machine learning-enabled image analysis might provide rapid, reproducible measurements of left ventricular volumes and EF for ECMO patients.\nThis study aims to evaluate the applicability of AI for monitoring cardiac function based on Echocardiography in patients with ECMO.\nWe conducted a retrospective study involving 29 hospitalized patients who received ECMO support between January 2017 and December 2021. Echocardiogram was performed for patients with ECMO, including at pre-ECMO, during cannulation, during ECMO support, during the ECMO wean, and a follow up within 3 months after weaning. EF assessment of all patients was independently evaluated by junior physicians (junior-EF) and experts (expert-EF) using Simpson's biplane method of manual tracing. Additionally, raw data images of apical 2-chamber and 4-chamber views were utilized for EF assessment via a Pediatric ECMO Quantification machine learning-enabled AI (automated-EF).\nThere was no statistically significant difference between the automated-EF and expert-EF for all groups (\nAutomated EF measurements are feasible for pediatric ECMO echocardiography. AI-automated analysis of echocardiography for quantifying left ventricular function in critically ill children has good consistency and reproducibility with that of clinical experts. The automated echocardiographic EF method is reliable for the quantitative evaluation of different heart rates. It can fully support the course of ECMO treatment, and it can help improve the accuracy of quantitative evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Emotional intelligence (EI), which encompasses the ability to perceive, understand, and manage emotions, is crucial for effective human interaction. In healthcare, especially in medicine, compassion and empathy are prioritized qualities associated with enhanced patient outcomes, increased patient compliance, and overall improved healthcare experiences. This study focused on postgraduate medical students to assess their EI levels and identify influencing factors. Methods This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the EI of postgraduate students at a medical college in Pune. Participants, who willingly participated, engaged in face-to-face interviews where they completed a questionnaire addressing sociodemographic information, workload, stress, and Schutte's Emotional Intelligence Test. Data analysis, conducted using MedCalc and Epi Info, presented qualitative variables as frequencies and quantitative data as mean (SD) or median (IQR). Statistical tests were used to identify the associations. Results Involving 139 postgraduates, our study found a mean EI score of 123.48 (12.30). The majority, 97(69.78%), displayed normal scores, 23 (16.55%) scored low, and 19 (13.67%) scored high. Males had higher EI scores. EI increased slightly from the first year to the final year. No significant associations were found with marital status or medical specialty; however, those facing recent emotional trauma exhibited higher levels. Conclusion EI exhibited no significant associations with age, marital status, residential status, year of study, duty hours, stress, or specialty. However, EI demonstrated significant association with male gender and those who faced emotional trauma.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic marked a before and after in the business world, causing a growing demand for applications that streamline operations, reduce delivery times and costs, and improve the quality of products. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) has taken a relevant role in improving these processes, since it incorporates mathematical models that allow analyzing the logical structure of the systems to detect and reduce errors or failures in real-time. This study aimed to determine the most relevant aspects to be considered for detecting software defects using AI. The methodology used was qualitative, with an exploratory, descriptive, and non-experimental approach. The technique involved a documentary review of 79 bibliometric references. The most relevant finding was the use of regression testing techniques and automated log files, in machine learning (ML) and robotic process automation (RPA) environments. These techniques help reduce the time required to identify failures, thereby enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in the lifecycle of applications. In conclusion, companies that incorporate AI algorithms will be able to include an agile model in their lifecycle, as they will reduce the rate of failures, errors, and breakdowns allowing cost savings, and ensuring quality.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common after stroke. Still, routine screening of OSA with polysomnography (PSG) is often unfeasible in clinical practice, primarily because of how limited resources are and the physical condition of patients. In this study, we used several artificial intelligence techniques to predict moderate-to-severe OSA and identify its features in patients with acute ischemic stroke.\nA total of 146 patients with acute ischemic stroke underwent PSG screening for OSA. Their baseline demographic characteristics, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score, and stroke risk factors, were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify significant features associated with moderate-to-severe OSA in patients with stroke. These significant features were used with six machine learning and ensemble learning algorithms, namely decision tree, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and gradient boosting, to compare the performance of several predictive models.\nMultivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age, sex, BMI, neck circumference, and ESS score were significantly associated with the presence of moderate-to-severe OSA. According to the machine learning and ensemble learning results, the XGBoost model achieved the highest performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 and an accuracy and F1 score of 0.80.\nThis study identified key factors contributing to moderate-to-severe OSA in patients with ischemic stroke. The XGBoost model exhibited high predictive performance, indicating it has potential as a supporting tool for decision-making in health-care settings.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the anxiety surrounding the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in doctor-patient interactions, analyzing the perspectives of both patients and healthcare providers to identify key concerns and potential solutions.\nThe study employs a comprehensive literature review, examining existing research on AI in healthcare, and synthesizes findings from various surveys and studies that explore the attitudes of patients and doctors towards AI applications in medical settings.\nThe analysis reveals that patient anxiety encompasses algorithm aversion, robophobia, lack of humanistic care, challenges in human-machine interaction, and concerns about AI's universal applicability. Doctors' anxieties stem from fears of replacement, legal liabilities, emotional impacts of work environment changes, and technological apprehension. The paper highlights the need for patient participation, humanistic care, improved interaction methods, educational training, and policy guidelines to foster public understanding and trust in AI.\nThe paper concludes that addressing AI anxiety in doctor-patient relationships is crucial for successfully integrating AI in healthcare. It emphasizes the importance of respecting patient autonomy, addressing the lack of humanistic care, and improving patient-AI interaction to enhance the patient experience and reduce medical errors.\nThe study suggests that future research should focus on understanding the needs and concerns of patients and doctors, strengthening medical humanities education, and establishing policies to guide the ethical use of AI in medicine. It also recommends public education to enhance understanding and trust in AI to improve medical services and ensure professional development and stable work environment for doctors.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing patient comprehension of their health is crucial in improving health outcomes. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in distilling medical information into a conversational, legible format can potentially enhance health literacy. This review aims to examine the accuracy, reliability, comprehensiveness and readability of medical patient education materials (PEMs) simplified by AI models. A systematic review was conducted searching for articles assessing outcomes of use of AI in simplifying PEMs. Inclusion criteria are as follows: publication between January 2019 and June 2023, various modalities of AI, English language, AI use in PEMs and including physicians and/or patients. An inductive thematic approach was utilised to code for unifying topics which were qualitatively analysed. Twenty studies were included, and seven themes were identified (reproducibility, accessibility and ease of use, emotional support and user satisfaction, readability, data security, accuracy and reliability and comprehensiveness). AI effectively simplified PEMs, with reproducibility rates up to 90.7% in specific domains. User satisfaction exceeded 85% in AI-generated materials. AI models showed promising readability improvements, with ChatGPT achieving 100% post-simplification readability scores. AI's performance in accuracy and reliability was mixed, with occasional lack of comprehensiveness and inaccuracies, particularly when addressing complex medical topics. AI models accurately simplified basic tasks but lacked soft skills and personalisation. These limitations can be addressed with higher-calibre models combined with prompt engineering. In conclusion, the literature reveals a scope for AI to enhance patient health literacy through medical PEMs. Further refinement is needed to improve AI's accuracy and reliability, especially when simplifying complex medical information.",

    "abstract": "Medical education, which generally relied heavily on intelligence quotients, has found a new value in emotional intelligence (EI), specifically after the challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had some apparent and some intangible effects, as this required an emergency switch to online teaching and learning.\u00a0 Aim: This study was conducted to compare the trait emotional intelligence (TEI) score of medical undergraduates with the increasing number of years of medical curriculum. The COVID-19 pandemic serendipitously provided an opportunity to compare the TEI scores in pre-pandemic and during pandemic times.\u00a0 Materials and methods: Trait emotional intelligence was computed using a pre-validated Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form (TEIQue-SF). The study was conducted in two time frames and in two study groups, the Class of 2019 (pre-pandemic cohort) and the Class of 2020 (pandemic cohort). Further, the pre-pandemic cohort's EI score was assessed twice, initially in August 2019 (Timeframe 1 (T1) which was before the pandemic) and secondly in October 2020 (Timeframe 2 (T2) which was\u00a0during the pandemic) in Phase II and the COVID-19 first wave was peaking in India. The TEI scores of the pre-pandemic cohort and pandemic cohort were compared using an unpaired T-test. The pre-pandemic cohort scores assessed in two time frames were compared using a paired T-test.\u00a0 Results: The pandemic cohort showed significantly less total TEI (p < 0.05) and well-being score (p < 0.05) in the pre-pandemic cohort from August 2019 (T1) to October 2020 (T2) (p = 0.036).\u00a0 Conclusions: The low TEI scores in the pandemic cohort may be attributed to the sudden psychological and social effects of the pandemic. Moreover, with advancing age and years of medical curriculum, the TEI scores increased.",

    "abstract": "The magnetic resonance images (MRIs) ability of lesion detection in epilepsy is crucial for a diagnosis and surgical outcome. Using automated artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools for measuring cortical thickness and brain volume originally developed for dementia, we aimed to identify whether it could lateralize epilepsy with normal MRIs.\nNon-lesional 3-Tesla MRIs of 428 patients diagnosed with focal epilepsy, based on semiology and electroencephalography findings, were analyzed. AI-based segmentation/volumetry software measured the cortical thickness and the hippocampal volume. The laterality index (LI) was calculated.\nWe classified into temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE, n=294), frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE, n=86), occipital lobe epilepsy (OLE, n=29), and parietal lobe epilepsy (PLE, n=22). Onset age and MRI age were 24.0\u00b116.6 (0-84) and 35.6\u00b114.8 (16-84) years old. In FLE, the LI of frontal thickness was significantly different between the left and right FLE groups, with LIs of the right FLE group being right-shifted and those of the left FLE group being left-shifted, indicating that the lesion side was thinner than the non-lesion side (\nAI-based brain segmentation software can be helpful to decide the laterality of non-lesional FLE especially with longer duration of disease.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative infections significantly impact patient outcomes and costs, exacerbated by late diagnoses, yet early reliable predictors are scarce. Existing artificial intelligence (AI) models for postoperative infection prediction often lack external validation or perform poorly in local settings when validated. We aimed to develop locally valid models as part of the PERISCOPE AI system to enable early detection, safer discharge, and more timely treatment of patients.\nWe developed and validated XGBoost models to predict postoperative infections within 7 and 30 days of surgery. Using retrospective pre-operative and intra-operative electronic health record data from 2014 to 2023 across various surgical specialities, the models were developed at Hospital A and validated and updated at Hospitals B and C in the Netherlands and Belgium. Model performance was evaluated before and after updating using the two most recent years of data as temporal validation datasets. Main outcome measures were model discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)), calibration (slope, intercept, and plots), and clinical utility (decision curve analysis with net benefit).\nThe study included 253,010 surgical procedures with 23,903 infections within 30-days. Discriminative performance, calibration properties, and clinical utility significantly improved after updating. Final AUROCs after updating for Hospitals A, B, and C were 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-0.83), 0.82 (95% CI 0.81-0.83), and 0.91 (95% CI 0.90-0.91) respectively for 30-day predictions on the temporal validation datasets (2022-2023). Calibration plots demonstrated adequate correspondence between observed outcomes and predicted risk. All local models were deemed clinically useful as the net benefit was higher than default strategies (treat all and treat none) over a wide range of clinically relevant decision thresholds.\nPERISCOPE can accurately predict overall postoperative infections within 7- and 30-days post-surgery. The robust performance implies potential for improving clinical care in diverse clinical target populations. This study supports the need for approaches to local updating of AI models to account for domain shifts in patient populations and data distributions across different clinical settings.\nThis study was funded by a REACT EU grant from European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Kansen voor West.",

    "abstract": "Suicide remains a leading cause of death globally, with nearly 800,000 deaths annually, particularly among young adults in regions like Europe, Australia, and the Middle East, highlighting the urgent need for innovative intervention strategies beyond conventional methods.\nThis review aims to explore the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in enhancing suicide risk prediction and developing effective prevention strategies, examining how these technologies integrate complex risk factors, including psychiatric, socio-economic, dietary, and environmental influences.\nA comprehensive review of literature from databases such as PubMed and Web of Science was conducted, focusing on studies that utilize AI and ML technologies. The review assessed the efficacy of various models, including Random Forest, neural networks, and others, in analyzing data from electronic health records, social media, and digital behaviors. Additionally, it evaluated a broad spectrum of dietary factors and their influence on suicidal behaviors, as well as the impact of environmental contaminants like lithium, arsenic, fluoride, mercury, and organophosphorus pesticides.\nAI and ML are revolutionizing suicide prevention strategies, with models achieving nearly 90\u00a0% predictive accuracy by integrating diverse data sources. Our findings highlight the need for geographically and demographically tailored public health interventions and comprehensive AI models that address the multifactorial nature of suicide risk. However, the deployment of these technologies must address critical ethical and privacy concerns, ensuring compliance with regulations and the development of transparent, ethically guided AI systems. AI-driven tools, such as virtual therapists and chatbots, are essential for immediate support, particularly in underserved regions.",

    "abstract": "We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model to detect immunotherapy -related adverse events (irAEs) from clinical narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) at the patient level.\nTraining data, used for internal validation of the AI model, comprised 1230 clinical notes from 30 patients at The Ohio State University James Cancer Hospital-20 patients who experienced irAEs and ten who did not. 3256 clinical notes of 50 patients were utilized for external validation of the AI model.\nUse of a leave-one-out cross-validation technique for internal validation among those 30 patients yielded accurate identification of 19 of 20 with irAEs (positive patients; 95% sensitivity) and correct dissociation of eight of ten without (negative patients; 80% specificity). External validation on 3256 clinical notes of 50 patients yielded high sensitivity (95%) but moderate specificity (64%). If we improve the model's specificity to 100%, it could eliminate the need to manually review 2500 of those 3256 clinical notes (77%).\nCombined use of this AI model with the manual review of clinical notes will improve both sensitivity and specificity in the detection of irAEs, decreasing workload and costs and facilitating the development of improved immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death caused by acute ocular hypertension is an important characteristic of acute glaucoma. Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) that mediates necroptosis is a potential therapeutic target for RGC death. However, the current understanding of the targeting agents and mechanisms of RIPK3 in the treatment of glaucoma remains limited. Notably, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have significantly advanced drug discovery. This study aimed to discover RIPK3 inhibitor with AI assistance.\nAn acute ocular hypertension model was used to simulate pathological ocular hypertension in vivo. We employed a series of AI methods, including large language and graph neural network models, to identify the target compounds of RIPK3. Subsequently, these target candidates were validated using molecular simulations (molecular docking, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) prediction, and molecular dynamics simulations) and biological experiments (Western blotting and fluorescence staining) in vitro and in vivo.\nAI-driven drug screening techniques have the potential to greatly accelerate drug development. A compound called HG9-91-01, identified using AI methods, exerted neuroprotective effects in acute glaucoma. Our research indicates that all five candidates recommended by AI were able to protect the morphological integrity of RGC cells when exposed to hypoxia and glucose deficiency, and HG9-91-01\u00a0showed a higher cell survival rate compared to the other candidates. Furthermore, HG9-91-01 was found to protect the retinal structure and reduce the loss of retinal layers in an acute glaucoma model. It was also observed that the neuroprotective effects of HG9-91-01 were highly correlated with the inhibition of PANoptosis (apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis). Finally, we found that HG9-91-01 can regulate key proteins related to PANoptosis, indicating that this compound exerts neuroprotective effects in the retina by inhibiting the expression of proteins related to apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis.\nAI-enabled drug discovery revealed that HG9-91-01 could serve as a potential treatment for acute glaucoma.",

A compound called HG9-91-01, identified using AI methods, exerted neuroprotective effects in acute glaucoma. Our research indicates that all five candidates recommended by AI were able to protect the morphological integrity of RGC cells when exposed to hypoxia and glucose deficiency, and HG9-91-01\u00a0showed a higher cell survival rate compared to the other candidates. Furthermore, HG9-91-01 was found to protect the retinal structure and reduce the loss of retinal layers in an acute glaucoma model. It was also observed that the neuroprotective effects of HG9-91-01 were highly correlated with the inhibition of PANoptosis (apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis). Finally, we found that HG9-91-01 can regulate key proteins related to PANoptosis, indicating that this compound exerts neuroprotective effects in the retina by inhibiting the expression of proteins related to apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis.",

    "abstract": "The composite physiologic index (CPI) was developed to estimate the extent of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients based on pulmonary function tests (PFTs). The CALIPER-revised version of the CPI (CALIPER-CPI) was also developed to estimate the volume fraction of ILD measured by CALIPER, an automated quantitative CT postprocessing software. Recently, artificial intelligence-based quantitative CT image analysis software (AIQCT), which can be used to quantify the bronchial volume separately from the ILD volume, was developed and validated in IPF. The aim of this study was to develop AIQCT-derived CPI formulas to quantify CT abnormalities in IPF and to investigate the associations of these CPI formulas with survival.\nThe first cohort included 116 patients with IPF. In this cohort, ILD, bronchial, and hyperlucent volumes on CT were quantified using AIQCT. New CPI formulas were developed based on PFTs to estimate the volume fraction of ILD (ILD-CPI), the sum of the ILD and bronchial volume fractions (ILDB-CPI), and the sum of the ILD, bronchial and hyperlucent volume fractions (ILDBH-CPI). The associations of the original CPI, the CALIPER-CPI and the AIQCT-derived CPIs with survival were analyzed in the first cohort and in a second cohort of patients with IPF (n\u2009=\u200972).\nIn the first cohort, over a median observation time of 92.8 months, 79 patients (68.1%) died, and one patient (0.9%) underwent living-donor lung transplantation. The original CPI, the CALIPER-CPI, and all AIQCT-derived CPIs were associated with overall survival (hazard ratios: 1.07-1.22). The C-index of the ILDB-CPI (0.759) was the highest among all AIQCT-derived CPIs and was comparable to that of the original CPI (0.765) and the CALIPER-CPI (0.749). The C-index of the ILDBH-CPI (0.729) was lower than that of the other CPI variables. The second cohort yielded similar C-indices as the first cohort for the original CPI (0.738), CALIPER-CPI (0.757) and ILDB-CPI (0.749).\nThe ILDB-CPI can predict the outcomes of IPF patients with a similar performance to that of the original CPI and the CALIPER-CPI. Adding the hyperlucent volume to the CPI formula did not improve its predictive accuracy for mortality.\nNone (no health care interventions were performed).",

    "abstract": "Interactive artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT have gained popularity, yet little is known about their reliability as a reference tool for healthcare-related information for healthcare providers and trainees. The objective of this study was to assess the consistency, quality, and accuracy of the responses generated by ChatGPT on healthcare-related inquiries.\nA total of 18 open-ended questions including six questions in three defined clinical areas (2 each to address \"what\", \"why\", and \"how\", respectively) were submitted to ChatGPT v3.5 based on real-world usage experience. The experiment was conducted in duplicate using 2 computers. Five investigators independently ranked each response using a 4-point scale to rate the quality of the bot's responses. The Delphi method was used to compare each investigator's score with the goal of reaching at least 80% consistency. The accuracy of the responses was checked using established professional references and resources. When the responses were in question, the bot was asked to provide reference material used for the investigators to determine the accuracy and quality. The investigators determined the consistency, accuracy, and quality by establishing a consensus.\nThe speech pattern and length of the responses were consistent within the same user but different between users. Occasionally, ChatGPT provided 2 completely different responses to the same question. Overall, ChatGPT provided more accurate responses (8 out of 12) to the \"what\" questions with less reliable performance to the \"why\" and \"how\" questions. We identified errors in calculation, unit of measurement, and misuse of protocols by ChatGPT. Some of these errors could result in clinical decisions leading to harm. We also identified citations and references shown by ChatGPT that did not exist in the literature.\nChatGPT is not ready to take on the coaching role for either healthcare learners or healthcare professionals. The lack of consistency in the responses to the same question is problematic for both learners and decision-makers. The intrinsic assumptions made by the chatbot could lead to erroneous clinical decisions. The unreliability in providing valid references is a serious flaw in using ChatGPT to drive clinical decision making.",

Overall, ChatGPT provided more accurate responses (8 out of 12) to the \"what\" questions with less reliable performance to the \"why\" and \"how\" questions. We identified errors in calculation, unit of measurement, and misuse of protocols by ChatGPT. Some of these errors could result in clinical decisions leading to harm. We also identified citations and references shown by ChatGPT that did not exist in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrates high potential when applied to radiomic analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to discriminate sinonasal tumors. This can enhance diagnostic suspicion beyond visual assessment alone and prior to biopsy, leading to expedite the diagnostic timeline and the treatment planning. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the current advancements and accuracy of this technology in this domain.\nA systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria comprised studies utilizing any machine learning approach applied to MRI of patients with sinonasal tumors. For each study, comprehensive data were gathered on the MRI protocols, feature extraction techniques, and classifiers employed to develop the AI model. The performance was assessed based on accuracy and area under the curve (AUC).\nFourteen studies, published between May 2017 and August 2024, were included. These studies were categorized into three groups: those examining both benign and malignant tumors, those investigating malignant tumor subpopulations, and those focusing on benign pathologies. All studies reported an AUC greater than 0.800, achieving AUC\u2009>\u20090.89 and accuracy\u2009>\u20090.81 when incorporating clinical-radiological variables. Notably, the best discrimination performance was observed in studies utilizing combined conventional MRI sequences, including T1-weighted, contrasted T1-weighted, and T2-weighted images.\nThe application of AI and radiomics in analyzing MRI scans presents significant promise for improving the discrimination of sinonasal tumors. Integrating clinical and radiological indicators enhances model performance, suggesting that future research should focus on larger patient cohorts and diverse AI methodologies to refine diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the nutritional status, height development and intellectual development level of rural children aged 10-12 years in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, and to analyze the relationship between the nutritional status and height development of local schoolchildren and their intellectual development.\nIn 2019, a total of 1721 students were selected from 8 counties(cities) under the jurisdiction of Linxia Prefecture in Gansu Province, with 1 township selected from each county in 5 directions: east, west, south, north, and central. One primary school was randomly selected from each township, and 45 students aged 10-12 were selected from each primary school. Measure children&apos;s height and weight data, calculate body mass index(BMI). Using the Chinese Joint Raven Test(Rural Edition) for intelligence testing and using the norm to calculate their intelligence quotient(IQ). Based on national standards for children&apos;s nutrition, height development, and intelligence, explore the relationship between children&apos;s nutritional status, height development, and intelligence.\nThe IQ of children with moderate to severe weight loss, mild weight loss, normal, overweight, and obesity were 102.7, 102.8, 103.3, 102.5 and 106.9, respectively. The better the nutritional status of children, the higher their IQ values, and the intelligence of children was statistically significant(H=602.816, P&lt;0.001). The detection rate of intellectual disability in overweight children was 0%, while the detection rate of low, marginal, and extremely excellent intelligence in obese children was 0%. The IQ of children in the growth retardation group and non growth retardation group were 99.5 and 103.3, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant(U=171.000, P&lt;0.05). The intelligence of children with different height development levels is statistically significant(H=55.174, P&lt;0.001), and the average intelligence of children increases with the increase of height levels. The detection rate of low and marginal intelligence among children with upper height was 0%, the detection rate of extremely high intelligence was also 0%, and the detection rate of average and above intelligence was 90.9%. Ordered logistic regression analysis showed that the height level was above average(OR=0.598, 95%CI 0.397-0.899, P&lt;0.05), above average(OR=0.002, 95%CI 0.027 2-0.747, P&lt;0.05), nutritional status was normal(OR=0.633, 95%CI 0.484-0.980, P&lt;0.05), overweight(OR=0.487, 95%CI 0.299-0.795, P&lt;0.05), obesity(OR=0.569, 95%CI 0.358-0.907, P&lt;0.05), and non growth and developmental delay(OR=0.578, 95%CI 0.371-0.901, P&lt;0.05) were all local. Protective factors for the intelligence of children.\nThe nutritional status and height development of rural children in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province are related to intelligence.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, has added complexity and richness to the virtual environment by increasing the presence of AI-generated content (AIGC). Although social media platforms such as TikTok have begun labeling AIGC to facilitate the ability for users to distinguish it from human-generated content, little research has been performed to examine the effect of these AIGC labels.\nThis study investigated the impact of AIGC labels on perceived accuracy, message credibility, and sharing intention for misinformation through a web-based experimental design, aiming to refine the strategic application of AIGC labels.\nThe study conducted a 2\u00d72\u00d72 mixed experimental design, using the AIGC labels (presence vs absence) as the between-subjects factor and information type (accurate vs inaccurate) and content category (for-profit vs not-for-profit) as within-subjects factors. Participants, recruited via the Credamo platform, were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (with labels) or a control group (without labels). Each participant evaluated 4 sets of content, providing feedback on perceived accuracy, message credibility, and sharing intention for misinformation. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 29 and included repeated-measures ANOVA and simple effects analysis, with significance set at P<.05.\nAs of April 2024, this study recruited a total of 957 participants, and after screening, 400 participants each were allocated to the experimental and control groups. The main effects of AIGC labels were not significant for perceived accuracy, message credibility, or sharing intention. However, the main effects of information type were significant for all 3 dependent variables (P<.001), as were the effects of content category (P<.001). There were significant differences in interaction effects among the 3 variables. For perceived accuracy, the interaction between information type and content category was significant (P=.005). For message credibility, the interaction between information type and content category was significant (P<.001). Regarding sharing intention, both the interaction between information type and content category (P<.001) and the interaction between information type and AIGC labels (P=.008) were significant.\nThis study found that AIGC labels minimally affect perceived accuracy, message credibility, or sharing intention but help distinguish AIGC from human-generated content. The labels do not negatively impact users' perceptions of platform content, indicating their potential for fact-checking and governance. However, AIGC labeling applications should vary by information type; they can slightly enhance sharing intention and perceived accuracy for misinformation. This highlights the need for more nuanced strategies for AIGC labels, necessitating further research.",

    "abstract": "The EZ DEVICE is an integrated fluorescence microflow cytometer designed for automated cell phenotyping and enumeration using artificial intelligence (AI). The platform consists of a laser diode, optical filter, objective lens, CMOS image sensor, and microfluidic chip, enabling automated sample pretreatment, labeling, and detection within a single compact unit. AI algorithms segment and identify objects in images captured by the CMOS sensor at 532 and 586\u00a0nm emission wavelengths. The device's counting performance, tested with rainbow and FITC-labeled beads, closely matched results from manual counting using an Olympus IX73 microscope. Antibody-staining efficiency was evaluated with antibody-particle beads and IgG k isotype-FITC, achieving a 99.06% staining efficiency. Practical feasibility was demonstrated through the phenotyping of immune cell lines (Jurkat T and THP-1) using specific fluorescent antibodies. The system successfully detected MHC I expression and distinguished CD3 expression patterns in Jurkat T-cells, demonstrating its capability to recognize distinct cell statuses. With its compact design, automated features, and efficient staining and detection, the EZ DEVICE shows promise for diverse applications, including clinical diagnostics, point-of-care testing, and research, enabling real-time immune monitoring and precise cell analysis. Future enhancements, such as optimized microfluidics, advanced imaging, and AI-driven algorithms, aim to improve single-cell throughput and expand its utility in personalized medicine and public health.",

    "abstract": "In 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT 3.5, which is now widely used in medical education, training, and research. Despite its valuable use for the generation of information, concerns persist about its authenticity and accuracy. Its undisclosed information source and outdated dataset pose risks of misinformation. Although it is widely used, AI-generated text inaccuracies raise doubts about its reliability. The ethical use of such technologies is crucial to uphold scientific accuracy in research.\nThis study aimed to assess the accuracy of ChatGPT in doing GESEA tests 1 and 2.\nThe 100 multiple-choice theoretical questions from GESEA certifications 1 and 2 were presented to ChatGPT, requesting the selection of the correct answer along with an explanation. Expert gynaecologists evaluated and graded the explanations for accuracy.\nChatGPT showed a 59% accuracy in responses, with 64% providing comprehensive explanations. It performed better in GESEA Level 1 (64% accuracy) than in GESEA Level 2 (54% accuracy) questions.\nChatGPT is a versatile tool in medicine and research, offering knowledge, information, and promoting evidence-based practice. Despite its widespread use, its accuracy has not been validated yet. This study found a 59% correct response rate, highlighting the need for accuracy validation and ethical use considerations. Future research should investigate ChatGPT's truthfulness in subspecialty fields such as gynaecologic oncology and compare different versions of chatbot for continuous improvement.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has a great potential in scientific research. However, the validity of outputs remains unverified. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of responses generated by ChatGPT to enhance the critical use of this tool.",

    "abstract": "The rise of Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping healthcare, particularly in medical imaging. In this emerging field, clinical imaging personnel need proper training. However, formal AI education is lacking in medical curricula, coupled with a shortage of studies synthesising the availability of AI curricula tailored for clinical imaging personnel. This study therefore addresses the question \"what are the current AI training programs or curricula for clinical imaging personnel?\"\nThis review follows Arksey & O'Malley's framework and the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. Six electronic databases were searched between June and September 2023 and the screening process comprised two stages. Data extraction was performed using a standardised charting form. Data was summarised in table format and thematically.\nTwenty-two studies were included in this review. The goals of the curriculum include enhancing AI knowledge through the delivery of educational content and encouraging practical application and skills development in AI. The learning objectives comprise technical proficiency and model development, foundational knowledge and understanding, literature review and information utilisation, and practical application and problem-solving skills. Course content spanned nine areas, from fundamentals of AI to imaging informatics. Most curricula adopted an online mode of delivery, and the program duration varied significantly. All programs utilised didactic presentations, with several incorporating additional teaching methods and activities to fulfil curriculum goals. The target audiences and participants primarily involved radiology residents, while the creators and instructors comprised a multidisciplinary team of radiology and AI personnel. Various tools and resources were utilised, encompassing online courses and cloud-based notebooks. The curricula were well-received by participants, and time constraint emerged as a major challenge.\nThis scoping review provides an overview of the AI educational programs from existing literature to guide future developments in AI educational curricula. Future education efforts should prioritise evidence-based curriculum design, expand training offerings to radiographers, increase content offerings in imaging informatics, and effectively utilise different teaching strategies and training tools and resources in the curriculum.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of 3 artificial intelligence language models-GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and Gemini, in delivering patient-centered information about thyroid eye disease (TED). We evaluated their performance based on the accuracy and comprehensiveness of their responses to common patient inquiries regarding TED. The study did not assess the repeatability of artificial intelligence responses, focusing on single-session evaluations per model.\nFive experienced oculoplastic surgeons assessed the responses generated by the artificial intelligence models to 12 key questions frequently asked by TED patients. These questions addressed TED pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and treatment options. Each response was rated for correctness and reliability on a 7-point Likert scale, where 1 indicated incorrect or unreliable information and 7 indicated highly accurate and reliable information. Correctness referred to factual accuracy, while reliability assessed trustworthiness for patient use. The evaluations were anonymized, and the final scores were averaged across the surgeons to facilitate model comparisons.\nGPT-3.5 emerged as the top performer, achieving an average correctness score of 5.75 and a reliability score of 5.68, excelling in delivering detailed information on complex topics such as TED treatment and surgical interventions. GPT-4o followed with scores of 5.32 for correctness and 5.25 for reliability, generally providing accurate but less detailed information. Gemini trailed with scores of 5.10 for correctness and 4.70 for reliability, often providing sufficient responses for simpler questions but lacking detail in complex areas like second-line immunosuppressive treatments. Statistical analysis using the Friedman test showed significant differences between models (p < 0.05) for key topics, with GPT-3.5 consistently leading.\nGPT-3.5 was the most effective model for delivering reliable and comprehensive patient information, particularly for complex treatment and surgical topics. GPT-4o provided reliable general information but lacked the necessary depth for specialized topics, while Gemini was suitable for addressing basic patient inquiries but insufficient for detailed medical information. This study highlights the role of artificial intelligence in patient education, suggesting that models like GPT-3.5 can be valuable tools for clinicians in enhancing patient understanding of TED.",

    "abstract": "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in anesthesiology has become increasingly widespread. However, no previous study has analyzed this field from the bibliometric analysis dimension. The objective of this paper was to assess the global research trends in AI in anesthesiology using bibliometric software. Literatures relevant to AI and anesthesiology were retrieved from the Web of Science until 10 April 2024 and were visualized and analyzed using Excel, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer. After screening, 491 studies were included in the final bibliometric analysis. The growth rate of publications, countries, institutions, authors, journals, literature co-citations, and keyword co-occurrences was computed. The number of publications increased annually since 2018, with the most significant contributions from the USA, China, and England. The top 3 institutions were Yuan Ze University, National Taiwan University, and Brunel University London. The top three journals were Anesthesia & Analgesia, BMC Anesthesiology, and the British Journal of Anaesthesia. The researches on the application of AI in predicting hypotension have been extensive and represented a hotspot and frontier. In terms of keyword co-occurrence cluster analysis, keywords were categorized into four clusters: ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia, postoperative pain and airway management, prediction, depth of anesthesia (DoA), and intraoperative drug infusion. This analysis provides a systematic analysis on the literature regarding the AI-related research in the field of anesthesiology, which may help researchers and anesthesiologists better understand the research trend of anesthesia-related AI.",

    "abstract": "Target 3.7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims for universal access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services by 2030, including family planning services, information, education, and integration into national strategies. In contemporary times, reproductive medicine is progressively incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance sperm cell prediction and selection, in vitro fertilisation models, infertility and pregnancy screening. AI is being integrated into five core components of Sexual Reproductive Health, including improving care, providing high-quality contraception and infertility services, eliminating unsafe abortions, as well as facilitating the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections. Though AI can improve sexual reproductive health and rights by addressing disparities and enhancing service delivery, AI-facilitated components have ethical implications, based on existing human rights and international conventions. Heated debates persist in implementing AI, particularly in maternal health, as well as sexual, reproductive health as the discussion centers on a torn between human touch and machine-driven care. In spite of this and other challenges, AI's application in sexual, and reproductive health and rights is crucial, particularly for developing countries, especially those that are yet to explore the application of AI in healthcare. Action plans are needed to roll out AI use in these areas effectively, and capacity building for health workers is essential to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals' Target 3.7. This commentary discusses innovations in sexual, and reproductive health and rights in meeting target 3.7 of the SDGs with a focus on artificial intelligence and highlights the need for a more circumspective approach in response to the ethical and human rights implications of using AI in providing sexual and reproductive health services.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of population aging, the incidence of orthopedic diseases increases annually. The early diagnosis and precise treatment of many orthopedic diseases still require advancements in technology to address effectively. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), this technology is expected to achieve early diagnosis and improved treatment of many diseases, providing revolutionary changes in clinical. However, the integration of AI in orthopedics is still in its infancy, and its existing intelligent algorithms have been clinically applied models and their advantages need to be further summarized to pave the way for future development and exploration. The review provides a concise overview of the basic concepts and mechanisms of AI in orthopedics, and summarizes orthopedic surgery and sports medicine in four areas of application and development, specifically, developing precision diagnostics, assisting treatment, monitoring assisted during rehabilitation, and enhancing educational research and data analysis. In this section, the main focus is on each aspect of the AI programs that are now used in clinical applications, and also comparing them to the purely manual results. In conclusion, the continued application and development of AI are anticipated to enhance our understanding of the diagnosis, progression, and prognosis of orthopedic diseases, ultimately laying the groundwork for more effective clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Breast artery calcification (BAC) obtained from standard mammographic images is currently under evaluation to stratify risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in women. Measuring BAC using artificial intelligence (AI) technology, we aimed to determine the relationship between BAC and coronary artery calcification (CAC) severity with Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE). This retrospective study included women who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) within one year of mammography. T-test assessed the associations between MACE and variables of interest (BAC versus MACE, CAC versus MACE). Risk differences were calculated to capture the difference in observed risk and reference groups. Chi-square tests and/or Fisher's exact tests were performed to assess age and ASCVD risk with MACE and to assess BAC and CAC association with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk as a secondary outcome. A logistic regression model was conducted to measure the odds ratio between explanatory variables (BAC and CAC) and the outcome variables (MACE). Out of the 99 patients included in the analysis, 49 patients (49.49%) were BAC positive, with 37 patients (37.37%) CAC positive, and 26 patients (26.26%) had MACE. One unit increase in BAC score resulted in a 6% increased odds of having a moderate to high ASCVD risk >7.5% (p = 0.01) and 2% increased odds of having MACE (p = 0.005). The odds of having a moderate-high ASCVD risk score in BAC positive patients was higher (OR = 4.27, 95% CI 1.58-11.56) than CAC positive (OR = 4.05, 95% CI 1.36-12.06) patients. In this study population, the presence of BAC is associated with MACE and useful in corroborating ASCVD risk. Our results provide evidence to support the potential utilization of AI generated BAC measurements from standard of care mammograms in addition to the widely adopted ASCVD and CAC scores, to identify and risk-stratify women who are at increased risk of CVD and may benefit from targeted prevention measures.",

    "abstract": "Aim: To analyze and compare the experiences and perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) among practicing doctors and medical students.\nMaterials and Methods: A survey was conducted among 30 doctors and 30 fifth-year master's students enrolled in the \"Medicine\" program. Participants were asked about their experiences with AI, their perceptions of AI's impact on their education and practice, and their views on the benefits and drawbacks of AI in the medical field. The data were analyzed to compare the responses between the two groups.\nResults: Among the respondents, 8 doctors (26,67%) and 4 students (13,33%) had not used AI in their practice or studies. The analysis was conducted on the remaining 22 doctors and 26 students. The study found that students generally rated the effectiveness of AI higher than physicians did, particularly in areas such as enhancing work and educational experiences. Both groups used AI primarily for information retrieval, with students showing a slightly greater openness to expanding AI's role in education and practice. Despite recognizing the advantages of AI, both groups expressed concerns regarding its accuracy and reliability.\nConclusions: The study indicates that while AI, particularly ChatGPT, is increasingly being adopted in medical education and practice, there is still a level of caution and skepticism among both students and professionals.

    "abstract": "Emergency/trauma radiology artificial intelligence (AI) is maturing along all stages of technology readiness, with research and development (R&D) ranging from data curation and algorithm development to post-market monitoring and retraining.\nTo develop an expert consensus document on best research practices and methodological priorities for emergency/trauma radiology AI.\nA Delphi consensus exercise was conducted by the ASER AI/ML expert panel between 2022-2024. In phase 1, a steering committee (7 panelists) established key themes- curation; validity; human factors; workflow; barriers; future avenues; and ethics- and generated an edited, collated long-list of statements. In phase 2, two Delphi rounds using anonymous RAND/UCLA Likert grading were conducted with web-based data capture (round 1) and a bespoke excel document with literature hyperlinks (round 2). Between rounds, editing and knowledge synthesis helped maximize consensus. Statements reaching \u226580% agreement were included in the final document.\nDelphi rounds 1 and 2 consisted of 81 and 78 items, respectively.18/21 expert panelists (86%) responded to round 1, and 15 to round 2 (17% drop-out). Consensus was reached for 65 statements. Observations were summarized and contextualized.

    "abstract": "Estimating the rate of penetration (ROP) is one of most critical tasks for evaluating the efficiency and profitability of drilling operation, which will aim in decision-making related to well planning, time estimation, cost estimation, bit selection, operational troubles, and logistics in drilling operation. The rise in unconventional resource development underscores the need for accurate ROP prediction to optimize drilling operations in these valuable reserves. ROP prediction and optimization in unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs are challenging due to the formations' heterogeneity, high strength, and brittleness. These reservoirs often involve complex well designs, high pressures, and high temperatures, making it difficult to maintain optimal drilling conditions. This study presents the optimization and validation of the artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the ROP during horizontal drilling through unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs. The ANN model was trained using 34,869 data points from five wells (Well-1 to Well-5) and achieved a high correlation coefficient of 0.96 and an average absolute percentage error (AAPE) of 4.68%. An empirical correlation was developed based on the weights and biases of the optimized ANN model. The empirical correlation performance was rigorously tested with 23,246 data points, representing 40% of the data from the same wells, yielding an AAPE of 4.75% and a correlation coefficient of 0.96. Validation of the developed equation on data from Well-6 further confirmed the model's robustness, maintaining a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and an AAPE of 5.75%. These results demonstrate the ANN model's and empirical equation's accuracy and reliability in predicting the ROP, highlighting their potential to optimize drilling operations in unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the accuracy and feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI) in left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS) analysis as compared to conventional (Manual) and semi-automated (SemiAuto) method in echocardiography (Echo).\nGLS validation was performed on 550 standard Echo exams by expert cardiologists. The performance of a beginner cardiologist without experience of GLS analysis was assessed on a subset of 90 exams. The AI employs fully automated view selection, classification, endocardial border tracing, and calculation of GLS from an entire Echo exam, while SemiAuto requires manual chamber view selection, and Manual involves full user input. Interobserver agreement was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for all three methods. Agreement of measures included Pearson's correlation (R) and Bland-Altman analysis [median bias; limits of agreement (LOA)]. With an 89% feasibility the AI showed good agreement with Manual (R = 0.92, bias = 0.7% and LOA: -3.5 to 4.8%) and with SemiAuto (r = 0.90, bias = 0.10% and LOA: -4.5 to 4%). ICCs for GLS were 1.0 for AI, 0.93 for SemiAuto, and 0.80 for Manual. After the 55th analysis, the beginner showed stable time performance with Manual (171\u2005s), contrasting with the consistent performance of SemiAuto (85-69\u2005s) from the beginning. The highest agreement between beginner and expert readers was achieved with AI (R = 1.00), followed by SemiAuto (R = 0.85) and Manual (R = 0.74).\nAutomated GLS analysis enhances efficiency and accuracy in cardiac diagnostics, particularly for novice users. Integration of automated solutions into routine clinical practice could yield more standardized results.",

    "abstract": "Objectives Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to perceive, understand, and manage emotions effectively, a skill essential in the high-stress environment of healthcare. Research suggests that healthcare professionals with higher EI are better equipped to handle stress, maintain resilience, and make sound judgments under pressure, ultimately enhancing job performance. This paper examines EI's predictive role in managing job performance and resistance to stress among healthcare professionals, aiming to explore how elevated EI may strengthen their coping abilities and contribute to improved stress management, professional judgment, and resilience in challenging work settings. Method This cross-sectional study was conducted among 108 healthcare providers, including doctors, nurses, and allied workers. It used validated questionnaires to collect data using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue) to measure EI, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to determine the level of stress, and other standardized tools to grade job performance and the level of resilience. SPSS analyzed data to find the correlation between EI, stress level, job performance, and resilience.\u00a0IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), was used to analyze data and determine the correlation between EI, stress level, job performance, and resilience. Results The results showed a high positive correlation between EI and job performance, r = 0.601 and resilience r = 0.626, suggesting that higher levels of EI positively determine effective professional outcomes and greater resilience. Besides, EI was shown to have a moderate positive correlation with stress management, r = 0.624, indicating that higher EI levels enhance the capabilities of health professionals to manage stress effectively. Conclusion This research would establish that EI significantly affects the resilience of healthcare professionals to stress and job performance. This means that EI-enhancing programs implemented in healthcare agencies could result in better health outcomes, low burnout, and higher resilience of healthcare workers. The subsequent studies may examine the long-term outcomes of EI on resilience to stress and job performance in various settings.",

    "abstract": "Medication errors, especially in dosage calculation, pose risks in healthcare. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems like ChatGPT and Google Bard may help reduce errors, but their accuracy in providing medication information remains to be evaluated.\nTo evaluate the accuracy of AI systems (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, Google Bard) in providing drug dosage information per Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.\nA set of natural language queries mimicking real-world medical dosage inquiries was presented to the AI systems. Responses were analyzed using a 3-point Likert scale. The analysis, conducted with Python and its libraries, focused on basic statistics, overall system accuracy, and disease-specific and organ system accuracies.\nChatGPT 4 outperformed the other systems, showing the highest rate of correct responses (83.77%) and the best overall weighted accuracy (0.6775). Disease-specific accuracy varied notably across systems, with some diseases being accurately recognized, while others demonstrated significant discrepancies. Organ system accuracy also showed variable results, underscoring system-specific strengths and weaknesses.\nChatGPT 4 demonstrates superior reliability in medical dosage information, yet variations across diseases emphasize the need for ongoing improvements. These results highlight AI's potential in aiding healthcare professionals, urging continuous development for dependable accuracy in critical medical situations.",

    "abstract": "Given the public's tendency to overestimate the capability of artificial intelligence (AI) in surgical outcomes for plastic surgery, this study assesses the accuracy of AI-generated images for breast augmentation and reduction, aiming to determine if AI technology can deliver realistic expectations and can be useful in a surgical context.\nWe used AI platforms GetIMG, Leonardo, and Perchance to create pre- and postsurgery images of breast augmentation and reduction. Board-certified plastic surgeons and plastic surgery residents evaluated these images using 11 metrics and divided them into 2 categories: realism and clinical value. Statistical analysis was conducted using analysis of variance and Tukey honestly significant difference post hoc tests. Images of the nipple-areolar complex were excluded due to AI's nudity restrictions.\nGetIMG (mean \u00b1 SD) (realism: 3.83 \u00b1 0.81, clinical value: 3.13 \u00b1 0.62), Leonardo (realism: 3.30 \u00b1 0.69, clinical value: 2.94 \u00b1 0.47), and Perchance (realism: 2.68 \u00b1 0.77, clinical value: 2.88 \u00b1 0.44) showed comparable realism and clinical value scores with no significant difference (\nThe AI models showed similar performance, with some images accurately predicting postsurgical outcomes, particularly breast size and volume in a bra. Despite this promise, the absence of detailed nipple-areola complex visualization is a significant limitation. Until these features and consistent representations of various body types and skin tones are achievable, the authors advise using actual patient photographs for consultations.",

    "abstract": "The management of thoracic empyema is often complicated by diagnostic delays, recurrence, treatment failures and infections with antibiotic resistant bacteria. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, particularly in clinical decision support, imaging, and diagnostic microbiology raises great expectations in addressing these challenges.\nMachine learning (ML) and AI models have been applied to CT scans and chest X-rays to identify and classify pleural effusions and empyema with greater accuracy. AI-based analyses can identify complex imaging features that are often missed by the human eye, improving diagnostic precision. AI-driven decision-support algorithms could reduce time to diagnosis, improve antibiotic stewardship, and enhance more precise and less invasive surgical therapy, significantly improving clinical outcomes and reducing inpatient hospital stays.\nML and AI can analyse large datasets and recognize complex patterns and thus have the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, preop planning for thoracic surgery, and optimize surgical treatment strategies, antibiotic therapy, antibiotic stewardship, monitoring complications, and long-term patient management outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) is described as the ability to recognise and understand one's own emotions and the emotions of others, and empathically manage emotional responses. While historically not emphasised in undergraduate allied health sciences training, it is increasingly considered an essential graduate trait. This scoping review synthesises existing research on EI outcomes, specifically in undergraduate allied health professions students.\nFour databases were searched in February 2024 using keywords relating to EI and empathy to identify studies published in English from 1990. Eligible studies needed to include assessment and reported outcomes using validated EI tools in health professions students.\nA total of 163 papers met the inclusion criteria. Many studies employed a cross-sectional design (n\u2009=\u2009115). Most studies (n\u2009=\u2009135) focused on undergraduate students studying medicine (n\u2009=\u200962), nursing (n\u2009=\u200980) and dentistry (n\u2009=\u200913), with some studies (n\u2009=\u200921) evaluating more than one discipline. Many studies investigated one discipline only (n\u2009=\u200964 for nursing, n\u2009=\u200950 for medicine) using no comparator undergraduate degree. The most common EI models evaluated from this review were ability-based (n\u2009=\u200977), followed by trait-based models (n\u2009=\u200936) and mixed social-emotional competence (n\u2009=\u200935). Ability model evaluations of EI most commonly utilised the Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSEIT) (n\u2009=\u200944) and the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) (n\u2009=\u200924).\nResearch on EI among undergraduate allied health fields is limited. Existing literature reveals there is some consensus on the importance of EI in healthcare education, but there is considerable variability in how EI is measured. Studies suggest higher levels of EI may correlate with improved student professional skill development in clinical reasoning, empathy and stress management.",

    "abstract": "The sensitivity of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is limited for diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Chest computed tomography (CT) is reported to have high sensitivity; however, given the limited availability of chest CT during a pandemic, the assessment of more readily available imaging, such as chest radiographs, augmented by artificial intelligence may substitute for the detection of the features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.\nWe trained a deep convolutional neural network to detect SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia using publicly available chest radiography imaging data including 8,851 normal, 6,045 pneumonia, and 200 COVID-19 pneumonia radiographs. The entire cohort was divided into training (n = 13,586) and test groups (n = 1510). We assessed the accuracy of prediction with independent external data.\nThe sensitivity and positive predictive values of the assessment by artificial intelligence were 96.8% and 90.9%, respectively. In the first external validation of 204 chest radiographs among 107 patients with confirmed COVID-19, the artificial intelligence algorithm correctly identified 174 (85%) chest radiographs as COVID-19 pneumonia among 97 (91%) patients. In the second external validation with 50 immunocompromised patients with leukemia, the higher probability of the artificial intelligence assessment for COVID-19 was correlated with suggestive features of COVID-19, while the normal chest radiographs were closely correlated with the likelihood of normal chest radiographs by the artificial intelligence prediction.\nThe assessment method by artificial intelligence identified suspicious lung lesions on chest radiographs. This novel approach can identify patients for confirmatory chest CT before the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia.",

In the second external validation with 50 immunocompromised patients with leukemia, the higher probability of the artificial intelligence assessment for COVID-19 was correlated with suggestive features of COVID-19, while the normal chest radiographs were closely correlated with the likelihood of normal chest radiographs by the artificial intelligence prediction.",

    "abstract": "Automated retinal image analysis using Artificial Intelligence (AI) can detect diabetic retinopathy as accurately as human graders, but it is not yet licensed in the NHS Diabetic Eye Screening Programme (DESP) in England. This study aims to assess perceptions of People Living with Diabetes (PLD) and Healthcare Practitioners (HCP) towards AI's introduction in DESP.\nTwo online surveys were co-developed with PLD and HCP from a diverse DESP in North East London. Surveys were validated through interviews across three centres and distributed via DESP centres, charities, and the British Association of Retinal Screeners. A coding framework was used to analyse free-text responses.\n387 (24%) PLD and 98 (37%) HCP provided comments. Themes included trust, workforce impact, the patient-practitioner relationship, AI implementation challenges, and inequalities. Both groups agreed AI in DESP was inevitable, would improve efficiency, and save costs. Concerns included job losses, data security, and AI decision safety. A common misconception was that AI would directly affect patient interactions, though it only processes retinal images.\nLimited understanding of AI was a barrier to acceptance. Educating diverse PLD groups and HCP about AI's accuracy and reliability is crucial to building trust and facilitating its integration into screening practices.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and discern patterns without direct instruction. This review explores cutting-edge developments in microsurgery through the lens of AI applications. By analyzing a wide range of studies, this paper highlights AI's transformative role in enhancing microsurgical techniques and decision-making processes. A systematic literature search was conducted using Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed (2005-2023). Extensive data on ML model function and composition, as well as broader study characteristics, were collected from each study. Study quality was assessed across 7 methodological areas of AI research using an adapted methodological index of nonrandomized studies (MINORS) tool. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. ML was used primarily for prognosis (35%), postoperative assessment (29%), and intraoperative assistance/robotic surgery (24%). Only 2 studies were conducted beyond phase 0 of AI research. Fourteen studies included a training group, but only one of these reported both validation and training sets. ML model performance was assessed most frequently using accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. Scores for the adapted MINORS criteria ranged from 10 to 14 out of 14, with a median of 12. Through collation of all available preclinical and clinical trials, this review suggests the efficacy of ML for various microsurgical applications. Despite this, widespread adoption of this technology remains scarce, currently limited by methodological flaws of individual studies and structural barriers to disruptive technologies. However, with growing evidence supporting its use, microsurgeons should be receptive to implementing ML-incorporated technologies or may risk falling behind other specialties.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is a powerful tool for investigating the relationship between brain function and cognitive processes as it allows for the functional organization of the brain to be captured without relying on a specific task or stimuli. In this paper, we present a novel modeling architecture called BrainRGIN for predicting intelligence (fluid, crystallized and total intelligence) using graph neural networks on rsfMRI derived static functional network connectivity matrices. Extending from the existing graph convolution networks, our approach incorporates a clustering-based embedding and graph isomorphism network in the graph convolutional layer to reflect the nature of the brain sub-network organization and efficient network expression, in combination with TopK pooling and attention-based readout functions. We evaluated our proposed architecture on a large dataset, specifically the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Dataset, and demonstrated its effectiveness in predicting individual differences in intelligence. Our model achieved lower mean squared errors and higher correlation scores than existing relevant graph architectures and other traditional machine learning models for all of the intelligence prediction tasks. The middle frontal gyrus exhibited a significant contribution to both fluid and crystallized intelligence, suggesting their pivotal role in these cognitive processes. Total composite scores identified a diverse set of brain regions to be relevant which underscores the complex nature of total intelligence. Our GitHub implementation is publicly available on https://github.com/bishalth01/BrainRGIN/.",

    "abstract": "Major society guidelines recommend transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as the standard of care for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, predicting treatment response remains challenging.\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) may predict therapeutic responses, this systematic review aims to assess the performance and effectiveness of radiomics and AI-based models in predicting TACE outcomes in patients with HCC.\nA systemic search was conducted on Medline and Embase databases from inception to 7th April 2024. Included studies generated a predictive model for TACE response and evaluated its performance by area under the curve (AUC), specificity, or sensitivity analysis. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, case series and reports, pediatric, and animal studies were excluded. Secondary search of references of included articles ensured comprehensiveness.\n64 articles, with 13,412 TACE-treated patients, were included. AI in pre-treatment CT scans provided value in predicting the efficacy of TACE in HCC treatment. A positive association was observed for AI in pre-treatment MRI scans. Models incorporating radiomics had numerically better performance than those incorporating manual measured radiological variables. 39 studies demonstrated that combined predictive models had numerically better performance than models based solely on imaging or non-imaging features.\nA combined predictive model incorporating clinical features, laboratory investigations, and radiological characteristics may effectively predict response to TACE treatment for HCC.",

    "abstract": "To establish an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered multistep integrated (MSI) radiation therapy (RT) workflow for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and evaluate its feasibility and clinical performance.\nPatients with NPC scheduled for MSI RT workflow were prospectively enrolled. This workflow integrates RT procedures from computed tomography (CT) scan to beam delivery, all performed with the patient on the treatment couch. Workflow performance, tumor response, patient-reported acute toxicities, and quality of life were evaluated.\nFrom March 2022 to October 2023, 120 newly diagnosed, nonmetastatic patients with NPC were enrolled. Of these, 117 completed the workflow with a median duration of 23.2 minutes (range, 16.3-45.8). Median translation errors were 0.2 mm (from CT scan to planning approval) and 0.1 mm (during beam delivery). AI-generated contours required minimal revision for the high-risk clinical target volume and organs at risk, minor revision for the involved cervical lymph nodes and low-risk clinical target volume (median Dice similarity coefficients (DSC), 0.98 and 0.94), and more revision for the gross tumor at the primary site and the involved retropharyngeal lymph nodes (median DSC, 0.84). Of 117 AI-generated plans, 108 (92.3%) passed after the first optimization, with \u226597.8% of target volumes receiving \u2265100% of the prescribed dose. Dosimetric constraints were met for most organs at risk, except the thyroid and submandibular glands. One hundred and fifteen patients achieved a complete response at week 12 post-RT, while 14 patients reported any acute toxicity as \"very severe\" from the start of RT to week 12 post-RT.\nAI-empowered MSI RT workflow for patients with NPC is clinically feasible in a single institutional setting compared with standard, human-based RT workflow.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) about great changes in the field of dentistry, but it has not yet been fully determined in which areas it will make a positive contribution to dentistry students. The objective of our study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of undergraduate students (fourth-year dentistry students [4DS] and final-year dentistry students [5DS]) and AI when examining panoramic radiographs.\nFifty panoramic radiographs and 1602 teeth were examined by 50 4DS who had not received a clinical practice internship, 50 5DS, and an AI application. The participants and the AI application evaluated the teeth seen in each radiograph one by one in terms of caries, fillings, teeth with root canal treatment, periodontal loss, extractions, crowns, teeth with apical lesions, and impacted and extracted teeth. Findings were recorded in an Excel chart. Chi-square analysis was used to compare diagnostic success between the groups.\nThe results indicate that there was a statistically significant difference in the identified accuracy of caries, fillings, and extractions between the AI application and undergraduate students (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Although AI showed more identified accuracy in teeth with apical lesions, impacted teeth, and teeth with root canal treatment than in undergraduate students, there was no significant difference between them (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05).\nAI exhibited better results than undergraduate students especially in the detection of caries and fillings. AI could improve undergraduates' accuracy in detecting caries, fillings, and extractions and help them make accurate treatment decisions. In cases where dentistry students are examining patients using panoramic radiographs, employing AI programs during their clinical training to confirm and strengthen the student's diagnosis may be a promising new development.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used increasingly in image interpretation tasks. Human reliance on technology and bias can cause decision errors. A checklist, used with the AI to mitigate against such biases, may optimise the use of AI technologies and promote good decision hygiene. A checklist to aid radiographic image interpretation for radiographers using AI for image interpretation was formed. This study investigates the effect of a checklist for musculoskeletal (MSK) radiographic image assessment when using AI interpretive assistance.\nRadiographers were asked to interpret five MSK examinations with AI feedback. They were then provided with the checklist and asked to reinterpret the same five examinations with the AI feedback (n\u2009=\u2009140 interpretations). During the interpretation sessions, participants were asked to provide a diagnosis and a confidence level on the diagnosis provided. Participants were then asked to complete a questionnaire to gain feedback on the use of the checklist.\nFourteen radiographers were recruited. Nine participants found the checklist alongside the AI most useful and five participants found the AI element to be most useful on its own. Five participants found the AI feedback to be useful as it helped to critique the radiographic image interpretation more closely and rethink their own initial diagnosis.\nThe checklist for use with AI in MSK image interpretation contained useful elements to the user, but further developments can be made to enhance its use in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "To assess the impact of artificial intelligence iterative reconstruction algorithms (AIIR) on image quality with phantom and clinical studies.\nThe phantom images were reconstructed with the hybrid iterative algorithm (HIR: Karl 3D-3, 5, 7, 9) and AIIR (grades 1-5) algorithm. Noise power spectra (NPS), task transfer functions (TTF) were measured, and additionally sharpness was assessed using a \"blur metric\" procedure. Sixty-two consecutive patients underwent standard-dose and low-dose unenhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans, i.e., SDCT and LDCT groups, respectively. The SDCT images reconstructed using the Karl 3D-5, and the LDCT images reconstructed using the Karl 3D-5 and the AIIR-3 and 5, respectively. CT values, standard deviation (SD), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were assessed for hepatic parenchyma and paravertebral muscles. Images were independently evaluated by two radiologists for image-quality, noise, sharpness, and lesion diagnostic confidence.\nIn the phantom study, AIIR algorithm provided higher TTF\nAIIR reduces radiation dose levels by approximately 78% and still maintains the image quality of unenhanced abdominal CT compared to HIR with SDCT.\nNCT06142539.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis, food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma are among the most common diseases in childhood. They are heterogeneous diseases, can co-exist in their development, and manifest complex associations with other disorders and environmental and hereditary factors. Elucidating these intricacies by identifying clinically distinguishable groups and actionable risk factors will allow for better understanding of the diseases, which will enhance clinical management and benefit society and affected individuals and families. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising tool in this context, enabling discovery of meaningful patterns in complex data. Numerous studies within pediatric allergy have and continue to use AI, primarily to characterize disease endotypes/phenotypes and to develop models to predict future disease outcomes. However, most implementations have used relatively simplistic data from one source, such as questionnaires. In addition, methodological approaches and reporting are lacking. This review provides a practical hands-on guide for conducting AI-based studies in pediatric allergy, including (1) an introduction to essential AI concepts and techniques, (2) a blueprint for structuring analysis pipelines (from selection of variables to interpretation of results), and (3) an overview of common pitfalls and remedies. Furthermore, the state-of-the art in the implementation of AI in pediatric allergy research, as well as implications and future perspectives are discussed.\nAI-based solutions will undoubtedly transform pediatric allergy research, as showcased by promising findings and innovative technical solutions, but to fully harness the potential, methodologically robust implementation of more advanced techniques on richer data will be needed.\n\u2022 Pediatric allergies are heterogeneous and common, inflicting substantial morbidity and societal costs. \u2022 The field of artificial intelligence is undergoing rapid development, with increasing implementation in various fields of medicine and research.\n\u2022 Promising applications of AI in pediatric allergy have been reported, but implementation largely lags behind other fields, particularly in regard to use of advanced algorithms and non-tabular data. Furthermore, lacking reporting on computational approaches hampers evidence synthesis and critical appraisal. \u2022 Multi-center collaborations with multi-omics and rich unstructured data as well as utilization of deep learning algorithms are lacking and will likely provide the most impactful discoveries.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in radiotherapy (RT) are expected to save time and improve quality, but implementation remains limited. Therefore, we used implementation science to develop a format for designing an implementation strategy for AI. This study aimed to (1) apply this format to develop an AI implementation strategy for our center; (2) identify insights gained to enhance AI implementation using this format; and (3) assess the feasibility and acceptability of this format to design a center-specific implementation strategy for departments aiming to implement AI.\nWe created an AI-implementation strategy for our own center using implementation science methods. This included a stakeholder analysis, literature review, and interviews to identify facilitators and barriers, and designed strategies to overcome the barriers. These methods were subsequently used in a workshop with teams from seven Dutch RT centers to develop their own AI-implementation plans. The applicability, appropriateness, and feasibility were evaluated by the workshop participants, and relevant insights for AI implementation were summarized.\nThe stakeholder analysis identified internal (physicians, physicists, RT technicians, information technology, and education) and external (patients and representatives) stakeholders. Barriers and facilitators included concerns about opacity, privacy, data quality, legal aspects, knowledge, trust, stakeholder involvement, ethics, and multidisciplinary collaboration, all integrated into our implementation strategy. The workshop evaluation showed high acceptability (18 participants [90%]), appropriateness (17 participants [85%]), and feasibility (15 participants [75%]) of the implementation strategy. Sixteen participants fully agreed with the format.\nOur study highlights the need for a collaborative approach to implement AI in RT. We designed a strategy to overcome organizational challenges, improve AI integration, and enhance patient care. Workshop feedback indicates the proposed methods are useful for multiple RT centers. Insights gained by applying the methods highlight the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in the development and implementation of AI.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is poised to revolutionize medical education, clinical decision-making, and health care workflow. Despite considerable interest and a surfeit of newly available tools, medical educators largely lack both competencies and guidance on how to incorporate the new and rapidly evolving world of GAI into the core medical school curriculum and experiences of undergraduate medical education. This Scholarly Perspective highlights the need for medical schools to adapt to this new paradigm by implementing policies, governance, and curricula that address the ethical, technical, and pedagogical implications of GAI. The authors recommend creating policies for appropriate GAI use, designed to protect institutional and patient data, and provide students with clarity on the appropriate use of AI for education. The authors suggest that implementing GAI governance at institutions is crucial to create guiding principles on ethical and equitable GAI use and involving students as coinventors of local innovation. The authors argue that providing faculty and learners with tools and training for safe experimentation with GAI and defining competencies for students and faculty are essential. Curricula for GAI should focus on implications of clinical uses. The authors propose a set of new competencies for GAI that build on those already established for AI in general. Given how dynamic the world of GAI is and how quickly new innovations are changing longstanding practices of clinical medicine, it is imperative that the medical education community acts together to share best practices, gather data to assess the impact of GAI education, continuously update the expected competencies of medical students, and help students prepare for a career that will be continually changed by GAI.",

    "abstract": "To audit prospectively the accuracy, time saving and utility of a commercial artificial intelligence auto-contouring tool (AIAC). To assess the reallocation of time released by AIAC.\nWe audited the perceived usefulness (PU), clinical acceptability and reallocation of time during the introduction of a commercial AIAC. The time from CT to plan completion (PPTT) was audited for several pathways.\n248 patients and 32 staff were included in this audit. PU increased with exposure to AIAC (p\u2009<\u20090.05). For 80% of sites AIAC was timesaving and AI contours were clinically acceptable after minor edits. Edits had little impact on doses for the majority of cases. Median PPTT reduced by 5.5 (breast) and 9 (prostate) working days (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Radiographers spent more time on other tasks within planning. Oncologists improved their work-life balance and increased time spent on professional development and research by up to 2\u2009hours per week.\nAll users of AIAC found it a useful tool and it improved their productivity. The contours were high quality and needed little editing. It reduced contouring time and reduced PPTT by several days in some cases. The reallocated time was staff group dependent.\nThe time released by the use of AIAC can lead to a reduction in the PPTT by up to 9 days. It also improves the work-life balance of oncologists by reducing the time spent out of hours contouring.",

    "abstract": "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiation therapy holds promise for addressing challenges, such as healthcare staff shortages, increased efficiency and treatment planning variations. Increased AI adoption has the potential to standardise treatment protocols, enhance quality, improve patient outcomes, and reduce costs. However, drawbacks include impacts on employment and algorithmic biases, making it crucial to navigate trade-offs. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was undertaken to examine the AI-related characteristics radiation oncology professionals think are most important for adoption in radiation therapy treatment planning.\nRadiation oncology professionals completed an online discrete choice experiment to express their preferences about AI systems for radiation therapy planning which were described by five attributes, each with 2-4 levels: accuracy, automation, exploratory ability, compatibility with other systems and impact on workload. The survey also included questions about attitudes to AI. Choices were modelled using mixed logit regression.\nThe survey was completed by 82 respondents. The results showed they preferred AI systems that offer the largest time saving, and that provide explanations of the AI reasoning (both in-depth and basic). They also favoured systems that provide improved contouring precision compared with manual systems. Respondents emphasised the importance of AI systems being cost-effective, while also recognising AI's impact on professional roles, responsibilities, and service delivery.\nThis study provides important information about radiation oncology professionals' priorities for AI in treatment planning. The findings from this study can be used to inform future research on economic evaluations and management perspectives of AI-driven technologies in radiation therapy.",

    "abstract": "The article presents a review of scientific research on the issue of major aspects and far-reaching opportunities for the application of artificial intelligence in modern forensic medicine and forensic dentistry. The purpose of the research is to study the possibilities of application of artificial intelligence in the practice of forensic dental identification of personality based on literature data. Today, the application of artificial intelligence has made it possible to automate work processes, increase the accuracy, speed and efficiency of solving the issues of forensic dentistry, and improve the quality of forensic evidence provided. At the same time, like any technology, artificial intelligence is not without some disadvantages of practical application. In this regard, the opinion is expressed that it is advisable to use artificial intelligence systems only as an auxiliary tool, leaving the primary role in making final decisions to forensic medical examiners. Thus, the potential of development and prospects of practical application of artificial intelligence to solve the issues of forensic dentistry and improve the quality of the provided forensic evidence remain very promising.\n\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445

    "abstract": "The exploration of van der Waals (vdW) materials, renowned for their unique optical properties, is pivotal for advanced photonics. These materials exhibit exceptional optical anisotropy, both in-plane and out-of-plane, making them an ideal platform for novel photonic applications. However, the manual search for vdW materials with giant optical anisotropy is a labor-intensive process unsuitable for the fast screening of materials with unique properties. Here, we leverage geometrical and machine learning (ML) approaches to streamline this search, employing deep learning architectures, including the recently developed Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network. Within the geometrical approach, we clustered vdW materials based on in-plane and out-of-plane birefringence values and correlated optical anisotropy with crystallographic parameters. The more accurate ML model demonstrates high predictive capability, validated through density functional theory and ellipsometry measurements. Experimental verification with 2H-MoTe",

    "abstract": "The rapid escalation of cyber threats necessitates innovative strategies to enhance cybersecurity and privacy measures. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool poised to enhance the effectiveness of cybersecurity strategies by offering advanced capabilities for intrusion detection, malware classification, and privacy preservation. However, this work addresses the significant lack of a comprehensive synthesis of AI's use in cybersecurity and privacy across the vast literature, aiming to identify existing gaps and guide further progress.\nThis study employs the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework for a comprehensive literature review, analyzing over 9,350 publications from 2004 to 2023. Utilizing BERTopic modeling, 14 key themes in AI-driven cybersecurity were identified. Topics were clustered and validated through a combination of algorithmic and expert-driven evaluations, focusing on semantic relationships and coherence scores.\nAI applications in cybersecurity are concentrated around intrusion detection, malware classification, federated learning in privacy, IoT security, UAV systems and DDoS mitigation. Emerging fields such as adversarial machine learning, blockchain and deep learning are gaining traction. Analysis reveals that AI's adaptability and scalability are critical for addressing evolving threats. Global trends indicate significant contributions from the US, India, UK, and China, highlighting geographical diversity in research priorities.\nWhile AI enhances cybersecurity efficacy, challenges such as computational resource demands, adversarial vulnerabilities, and ethical concerns persist. More research in trustworthy AI, standardizing AI-driven methods, legislations for robust privacy protection amongst others is emphasized. The study also highlights key current and future areas of focus, including quantum machine learning, explainable AI, integrating humanized AI and deepfakes.",

    "abstract": "The application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models and algorithms in clinical laboratories is a new inevitable stage of development of laboratory medicine, since in the future, diagnostic and prognostic panels specific to certain diseases will be created from a large amount of laboratory data. Thanks to machine learning (ML), it is possible to analyze a large amount of structured numerical data as well as unstructured digitized images in the field of hematology, cytology and histopathology. Numerous researches refer to the testing of ML models for the purpose of screening various diseases, detecting damage to organ systems, diagnosing malignant diseases, longitudinal monitoring of various biomarkers that would enable predicting the outcome of each patient's treatment. The main advantages of advanced AI in the clinical laboratory are: faster diagnosis using diagnostic and prognostic algorithms, individualization of treatment plans, personalized medicine, better patient treatment outcomes, easier and more precise longitudinal monitoring of biomarkers, ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that causes symptoms such as tremors, sleeplessness, behavioral problems, sensory abnormalities, and impaired mobility, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have been used in recent studies (2015-2023) to improve PD diagnosis by categorizing patients and healthy controls based on similar clinical presentations. This study investigates several datasets, modalities, and data preprocessing techniques from the collected data. Issues are also addressed, with suggestions for future PD research involving subgrouping and connection analysis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), dopamine transporter scan (DaTscan), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) data. We have used different models like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for detecting PD at an early stage. We have used the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset 3D brain images and archived the 86.67%, 94.02%, accuracy of models, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In the dynamic field of ophthalmology, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative tool in managing complex conditions like uveitis. Characterized by diverse inflammatory responses, uveitis presents significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This systematic review explores the role of AI in advancing diagnostic precision, optimizing therapeutic approaches, and improving patient outcomes in uveitis care. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Embase identified over 10,000 articles using primary and secondary keywords related to AI and uveitis. Rigorous screening based on predefined criteria reduced the pool to 52\u00a0high-quality studies, categorized into six themes: diagnostic support algorithms, screening algorithms, standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN), AI applications in management, systemic implications of AI, and limitations with future directions. AI technologies, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), demonstrated proficiency in anterior chamber inflammation detection, vitreous haze grading, and screening for conditions like ocular toxoplasmosis. Despite these advancements, challenges such as dataset quality, algorithmic transparency, and ethical concerns persist. Future research should focus on developing robust, multimodal AI systems and fostering collaboration among academia and industry to ensure equitable, ethical, and effective AI applications. The integration of AI heralds a new era in uveitis management, emphasizing precision medicine and enhanced care delivery.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that severely impacts cognitive function, posing significant physical and psychological burdens on patients and substantial economic challenges to families and society, particularly in aging populations where its prevalence is rising. Current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including pharmacological treatments and non-pharmacological interventions, exhibit considerable limitations in early diagnosis, etiological treatment, and disease management. This study aims to investigate the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the early diagnosis and progression monitoring of AD through a bibliometric analysis of relevant literature. A systematic search in the Web of Science Core Collection identified 530 publications related to AI and AD, consisting of 361 original research articles and 169 review articles, with a notable increase in annual publication rates, particularly between 2019 and 2024. The United States and China emerged as leading contributors, emphasizing the importance of international collaboration. Institutional analysis revealed that Harvard University and Indiana University System are at the forefront, highlighting the role of academic institutions in fostering interdisciplinary research. Furthermore, the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease was identified as the most influential publication outlet. Key highly cited papers provided essential theoretical foundations for ongoing research. This study underscores the growing relevance of AI in AD research and suggests promising avenues for future investigations, particularly in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic strategies through advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques.",

    "abstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving within healthcare, promising improvements in patient care, diagnostic accuracy, and therapeutic interventions. As AI technology becomes more integrated into clinical workflows, understanding healthcare professionals' (HCPs) knowledge, attitudes, and practices concerning AI is crucial, particularly in diverse healthcare environments like South Gujarat. This study evaluates HCPs' understanding, perception, and application of AI at a tertiary care teaching hospital in this region. Methods This observational, cross-sectional study utilized a non-validated, structured questionnaire based on the Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) framework. A convenient sampling technique was employed to recruit 290 HCPs, including consultant doctors, medical faculty, residents, and interns. Data were collected electronically via Google Forms and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results Most participants (176; 60.7%) were junior residents, with notable representation from departments like Pharmacology and Community Medicine. Regarding AI knowledge, 80 (27.6%) of participants reported full awareness, while 182 (62.8%) were partially aware. AI subtype knowledge varied, with 84 (28.9%) identifying \"Self-awareness\" and 50 (17.2%) \"Limited Memory.\" Internet sources were the predominant information source for 171 (58.9%) of participants. Notably, 192 (66.2%) recognized AI's role in saving time and enhancing accuracy, although some expressed concerns about its lack of empathy and ethical implications. Conclusions The findings highlight substantial awareness but varying depths of understanding of AI among HCPs, who are interested in further AI education. Increased educational programs on AI's ethical and practical aspects may enhance AI integration into clinical practice, aiding responsible adoption in healthcare settings.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies (natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition (SR), and machine learning (ML)) can transform clinical documentation in healthcare. This scoping review evaluates the impact of AI on the accuracy and efficiency of clinical\u00a0documentation across various clinical settings (hospital wards, emergency departments, and outpatient clinics). We found 176 articles by applying a specific search string on Ovid. To ensure a more comprehensive search process, we also performed manual searches on PubMed\u00a0and\u00a0BMJ,\u00a0examining\u00a0any\u00a0relevant\u00a0references\u00a0we\u00a0encountered.\u00a0In this way, we were able to add 46 more articles, resulting in 222 articles in total. After removing duplicates, 208 articles were screened. This led to the inclusion of 36 studies. We were mostly interested in articles discussing the impact of AI technologies, such as NLP, ML, and SR, and their accuracy and efficiency in clinical documentation. To ensure that our research reflected recent work, we focused our efforts on studies published in 2019 and beyond. This criterion was pilot-tested beforehand and necessary adjustments were made.\u00a0After comparing screened articles independently, we ensured inter-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa=1.0), and data extraction was completed on these 36 articles. We conducted this study according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. This scoping review shows improvements in clinical documentation using AI technologies, with an emphasis on accuracy and efficiency. There was a reduction in clinician workload, with the streamlining of the documentation processes. Subsequently, doctors also had more time for patient care. However, these articles also raised various challenges surrounding the use of AI in clinical settings. These challenges included the management of errors, legal liability, and integration of AI with electronic health records (EHRs). There were also some ethical concerns regarding the use of AI with patient data. AI shows massive potential for improving the day-to-day work life of doctors across various clinical settings. However, more research is needed to address the many challenges associated with its use. Studies demonstrate improved accuracy and efficiency in clinical documentation\u00a0with the use of AI. With better regulatory frameworks, implementation, and research, AI can significantly reduce the burden placed on doctors by documentation.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of vertebral fractures, accurate diagnosis and prognostication are essential. This study assesses the effectiveness of AI in diagnosing and predicting vertebral fractures through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive search across major databases selected studies utilizing AI for vertebral fracture diagnosis or prognosis. Out of 14,161 studies initially identified, 79 were included, with 40 undergoing meta-analysis. Diagnostic models were stratified by pathology: non-pathological vertebral fractures, osteoporotic vertebral fractures, and vertebral compression fractures. The primary outcome measure was AUROC. AI showed high accuracy in diagnosing and predicting vertebral fractures: predictive AUROC\u2009=\u20090.82, osteoporotic vertebral fracture diagnosis AUROC\u2009=\u20090.92, non-pathological vertebral fracture diagnosis AUROC\u2009=\u20090.85, and vertebral compression fracture diagnosis AUROC\u2009=\u20090.87, all significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Traditional models had the highest median AUROC (0.90) for fracture prediction, while deep learning models excelled in diagnosing all fracture types. High heterogeneity (I\u00b2 > 99%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) indicated significant variation in model design and performance. AI technologies show considerable promise in improving the diagnosis and prognostication of vertebral fractures, with high accuracy. However, observed heterogeneity and study biases necessitate further research. Future efforts should focus on standardizing AI models and validating them across diverse datasets to ensure clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "Robot-Assisted Gait Rehabilitation (RAGR) is an established clinical practice to encourage neuroplasticity in patients with neuromotor disorders. Nevertheless, tasks repetition imposed by robots may induce boredom, affecting clinical outcomes. Thus, quantitative assessment of engagement towards rehabilitation using physiological data and subjective evaluations is increasingly becoming vital. This study aimed at methodologically exploring the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms applied to structured datasets made of heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) features to predict the level of patient engagement during RAGR.\nThe study recruited 46 subjects (38 underage, 10.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0\u00a0years old; 8 adults, 43.0\u2009\u00b1\u200919.0\u00a0years old) with neuromotor impairments, who underwent 15 to 20 RAGR sessions with Lokomat. During 2 or 3 of these sessions, ad hoc questionnaires were administered to both patients and therapists to investigate their perception of a patient's engagement state. Their outcomes were used to build two engagement classification targets: self-perceived and therapist-perceived, both composed of three levels: \"Underchallenged\", \"Minimally Challenged\", and \"Challenged\". Patient's HRV and EDA physiological signals were processed from raw data collected with the Empatica E4 wristband, and 33 features were extracted from the conditioned signals. Performance outcomes of five different AI classifiers were compared for both classification targets. Nested k-fold cross-validation was used to deal with model selection and optimization. Finally, the effects on classifiers performance of three dataset preparation techniques, such as unimodal or bimodal approach, feature reduction, and data augmentation, were also tested.\nThe study found that combining HRV and EDA features into a comprehensive dataset improved the synergistic representation of engagement compared to unimodal datasets. Additionally, feature reduction did not yield any advantages, while data augmentation consistently enhanced classifiers performance. Support Vector Machine and Extreme Gradient Boosting models were found to be the most effective architectures for predicting self-perceived engagement and therapist-perceived engagement, with a macro-averaged F1 score of 95.6% and 95.4%, respectively.\nThe study displayed the effectiveness of psychophysiology-based AI models in predicting rehabilitation engagement, thus promoting their practical application for personalized care and improved clinical health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) represents the most common group of congenital anomalies, constitutes a significant contributor to the burden of non-communicable diseases, highlighting the critical need for improved risk assessment tools. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise in enhancing outcome predictions for congenital cardiac surgery. This study aims to systematically review the utilization of AI in predicting post-operative outcomes in this population.\nFollowing PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search of Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted. Two independent reviewers screened articles based on predefined criteria. Included studies focused on AI models predicting various post-operative outcomes in congenital heart surgery.\nThe review included 35 articles, primarily published within the last four years, indicating growing interest in AI applications. Models predominantly targeted mortality and survival (n\u2009=\u200916), prolonged length of hospital or ICU stay (n\u2009=\u20097), postoperative complications (n\u2009=\u20096), prolonged mechanical ventilatory support time (n\u2009=\u20094), with additional focus on specific outcomes such as peri-ventricular leucomalacia (n\u2009=\u20092) and malnutrition (n\u2009=\u20091). Performance metrics, such as area under the curve (AUC), ranged from 0.52 to 0.997. Notably, these AI models consistently outperformed traditional risk stratification categories. For instance, in assessing the risk of morbidity and mortality, the AI models demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional methods.\nAI-driven prediction models show significant promise in improving outcome predictions for congenital heart surgery. They surpass traditional risk prediction tools not only in immediate postoperative risks but also in long-term outcomes such as 1-year survival and malnutrition. Further studies with robust external validation are necessary to assess the practical applicability of these models in clinical settings. The protocol of this review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024550942).",

    "abstract": "The lung cancer continues to be the primary cause of cancer-related deaths, despite significant advancements in treatment through the introduction of immunological checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). These inhibitors, initially used as monotherapy, are now employed in combined therapies, resulting in improved survival rates. The ICI function by restoring T-cell activity to target tumor cells, but may lead to undesirable immune-related adverse events (irAE), necessitating careful management.\nThe IMPATHI study, a prospective observational study conducted at the Begin Military Hospital, evaluated patient adherence to ePRO-based telemonitoring using the Cureety platform. The study included patients with advanced thoracic cancer receiving immunotherapy. Minors and those who did not consent to digital surveillance were excluded. Patients filled out ePRO questionnaires, and their health status was classified into four levels. The primary objective was compliance evaluation, with secondary objectives including tolerance profile and impact on survival.\nThe study recruited 22 patients, with a median age of 66years. Adenocarcinoma was the most common diagnosis, and 91% of patients had metastatic disease. Patient adherence to the telemonitoring platform was 83.3%, with 64% of responses indicating stable conditions. Common adverse events included asthenia, dyspnea, and joint/muscle pain. The 24-month progression-free survival rate was 79%, and the overall survival rate was 71.1%.\nThe IMPATHI study demonstrates the potential of telemonitoring in the management of lung cancer patients receiving ICI therapy, with high compliance and promising survival outcomes. Telemonitoring offers significant benefits in early detection of adverse events and personalized care to patients. Future efforts should focus on expanding access to telemonitoring for all patients.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is addressing many expectations for healthcare practitioners and patients in oncology. It has the potential to deeply transform medical practices as we know them today: improving early diagnosis by analysing large quantities of medical data, refining personalised treatment plans and optimising patient follow-up. AI also makes it easier to identify new biomarkers and predict responses to therapies, reducing margins of error and speeding up clinical decisions. Among the most popular types of AI to revolutionise clinical practice are language models. In a perfect world, the integration of AI would promote more precise, personalised and efficient care, while relieving healthcare providers of tedious or repetitive tasks, allowing them to concentrate more on providing human support to patients, and all this with a low energy consumption. However, the large-scale deployment of AI currently raises fundamental questions about fairness, safety of use and how to assess the results obtained from AI longitudinally. This article explores how the many applications are evaluated for our practice (spoiler alert: they are currently limited), potential clinical benefits and challenges currently encountered when dealing with the integration of AI into routine oncology care. We will focus on language models whose development has been exploding since 2021.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are widely applied across diverse fields, including nearly all segments of human activity. In healthcare, artificial intelligence techniques have revolutionized disease diagnosis, particularly in image classification. Although these models have achieved significant results, their lack of explainability has limited widespread adoption in clinical practice. In medical environments, understanding AI model decisions is essential not only for healthcare professionals' trust but also for regulatory compliance, patient safety, and accountability in case of failures. Glaucoma, a neurodegenerative eye disease, can lead to irreversible blindness, making early detection crucial for preventing vision loss. Automated glaucoma detection has been a focus of intensive research in computer vision, with numerous studies proposing the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze retinal fundus images and diagnose the disease automatically. However, these models often lack the necessary explainability, which is essential for ophthalmologists to understand and justify their decisions to patients. This paper explores and applies explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to different CNN architectures for glaucoma classification, comparing which explanation technique offers the best interpretive resources for clinical diagnosis. We propose a new approach, SCIM (SHAP-CAM Interpretable Mapping), which has shown promising results. The experiments were conducted with an ophthalmology specialist who highlighted that CAM-based interpretability, applied to the VGG16 and VGG19 architectures, stands out as the most effective resource for promoting interpretability and supporting diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive cardiac testing with coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are becoming alternatives to invasive angiography for the evaluation of obstructive coronary artery disease. We aimed to evaluate whether a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted CCTA program is comparable to SPECT imaging for ischemic testing.\nCCTA images were analyzed using an artificial intelligence convolutional neural network machine-learning-based model, atherosclerosis imaging-quantitative computed tomography (AI-QCT)ISCHEMIA. A total of 183 patients (75 females and 108 males, with an average age of 60.8 years \u00b1 12.3 years) were selected. All patients underwent AI-QCTISCHEMIA-augmented CCTA, with 60 undergoing concurrent SPECT and 16 having invasive coronary angiograms. Eight studies were excluded from analysis due to incomplete data or coronary anomalies.\nA total of 175 patients (95%) had CCTA performed, deemed acceptable for AI-QCTISCHEMIA interpretation. Compared to invasive angiography, AI-QCTISCHEMIA-driven CCTA showed a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 70% for predicting coronary ischemia, versus 70% and 53%, respectively for SPECT. The negative predictive value was high for female patients when using AI-QCTISCHEMIA compared to SPECT (91% vs. 68%, P = 0.042). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves were similar between both modalities (0.81 for AI-CCTA, 0.75 for SPECT, P = 0.526). When comparing both modalities, the correlation coefficient was r = 0.71 (P < 0.04).\nAI-powered CCTA is a viable alternative to SPECT for detecting myocardial ischemia in patients with low- to intermediate-risk coronary artery disease, with significant positive and negative correlation in results. For patients who underwent confirmatory invasive angiography, the results of AI-CCTA and SPECT imaging were comparable. Future research focusing on prospective studies involving larger and more diverse patient populations is warranted to further investigate the benefits offered by AI-driven CCTA.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of lung adenocarcinoma significantly depends on the proportion of solid components in lung nodules. Traditional one-dimensional consolidation tumor ratio (1D CTR) based on ideal, uniformly dense solid components lacks precision. There is no consensus on the CT threshold for evaluating invasiveness using the threshold segmentation method. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of the three-dimensional CTR (3D CTR) calculated by the artificial intelligence threshold segmentation method in predicting invasive stage T1 lung adenocarcinoma and to identify its optimal threshold and cut-off point.\nData from 1,056 patients with 1,179 pulmonary nodules confirmed by postoperative pathology were collected retrospectively from two centers, Zhengzhou People's Hospital and Huadong Hospital of Fudan University. Patients were divided into non-invasive [atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA)] and invasive groups [invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC)]. Seven computed tomography (CT) threshold settings (-550 to 0 HU) were used to calculate the 3D CTR via the threshold segmentation method, and differences between the groups were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to compare predictive performance for invasiveness of stage T1 lung adenocarcinoma, and the optimal threshold and corresponding cut-off value were determined. Subgroup analyses based on nodule size-T1a (\u226410 mm), T1b (>10 to 20 mm), and T1c (>20 to 30 mm)-were also conducted.\nThe CT threshold of -150 Housefield unit (HU) showed the highest predictive efficacy for invasiveness of stage T1 lung adenocarcinoma, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.901 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.883-0.919], sensitivity of 86.878%, and specificity of 77.883%. The optimal cut-off point for 3D CTR was 2.75%. In subgroup analyses, -150 HU remained optimal, with predictive performance increasing with nodule size. For the T1a group, the AUC was 0.887 (95% CI: 0.885-0.919), cut-off value was 2.75%, sensitivity was 77.620%, and specificity was 85.714%. For the T1b group, values were 0.903 (95% CI: 0.875-0.931), cut-off value was 5.4%, sensitivity was 87.671%, and specificity was 80.296%. For the T1c group, values were 0.928 (95% CI: 0.893-0.963), cut-off value was 7.1%, sensitivity was 88.043%, and specificity was 81.176%.\nThis study suggests that setting the CT threshold at -150 HU and using the AI-based threshold segmentation method to calculate the 3D CTR effectively distinguishes whether stage T1 lung adenocarcinoma is invasive, with an optimal cut-off point at 2.75%. Under this threshold, for varying nodule sizes, criteria are proposed: for nodules \u226410 mm with a 3D CTR <2.75%; >10 to 20 mm with a 3D CTR <5.4%; and >20 to 30 mm with a 3D CTR <7.1%, these partially solid nodules can be treated as non-IAC.",

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is a vital aspect of medical image processing, allowing healthcare professionals to conduct precise and comprehensive lesion analyses. Traditional segmentation methods are often labor intensive and influenced by the subjectivity of individual physicians. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed this field by reducing the workload of physicians, and improving the accuracy and efficiency of disease diagnosis. However, conventional AI techniques are not without challenges. Issues such as inexplicability, uncontrollable decision-making processes, and unpredictability can lead to confusion and uncertainty in clinical decision-making. This review explores the evolution of AI in medical image segmentation, focusing on the development and impact of explainable AI (XAI) and trustworthy AI (TAI).\nThis review synthesizes existing literature on traditional segmentation methods, AI-based approaches, and the transition from conventional AI to XAI and TAI. The review highlights the key principles and advancements in XAI that aim to address the shortcomings of conventional AI by enhancing transparency and interpretability. It further examines how TAI builds on XAI to improve the reliability, safety, and accountability of AI systems in medical image segmentation.\nXAI has emerged as a solution to the limitations of conventional AI by providing greater transparency and interpretability, allowing healthcare professionals to better understand and trust AI-driven decisions. However, XAI itself faces challenges, including those related to safety, robustness, and value alignment. TAI has been developed to overcome these challenges, offering a more reliable framework for AI applications in medical image segmentation. By integrating the principles of XAI with enhanced safety and dependability, TAI addresses the critical need for TAI systems in clinical settings.\nTAI presents a promising future for medical image segmentation, combining the benefits of AI with improved reliability and safety. Thus, TAI is a more viable and dependable option for healthcare applications, and could ultimately lead to better clinical outcomes for patients, and advance the field of medical image processing.",

    "abstract": "Extensive research on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics in lung cancer has been published in recent years; however, it is necessary to identify the current status, hotspots, and trends in the field. Thus, this study conducted a bibliometric analysis of relevant studies to investigate the application of AI and radiomics in lung cancer.\nRelated publications were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). CiteSpace generated the associated co-occurrence network maps in terms of institutions, authors, and keywords. Bibliometrix was used to perform a bibliometric analysis of relevant countries/regions and journals. In addition, the collected information was used to generate figures using R.\nA total of 2,989 publications were included in this study, of which 2,804 (93.8%) were articles and 185 (6.2%) were reviews. In 2016, there was a rapid increase in the number of publications in this field. Most of the research originated from China (n=1,365, 45.7%). While Fudan University (n=109, 3.6%) attracted the greatest attention among all institutions. In terms of the authors, Gillies (28 publications, 0.9%) published the greatest number of articles. In terms of the journals, \nThis study used bibliometric methods to analyze the relevant literature to discuss the current research hotspots and future trends in the application of AI and radiomics in lung cancer. This information may help relevant researchers to shape the direction of future studies, such as innovations in AI techniques standardized feature extraction, and extend understandings of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations.",

    "abstract": "Coronary angiography is fundamental for the diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease. Manual quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) is accurate and reproducible; however, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled automated and rapid analysis of medical images, addressing the need for real-time quantitative coronary analysis.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of AI-based QCA (AI-QCA) compared with that via manual QCA and clinician acceptance.\nThis retrospective, single-center study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 was a pilot study comparing AI-QCA with manual QCA and visual estimation. It involved 15 patients who underwent coronary angiography at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital between September 2011 and July 2021. Phase 2 included a larger cohort of 762 patients, with 1002 coronary angiograms analyzed between May 2020 and April 2021.\nIn phase 1, AI-QCA and manual QCA consistency varied among the observers, with AI-QCA showing superior consistency compared with visual estimation. However, a strong correlation between AI-QCA and manual-QCA was found in phase 2. AI-QCA accurately identified and quantitatively analyzed multiple lesions in the major vessels, providing results comparable with those of manual QCA.\nAI-QCA demonstrated high concordance with manual QCA, offering real-time analysis and reduced workload. Therefore, AI-QCA has the potential to be a valuable tool for diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease, necessitating further studies for clinical validation.",

    "abstract": "OpenAI's ChatGPT is a large language model-based artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that can be used to answer unique, user-generated questions without direct training on specific content. Large language models have significant potential in urologic education. We reviewed the primary data surrounding the use of large language models in urology. We also reported findings of our primary study assessing the performance of ChatGPT in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) education.\nFor our primary study, we utilized three professional society guidelines addressing RCC to generate fifteen content questions. These questions were inputted into ChatGPT 3.5. ChatGPT responses along with pre- and post-content assessment questions regarding ChatGPT were then presented to evaluators. Evaluators consisted of four urologic oncologists and four non-clinical staff members. Medline was reviewed for additional studies pertaining to the use of ChatGPT in urologic education.\nWe found that all assessors rated ChatGPT highly on the accuracy and usefulness of information provided with overall mean scores of 3.64 [\u00b10.62 standard deviation (SD)] and 3.58 (\u00b10.75) out of 5, respectively. Clinicians and non-clinicians did not differ in their scoring of responses (P=0.37). Completing content assessment improved confidence in the accuracy of ChatGPT's information (P=0.01) and increased agreement that it should be used for medical education (P=0.007). Attitudes towards use for patient education did not change (P=0.30). We also review the current state of the literature regarding ChatGPT use for patient and trainee education and discuss future steps towards optimization.\nChatGPT has significant potential utility in medical education if it can continue to provide accurate and useful information. We have found it to be a useful adjunct to expert human guidance both for medical trainee and, less so, for patient education. Further work is needed to validate ChatGPT before widespread adoption.",

    "abstract": "Advances in video image analysis and artificial intelligence provide opportunities to transform how patients are evaluated. In this study, we assessed the ability to quantify Zoom video recordings of a standardized neurological examination- the Myasthenia Gravis Core Examination (MG-CE)-designed for telemedicine evaluations.\nWe used Zoom (Zoom Video Communications) videos of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) who underwent the MG-CE. Computer vision, in combination with artificial intelligence methods, was used to develop algorithms to analyze the videos, with a focus on eye and body motions. To assess the examinations involving vocalization, signal processing methods, such as natural language processing (NLP), were developed. A series of algorithms were developed to automatically compute the metrics of the MG-CE.\nA total of 51 patients with MG were assessed, with videos recorded twice on separate days, while 15 control subjects were evaluated once. We successfully quantified the positions of the lids, eyes, and arms and developed respiratory metrics based on breath counts. The cheek puff exercise was found to have limited value for quantification. Technical limitations included variations in illumination, bandwidth, and the fact that the recording was conducted from the examiner's side rather than the patient's side.\nSeveral aspects of the MG-CE can be quantified to produce continuous measurements using standard Zoom video recordings. Further development of the technology will enable trained non-physician healthcare providers to conduct precise examinations of patients with MG outside of conventional clinical settings, including for the purpose of clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "To construct a non-invasive pre-hospital screening model and early based on artificial intelligence algorithms to provide the severity of stroke in patients, provide screening, guidance and early warning for stroke patients and their families, and provide data support for clinical decision-making.\nA retrospective study was conducted. The clinical information of stroke patients (n = 53 793) were extracted from the Yidu cloud big data server system of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University from January 1, 2001 to July 31, 2023. Combined with the results of single factor screening and the opinions of experts with senior professional titles in neurology, the input variable was determined, and the output variable was the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) representing the severity of the disease at admission. Python 3.7 was used to build DeepFM algorithm model, and five data mining models including Logistic regression, CART decision tree, C5.0 decision tree, Bayesian network and deep neural network (DNN) were built at the same time. The original data were randomly divided into 80% training set and 20% test set, which were used to train and test the models, adjust the parameters of each model, respectively calculate the accuracy, sensitivity and F-index of the six models, carry out the comprehensive comparison and evaluation of the model. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) and calibration curve were drawn, compared the prediction performance of DeepFM model and the other five algorithms. In addition, the data of stroke patients (n = 1 028) were extracted from Dalian Central Hospital for external verification of the model.\nA total of 14 015 stroke patients with complete information were selected, including 11 212 in the training set and 2 803 in the testing set. After univariate screening, 14 indicators were included to construct the model, including gender, age, recurrence, physical impairment, facial problems, speech disorders, head reactions, disturbance of consciousness, visual disorders, abnormal cough and swallowing, high risk factor, family history, smoking history and drinking history. DeepFM model adopted the two-order crossover feature. The number of hidden layers in DNN layer was 3. Dropout was used to discard the neurons in the neural network. Rule was used as the activation function. Each layer used Dense full connection. The objective function was random gradient descent. The number of iterations was 15. There were 133 922 training parameters in total. Comparing the predictive value of the six models showed that the accuracy of DeepFM model was 0.951, the sensitivity was 0.992, the specificity was 0.814, the F-index was 0.950, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.916. The accuracy of the other five data mining models was between 0.771-0.780, the sensitivity was between 0.978-0.987, the F-index was between 0.690-0.707, and the AUC was between 0.568-0.639. The calibration curve of the DeepFM model was more aligned with the ideal curve than the other five data mining models. Suggesting that the prediction performance of DeepFM model was the best. External validation was conducted on the DeepFM model, and its accuracy was 0.891, indicating good generalization performance of the model.\nThe pre-hospital non-invasive screening prediction model based on DeepFM can accurately predict the severity grading of stroke patients, and has potential application value in rapid screening and early clinical decision-making of stroke.",

    "abstract": "Research concerning artificial intelligence in breast cancer detection has primarily focused on population screening. However, Hong Kong lacks a population-based screening programme. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of artificial intelligence-based computer-assisted diagnosis (AI-CAD) program in symptomatic clinics in Hong Kong and analyse the impact of radio-pathological breast cancer phenotype on AI-CAD performance.\nIn total, 398 consecutive patients with 414 breast cancers were retrospectively identified from a local, prospectively maintained database managed by two tertiary referral centres between January 2020 and September 2022. The full-field digital mammography images were processed using a commercial AI-CAD algorithm. An abnormality score <30 was considered a false negative, whereas a score of \u226590 indicated a high-score tumour. Abnormality scores were analysed with respect to the clinical and radio-pathological characteristics of breast cancer, tumour-to-breast area ratio (TBAR), and tumour distance from the chest wall for cancers presenting as a mass.\nThe median abnormality score across the 414 breast cancers was 95.6; sensitivity was 91.5% and specificity was 96.3%. High-score cancers were more often palpable, invasive, and presented as masses or architectural distortion (P<0.001). False-negative cancers were smaller, more common in dense breast tissue, and presented as asymmetrical densities (P<0.001). Large tumours with extreme TBARs and locations near the chest wall were associated with lower abnormality scores (P<0.001). Several strengths and limitations of AI-CAD were observed and discussed in detail.\nArtificial intelligence-based computer-assisted diagnosis shows potential value as a tool for breast cancer detection in symptomatic setting, which could provide substantial benefits to patients.",

    "abstract": "Students in higher education often encounter significant academic pressure, which can have profound implications for their mental health and academic performance. The current study employs a two-wave longitudinal design to investigate the dynamic interrelationships among academic stress, academic motivation, emotional intelligence, and mindfulness. The study employed a cross-lagged panel model to investigate the temporal interactions among these four constructs and their influence on the academic experiences of doctoral students. The sample consisted of 643 individuals at Time 1 (September/October 2022), followed by a subsequent assessment involving 413 participants (July/August 2023). Notably, there was an overlap of 373 participants who were evaluated at both time points. The results indicated the presence of substantial reciprocal relationships among the constructs under investigation. The outcomes indicated that elevated emotional intelligence and mindfulness levels are associated with reduced academic stress and enhanced motivation. The implications of this analysis underscore the necessity of facilitating interventions aimed at enhancing emotional intelligence and mindfulness. These components are instrumental in promoting resilience and supporting academic success among students. These longitudinal insights hold significant importance within the academic literature as they elucidate the various stressors doctoral students encounter. Furthermore, this research provides practical implications for educators and policymakers in formulating targeted strategies to enhance student well-being and improve educational outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The transformative feature of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the massive capacity for interpreting and transforming unstructured data into a coherent and meaningful context. In general, the potential that AI will alter traditional approaches to student research and its evaluation appears to be significant. With regard to research in global health, it is important for students and research experts to assess strengths and limitations of GenAI within this space. Thus, the goal of our research was to evaluate the information literacy of GenAI compared to expectations that graduate students meet in writing research papers.\nAfter completing the course, Fundamentals of Global Health (INTH 401) at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Graduate students who successfully completed their required research paper were recruited to compare their original papers with a paper they generated by ChatGPT-4o using the original assignment prompt. Students also completed a Google Forms survey to evaluate different sections of the AI-generated paper (e.g., Adherence to Introduction guidelines, Presentation of three perspectives, Conclusion) and their original papers and their overall satisfaction with the AI work. The original student to ChatGPT-4o comparison also enabled evaluation of narrative elements and references.\nOf the 54 students who completed the required research paper, 28 (51.8%) agreed to collaborate in the comparison project. A summary of the survey responses suggested that students evaluated the AI-generated paper as inferior or similar to their own paper (overall satisfaction average\u2009=\u20092.39 (1.61-3.17); Likert scale: 1 to 5 with lower scores indicating inferiority). Evaluating the average individual student responses for 5 Likert item queries showed that 17 scores were\u2009<\u20092.9; 7 scores were between 3.0 to 3.9; 4 scores were\u2009\u2265\u20094.0, consistent with inferiority of the AI-generated paper. Evaluation of reference selection by ChatGPT-4o (n\u2009=\u2009729 total references) showed that 54% (n\u2009=\u2009396) were authentic, 46% (n\u2009=\u2009333) did not exist. Of the authentic references, 26.5% (105/396) were relevant to the paper narrative; 14.4% of the 729 total references.\nOur findings reveal strengths and limitations on the potential of AI tools to assist in understanding the complexities of global health topics. Strengths mentioned by students included the ability of ChatGPT-4o to produce content very quickly and to suggest topics that they had not considered in the 3-perspective sections of their papers. Consistently presenting up-to-date facts and references, as well as further examining or summarizing the complexities of global health topics, appears to be a current limitation of ChatGPT-4o. Because ChatGPT-4o generated references from highly credible biomedical research journals that did not exist, our findings conclude that ChatGPT-4o failed an important component in using information effectively. Moreover, misrepresenting trusted sources of public health information is highly concerning, particularly given recent experiences from the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently in reporting on the impact of, and response to natural disasters. This is a significant limitation of GenAI's ability to meet information literacy standards expected of graduate students.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has variably affected the stress levels among students. Nursing students, as the reserve force of medical resources and the successors of frontline nursing staff, warrant particular attention regarding their stress levels. This study investigates the relationship between emotional empathy, emotional intelligence, and COVID-19-related stress in nursing students and examines the masking role of emotional intelligence in this relationship.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted from March to June 2023 using multi-stage sampling method to recruit 1126 nursing students from a medical university. Participants completed a demographic information questionnaire, the COVID-19 Student Stress Questionnaire, the Multidimensional Emotional Empathy Scale, and the Trait Meta-Mood Scale. Data were analyzed using t-tests/ one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlations, multiple linear regression, and the PROCESS macro program to examine the relationships between emotional empathy, emotional intelligence, and COVID-19-related stress, as well as the masking role of emotional intelligence.\nStatistically significant differences were observed in COVID-19-related stress scores among nursing students from different residential areas (P\u2009<\u20090.05); Emotional empathy was significantly positively correlated with emotional intelligence and its dimensions. Emotional empathy also showed a significant positive correlation with COVID-19-related stress. Emotional intelligence and its dimensions were significantly negatively correlated with COVID-19-related stress; Emotional empathy and emotional intelligence were significant predictors of COVID-19-related stress; Emotional intelligence and its dimensions demonstrated a masking effect on the relationship between emotional empathy and COVID-19-related stress, with total effect sizes of -0.023 for emotional intelligence, -0.021 for emotional attention, -0.017 for emotional clarity, and -\u20090.018 for emotional repair.\nEmotional empathy and emotional intelligence were significant predictors of COVID-19-related stress among nursing students. Emotional intelligence masked the impact of emotional empathy on COVID-19-related stress. Schools should implement stress management programs for nursing students that focus on enhancing emotional intelligence and moderating excessive emotional empathy. These programs are particularly crucial during public health emergencies to reduce stress levels and promote mental well-being.\nNot applicable.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important in healthcare, with a significant impact on nursing practice. As future healthcare practitioners, nursing students must be prepared to incorporate AI technologies into their job. This study aimed to explore the associated factors with nursing students' intention to use AI.\nDescriptive cross-sectional multi-centre design was used. A convenience sample of 1713 university nursing students from Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates completed a self-reported online instrument divided into five sections covering: (1) demographic sheet, (2) knowledge, (3) attitude, (4) perception and (5) intention questionnaire.\nMost nursing students in Arab countries have moderate levels of knowledge, attitude, perception and intention towards the use of AI. There was a significant positive association between knowledge, attitude, perception and intention towards the use of AI. A\u00a0multivariate regression\u00a0analysis revealed that understanding of AI technologies, self-perception as tech-savvy, age, clinical performance in previous semesters and knowledge of AI were significant and positively correlated with intention.\nThe findings highlight the importance of targeted educational interventions and customised strategies to support AI integration within nursing education settings across Arab countries, equipping future nurses with the necessary skills and knowledge to use AI effectively in their practice.",

    "abstract": "Rectal cancer is a common cancer worldwide and lacks effective prognostic markers. The development of prognostic markers by computational pathology methods has attracted increasing attention. This paper aims to construct a prognostic signature from whole slide images for predicting progression-free survival (PFS) of rectal cancer through an unsupervised artificial intelligence algorithm.\nA total of 238 patients with rectal cancer from two datasets were collected for the development and validation of the prognostic signature. A tumor detection model was built by transfer learning. Then, on the basis of the tumor patches recognized by the tumor detection model, a convolutional autoencoder model was built for decoding the tumor patches into deep latent features. Next, on the basis of the deep latent features, the tumor patches were divided into different clusters. The cluster number and other hyperparameters were optimized by a nested cross-validation method. The percentage of each cluster from the patient's tumor patches, which is hereafter called PCF, was calculated for prognostic signature construction. The prognostic signature was constructed by Cox proportional hazard regression with L2 regularization. Finally, bioinformatic analysis was performed to explore the underlying biological mechanisms of the PCFs.\nThe accuracy of the tumor detection model in distinguishing tumor patches from non-tumor patches achieved 99.3%. The optimal cluster number was determined to be 9. Therfore, 9 PCFs were calculated to construct the prognostic signature. The prognostic signature achieved a concordance index of 0.701 in the validation cohort. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed the prognostic signature had good risk stratification ability. Through the bioinformatic analysis, several PCF-associated genes were identified. These genes were enriched in various gene ontology terms.\nThe developed prognostic signature can effectively predict PFS in patients with rectal cancer and exploration of the underlying biological mechanisms may help to promote its clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "While the link between body growth indices in the first three years of life and neurodevelopment is well established, the relationship between these indicators and intelligence levels in later stages is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the association between various anthropometric indices and Intelligence Quotient in early school-aged children.\nThis cross-sectional study recruited healthy students aged 7 to 8\u00a0years from four primary schools in Tehran, Iran. Measurements included body weight, height, body mass index, arm circumference, waist circumference, and hip circumference. Intelligence Quotient was assessed using the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices Test, with scores standardized by age according to the Raven's manual. Separate univariate linear regression analyses evaluated the association between each anthropometric index and children's Intelligence Quotient scores. Multivariate linear regression analyses were then performed to adjust for potential confounding factors, including the child's sex, age, and parental education levels.\nA cohort of 160 children (80 females), with a mean age of 7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u00a0years, was included in the study. The participants exhibited the following mean anthropometric values: weight 27.7\u2009\u00b1\u20096.5\u00a0kg, height 1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u00a0m, body mass index 17.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4\u00a0kg/m\nThis study indicated no strong relationship between various body measurements and intelligence levels in school-aged children after adjusting the analyses for confounders. This suggests that intelligence in these children may be largely shaped by genetic and sociodemographic factors, with minimal influence from physical growth patterns.",

    "abstract": "The evaluation of drug-gene-disease interactions is key for the identification of drugs effective against disease. However, at present, drugs that are effective against genes that are critical for disease are difficult to identify. Following a disease-centric approach, there is a need to identify genes critical to disease function and find drugs that are effective against them. By contrast, following a drug-centric approach comprises identifying the genes targeted by drugs, and then the diseases in which the identified genes are critical. Both of these processes are complex. Using a gene-centric approach, whereby we identify genes that are effective against the disease and can be targeted by drugs, is much easier. However, how such sets of genes can be identified without specifying either the target diseases or drugs is not known. In this study, a novel artificial intelligence-based approach that employs unsupervised methods and identifies genes without specifying neither diseases nor drugs is presented. To evaluate its feasibility, we applied tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) to perform drug repositioning from protein-protein interactions (PPI) without any other information. Proteins selected by TD-based unsupervised FE include many genes related to cancers, as well as drugs that target the selected proteins. Thus, we were able to identify cancer drugs using only PPI. Because the selected proteins had more interactions, we replaced the selected proteins with hub proteins and found that hub proteins themselves could be used for drug repositioning. In contrast to hub proteins, which can only identify cancer drugs, TD-based unsupervised FE enables the identification of drugs for other diseases. In addition, TD-based unsupervised FE can be used to identify drugs that are effective in in vivo experiments, which is difficult when hub proteins are used. In conclusion, TD-based unsupervised FE is a useful tool for drug repositioning using only PPI without other information.",

    "abstract": "Vaccines development in this millennium started by the milestone work on Neisseria meningitidis B, reporting the invention of Reverse Vaccinology (RV), which allows to identify vaccine candidates (VCs) by screening bacterial pathogens genome or proteome through computational analyses. When NERVE (New Enhanced RV Environment), the first RV software integrating tools to perform the selection of VCs, was released, it prompted further development in the field. However, the problem-solving potential of most, if not all, RV programs is still largely unexploited by experimental vaccinologists that impaired by somehow difficult interfaces, requiring bioinformatic skills.\nWe report here on the development and release of NERVE 2.0 (available at: https://nerve-bio.org ) which keeps the original integrative and modular approach of NERVE, while showing higher predictive performance than its previous version and other web-RV programs (Vaxign and Vaxijen). We renewed some of its modules and added innovative ones, such as Loop-Razor, to recover fragments of promising vaccine candidates or Epitope\u00a0Prediction for the epitope prediction binding affinities and population coverage. Along with two newly built AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based models: ESPAAN and Virulent. To improve user-friendliness, NERVE was shifted to a tutored, web-based interface, with a noSQL-database to consent the user to submit, obtain and retrieve analysis results at any moment.\nWith its redesigned and updated environment, NERVE 2.0 allows customisable and refinable bacterial protein vaccine analyses to all different kinds of users.",

This research aimed to develop an explainable analysis of DM by combining sociodemographic and clinical data with statistical and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques.\nLeveraging a small dataset that includes sociodemographic and clinical profiles of diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, we employed a diverse set of statistical and AI models for predictive purposes and assessment of DM risk factors. The statistical tests used were Student's t-test and Chi-square, while the AI techniques were fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and XGBoost.\nOur statistical models facilitated an in-depth exploration of variable associations, while the resulting AI models demonstrated exceptional efficacy in DM classification. In particular, the XGBoost model showed superior performance in accuracy, sensitivity and specificity with values of 1 for each of these metrics.

    "abstract": "The research aims to assess the effectiveness of artificial intelligence models in predicting the risk level in tulip greenhouses using different varieties. The study was conducted in 2022 in the Almaty region, Panfilov village.\nTwo groups of 10 greenhouses each (area 200 m2) were compared: the control group used standard monitoring methods, while the experimental group employed AI-based monitoring. We applied ANOVA, regression analysis, Bootstrap, and correlation analysis to evaluate the impact of factors on the risk level. The results demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in the risk level in the experimental group, where artificial intelligence models were employed, especially the recurrent neural network \"Expert-Pro.\" A comparison of different tulip varieties revealed differences in their susceptibility to risks. The results provide an opportunity for more effective risk management in greenhouse cultivation.\nThe high accuracy and sensitivity exhibited by the \"Expert-Pro\" model underscore its potential to enhance the productivity and resilience of crops. The research findings justify the theoretical significance of applying artificial intelligence in agriculture and its practical applicability for improving risk management efficiency in greenhouse cultivation conditions.",

We applied ANOVA, regression analysis, Bootstrap, and correlation analysis to evaluate the impact of factors on the risk level. The results demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in the risk level in the experimental group, where artificial intelligence models were employed, especially the recurrent neural network \"Expert-Pro.\" A comparison of different tulip varieties revealed differences in their susceptibility to risks. The results provide an opportunity for more effective risk management in greenhouse cultivation.",

    "abstract": "Progress in developing therapies for the maintenance of endogenous insulin secretion in, or the prevention of, type 1 diabetes has been hindered by limited animal models, the length and cost of clinical trials, difficulties in identifying individuals who will progress faster to a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, and heterogeneous clinical responses in intervention trials. Classic placebo-controlled intervention trials often include monotherapies, broad participant populations and extended follow-up periods focused on clinical endpoints. While this approach remains the 'gold standard' of clinical research, efforts are underway to implement new approaches harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate drug discovery and efficacy testing. Here, we review emerging approaches for repurposing agents used to treat diseases that share pathogenic pathways with type 1 diabetes and selecting synergistic combinations of drugs to maximise therapeutic efficacy. We discuss how emerging multi-omics technologies, including analysis of antigen processing and presentation to adaptive immune cells, may lead to the discovery of novel biomarkers and subsequent translation into antigen-specific immunotherapies. We also discuss the potential for using artificial intelligence to create 'digital twin' models that enable rapid in silico testing of personalised agents as well as dose determination. To conclude, we discuss some limitations of artificial intelligence and machine learning, including issues pertaining to model interpretability and bias, as well as the continued need for validation studies via confirmatory intervention trials.",

    "abstract": "Surgical and neuropathologists continuously search for new and disease-specific features, such as independent predictors of tumor prognosis or determinants of tumor entities and sub-entities. This is a task where artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) systems could significantly contribute to help with tumor outcome prediction and the search for new diagnostic or treatment stratification biomarkers. AI systems are increasingly integrated into routine pathology workflows to improve accuracy, reproducibility, productivity and to reveal difficult-to-see features in complicated histological slides, including the quantification of important markers for tumor grading and staging. In this article, we review the infrastructure needed to facilitate digital and computational pathology. We address the barriers for its full deployment in the clinical setting and describe the use of AI in intraoperative or postoperative settings were frozen or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded materials are used. We also summarize quality assessment issues of slide digitization, new spatial biology approaches, and the determination of specific gene-expression from whole slide images. Finally, we highlight new innovative and future technologies, such as large language models, optical biopsies, and mass spectrometry imaging.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) gains prominence in pathology and medicine, the ethical implications and potential biases within such integrated AI models will require careful scrutiny. Ethics and bias are important considerations in our practice settings, especially as increased number of machine learning (ML) systems are being integrated within our various medical domains. Such machine learning based systems, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in specified tasks such as but not limited to image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. However, the potential bias that may exist within such AI-ML models can also inadvertently lead to unfair and potentially detrimental outcomes. The source of bias within such machine learning models can be due to numerous factors but can be typically put in three main buckets (data bias, development bias and interaction bias). These could be due to the training data, algorithmic bias, feature engineering and selection issues, clinical and institutional bias (i.e. practice variability), reporting bias, and temporal bias (i.e. changes in technology, clinical practice or disease patterns). Therefore despite the potential of these AI-ML applications, their deployment in our day to day practice also raises noteworthy ethical concerns. To address ethics and bias in medicine, a comprehensive evaluation process is required which will encompass all aspects such systems, from model development through clinical deployment. Addressing these biases is crucial to ensure that AI-ML systems remain fair, transparent, and beneficial to all. This review will discuss the relevant ethical and bias considerations in AI-ML specifically within the pathology and medical domain.",

    "abstract": "The first ONTOX Hackathon of the EU Horizon 2020-funded ONTOX project was held on 21-23 April 2024 in Utrecht, The Netherlands (https://ontox-project.eu/hackathon/). This participatory event aimed to collectively advance innovation for human safety through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and hence significantly reduce reliance on animal-based testing. Expert scientists, industry leaders, young investigators, members of animal welfare organisations and academics alike, joined the hackathon. Eight teams were stimulated to find innovative solutions for challenging themes, that were selected based on previous discussions between stakeholders, namely: How to drive the use of AI in chemical risk assessment?; To predict or protect?; How can we secure human health and environmental protection at the same time?; and How can we facilitate the transition from animal tests to full implementation of human-relevant methods? The hackathon ended with a pitching contest, where the teams presented their solutions to a jury. The most promising solutions will be presented to regulatory authorities, industry, academia and non-governmental organisations at the next ONTOX Stakeholder Network meeting and taken up by the ONTOX project in order to tackle the above-mentioned challenges further. This report comprises two parts: The first part highlights some of the lessons learnt during the planning and execution of the hackathon; the second part presents the outcome of the ONTOX Hackathon, which resulted in several innovative and promising solutions based on New Approach Methodologies (NAMs), and outlines ONTOX's intended way forward.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of generative artificial intelligence (AI) may have a profound effect on residency applications. In this study, we explore the abilities of AI-generated letters of recommendation (LORs) by evaluating the accuracy of orthopaedic surgery residency selection committee members to identify LORs written by human or AI authors.\nIn a multicenter, single-blind trial, a total of 45 LORs (15 human, 15 ChatGPT, and 15 Google BARD) were curated. In a random fashion, seven faculty reviewers from four residency programs were asked to grade each of the 45 LORs based on the 11 characteristics outlined in the American Orthopaedic Associations standardized LOR, as well as a 1 to 10 scale on how they would rank the applicant, their desire of having the applicant in the program, and if they thought the letter was generated by a human or AI author. Analysis included descriptives, ordinal regression, and a receiver operator characteristic curve to compare accuracy based on the number of letters reviewed.\nFaculty reviewers correctly identified 40% (42/105) of human-generated and 63% (132/210) of AI-generated letters (P < 0.001), which did not increase over time (AUC 0.451, P = 0.102). When analyzed by perceived author, letters marked as human generated had significantly higher means for all variables (P = 0.01). BARD did markedly better than human authors in accuracy (3.25 [1.79 to 5.92], P < 0.001), adaptability (1.29 [1.02 to 1.65], P = 0.034), and perceived commitment (1.56 [0.99 to 2.47], P < 0.055). Additional analysis controlling for reviewer background showed no differences in outcomes based on experience or familiarity with the AI programs.\nFaculty members were unsuccessful in determining the difference between human-generated and AI-generated LORs 50% of the time, which suggests that AI can generate LORs similarly to human authors. This highlights the importance for selection committees to reconsider the role and influence of LORs on residency applications.",

    "abstract": "The inferior alveolar canal (IAC) is a fundamental mandibular structure. It is important to conduct a precise pre-surgical evaluation of the IAC to prevent complications. Recently, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated potential as a valuable tool for dentists, particularly in the field of oral and maxillofacial radiology.\nThe aim of the study was to compare the segmentation time and accuracy of AI-based IAC segmentation with semi-automatic segmentation performed by a specialist.\nThirty individual IACs from 15 anonymized cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans of patients with at least 1 lower third molar were collected from the database of Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poland. The IACs were segmented by a trainee in the field of oral and maxillofacial radiology using a semi-automatic method and automatically by an AI-based platform (Diagnocat). The resulting segmentations were overlapped with the use of Geomagic Studio, reverse engineering software, and then subjected to a statistical analysis.\nThe AI-based segmentation closely matched the semi-automatic method, with an average deviation of 0.275 \u00b10.475 mm between the overlapped segmentations. The mean segmentation time for the AI-based method (175.00 s) was similar to that of the semi-automatic method (175.67 s).\nThe results of the study indicate that AI-based tools may offer a reliable approach for the segmentation of the IAC in the context of dental pre-surgical planning. However, further comprehensive studies are required to compare the methods and consider their limitations more comprehensively.",

    "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is rising fast. We continually hear about novel AI-based technologies being deployed to aid clinical teams in areas like interpreting medical images, understanding pathology, determining diagnosis, predicting prognosis, and deciding on interventions. The field of surgery, however, has been slower to jump on the AI bandwagon. In this paper, we present Surgical Intelligence, an innovative and fast-developing field involving routine capture and AI-based analysis of endoscopic procedure videos. We discuss the need for documenting surgical video, the potential benefits for training and quality improvement, and the features that allow Surgical Intelligence platforms to provide accessible and effective solutions for medical teams.",

    "abstract": "Adrenoleukodystrophy is a genetic metabolic disorder characterized by a heterogeneous phenotype. Its severe form, known as cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, involves unpredictable cerebral damage and progressive central nervous system deterioration. This rare condition became famous because of a Hollywood movie in which the Italian parents of a child with the condition supposedly discovered a medication for treating the condition. But real life does not emulate movies and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the standard of care for patients diagnosed at an early disease stage. This article describes a patient with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy diagnosed at an advanced disease stage. The literature search aimed to identify therapies to prevent further deterioration suggested autologous hematopoietic stem cell-based gene therapy and metabolic therapies. Consensus is a Chat GPT-based AI tool trained on millions of scientific publications, intended for conducting evidence-based literature searches and analyses. The case presented was used to conduct a parallel literature review using Consensus. While the generated output contained no hallucinations (a problem often seen with other large language models), the quality of the selected articles and their interpretation in the context of the specific case fell short of that achieved by experienced researchers or physicians.",

    "abstract": "A full examination of gastrointestinal tract is an essential prerequisite for effectively detecting gastrointestinal lesions. However, there is a lack of efficient tools to analyze and recognize gastric anatomy locations, preventing the complete portrayal of entire stomach. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in identifying gastric anatomy sites by analyzing esophagogastroduodenoscopy images.\nUsing endoscopic images, we proposed a system called the Artificial Intelligence of Medicine (AIMED) through convolutional neural networks and MobileNetV3-large. The performance of artificial intelligence in the recognition of anatomic sites in esophagogastroduodenoscopy images was evaluated by considering many cases. Primary outcomes included diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\nA total of 160,308 images from 27 categories of the upper endoscopy anatomy classification were included in this retrospective research. As a test group, 16031 esophagogastroduodenoscopy images with 27 categories were used to evaluate AIMED's performance in identifying gastric anatomy sites. The convolutional neural network's accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined to be 99.40%, 91.85%, and 99.69%, respectively.\nThe AIMED system achieved high accuracy with regard to recognizing gastric anatomy sites, and it could assist the operator in enhancing the quality control of the used endoscope. Moreover, it could contribute to a more standardized endoscopic performance. Overall, our findings prove that artificial-intelligence-based systems can be indispensable to the endoscopic revolution (Clinical trial registration number: NCT04384575 (12/05/2020)).",

    "abstract": "Using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based therapies' design, production, and delivery is a novel and promising approach. This review provides an overview of the current applications and challenges of AI for CAR-based therapies and suggests some directions for future research and development. This paper examines some of the recent advances of AI for CAR-based therapies, for example, using deep learning (DL) to design CARs that target multiple antigens and avoid antigen escape; using natural language processing to extract relevant information from clinical reports and literature; using computer vision to analyze the morphology and phenotype of CAR cells; using reinforcement learning to optimize the dose and schedule of CAR infusion; and using AI to predict the efficacy and toxicity of CAR-based therapies. These applications demonstrate the potential of AI to improve the quality and efficiency of CAR-based therapies and to provide personalized and precise treatments for cancer patients. However, there are also some challenges and limitations of using AI for CAR-based therapies, for example, the lack of high-quality and standardized data; the need for validation and verification of AI models; the risk of bias and error in AI outputs; the ethical, legal, and social issues of using AI for health care; and the possible impact of AI on the human role and responsibility in cancer immunotherapy. It is important to establish a multidisciplinary collaboration among researchers, clinicians, regulators, and patients to address these challenges and to ensure the safe and responsible use of AI for CAR-based therapies.",

    "abstract": "The convergence of healthcare and artificial intelligence (AI) introduces a transformative era in medical practice. However, the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare workers concerning the adoption of artificial intelligence in healthcare are currently unknown.\nThe primary objective was to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare professionals in Dhaka city, Bangladesh, regarding the adoption of AI in healthcare.\nA cross-sectional research design was employed, incorporating a dual-method approach to select participants using randomness and convenience sampling techniques. Validity was ensured through a literature review, content validity, and reliability assessment (Cronbach's alpha\u00a0=\u00a00.85), and exploratory factor analysis identified robust underlying factors. Data analysis involved descriptive and inferential statistics, including Fisher's exact tests, multivariate logistic regression, and Pearson correlation analysis, conducted using STATA software, providing a comprehensive understanding of healthcare workers' AI adoption in healthcare.\nThis study revealed that age was a significant factor, with individuals aged 18-25 and 26-35 having higher odds of good knowledge and positive attitudes (AOR 1.56, 95\u00a0% CI 1.12-2.43; AOR 1.42, 95\u00a0% CI 0.98-2.34). Physicians (AOR 1.08, 95\u00a0% CI 0.78-1.89), hospital workers (AOR 1.29, 95\u00a0% CI 0.92-2.09), and full-time employees (AOR 1.45, 95\u00a0% CI 1.12-2.34) exhibited higher odds. Attending AI conferences (AOR 1.27, 95\u00a0% CI 0.92-2.23) and learning through research articles/journals (AOR 1.31, 95\u00a0% CI 0.98-2.09) were positively associated with good knowledge and positive attitudes. This research also emphasized the strong correlations between knowledge and positive attitudes (r\u00a0=\u00a00.89, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), as well as negative attitudes with poor knowledge (r\u00a0=\u00a00.65, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nThe study highlights the critical need for targeted educational interventions to bridge the knowledge gaps among healthcare professionals regarding AI adoption. The findings reveal that younger healthcare workers, those in full-time employment, and individuals with exposure to AI through conferences or research are more likely to possess good knowledge and hold positive attitudes towards AI integration. These results suggest that policies and training programs must be tailored to address specific demographic differences, ensuring that all groups are equipped to engage with AI technologies. Moreover, the study emphasizes the importance of continuous professional development, which could foster a workforce capable of harnessing AI's potential to improve patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Regeneration of oral soft tissue defects, including mucogingival defects associated with the recession or loss of gingival and/or mucosal tissues around teeth and implants, is crucial for restoring oral tissue form, function, and health. This study presents a novel approach using three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting to fabricate individualized grafts with precise size, shape, and layer-by-layer cellular organization. A multicomponent polysaccharide/fibrinogen-based bioink is developed, and bioprinting parameters are optimized to create shape-controlled oral soft tissue (gingival) constructs. Rheological, printability, and shape-fidelity assays, demonstrated the influence of thickener concentration and print parameters on print resolution and shape fidelity. Artificial intelligence (AI)-derived tool enabled streamline the iterative bioprinting parameter optimization and analysis of the interaction between the bioprinting parameters. The cell-laden polysaccharide/fibrinogen-based bioinks exhibited excellent cellular viability and shape fidelity of shape-controlled, full-thickness gingival tissue constructs over the 18-day culture period. While variations in thickener concentrations within the bioink minimally impact the cellular organization and morphogenesis (gingival epithelial, connective tissue, and basement membrane markers), they influence the shape fidelity of the bioprinted constructs. This study represents a significant step toward the biofabrication of personalized soft tissue grafts, offering potential applications in the repair and regeneration of mucogingival defects associated with periodontal disease and dental implants.",

    "abstract": "Based on ideal outcomes of corneal topography following orthokeratology (OK), an innovative machine learning algorithm for corneal refractive therapy (CRT) was developed to investigate the precision of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted OK lens fitting.\nA total of 797 eyes that had been fitted with CRT lenses and demonstrated good lens centration with plus power ring intact in their topography were retrospectively included. A comprehensive AI model included spherical refraction, keratometry readings, eccentricity, corneal astigmatism, horizontal visible iris diameter, inferior-superior index, surface asymmetry index, surface regularity index and 8-mm chordal corneal height difference. A simplified AI model omitted the latter four parameters. Correlation and disparity in predicted lens parameters between the AI prediction and manufacturer's conventional lens fitting method were compared.\nThere was overall no significant difference between AI predicted parameters and the final ordered parameters (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The horizontal return zone depth (RZD1, p\u00a0=\u00a00.022) and vertical return zone depth (RZD2, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) values suggested by the conventional method were significantly lower, while the horizontal landing zone angle (LZA1) was significantly larger (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) than those of the final ordered lens. The AI predicted parameters were significantly correlated to those of the final ordered lens (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), with the correlation coefficients of base curve radius (BCR), RZD1, RZD2, LZA1, vertical LZA (LZA2) and total lens diameter (TD) being 0.958, 0.708, 0.773, 0.697, 0.654 and 0.730, respectively, for the comprehensive AI model. The correlation coefficients were higher in RZD2, LZA1 and TD with the AI model as compared to conventional method.\nCompared with the conventional method, AI predicted lens parameters exhibit less disparity and improved accuracy, with a potential to facilitate more efficient and precise CRT OK lens fitting.",

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) may revolutionize health care, providing solutions that range from enhancing diagnostic accuracy to personalizing treatment plans. However, its rapid and largely unregulated integration into medicine raises ethical concerns related to data integrity, patient safety, and appropriate oversight. One of the primary ethical challenges lies in generative AI's potential to produce misleading or fabricated information, posing risks of misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment recommendations, which underscore the necessity for robust physician oversight. Transparency also remains a critical concern, as the closed-source nature of many large-language models prevents both patients and health care providers from understanding the reasoning behind AI-generated outputs, potentially eroding trust. The lack of regulatory approval for AI as a medical device, combined with concerns around the security of patient-derived data and AI-generated synthetic data, further complicates its safe integration into clinical workflows. Furthermore, synthetic datasets generated by AI, although valuable for augmenting research in areas with scarce data, complicate questions of data ownership, patient consent, and scientific validity. In addition, generative AI's ability to streamline administrative tasks risks depersonalizing care, further distancing providers from patients. These challenges compound the deeper issues plaguing the health care system, including the emphasis of volume and speed over value and expertise. The use of generative AI in medicine brings about mass scaling of synthetic information, thereby necessitating careful adoption to protect patient care and medical advancement. Given these considerations, generative AI applications warrant regulatory and critical scrutiny. Key starting points include establishing strict standards for data security and transparency, implementing oversight akin to institutional review boards to govern data usage, and developing interdisciplinary guidelines that involve developers, clinicians, and ethicists. By addressing these concerns, we can better align generative AI adoption with the core foundations of humanistic health care, preserving patient safety, autonomy, and trust while harnessing AI's transformative potential.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications in digital health, bioengineering, and society have significant material impacts on the environment owing to AI's vast energy demands and energy consumption, carbon footprints, and water usage to cool data centers and generate electricity to power the data centers. Yet, the environmental footprints of AI remain underappreciated and inadequately acknowledged. This is significant, particularly in this era of climate emergency and ongoing threats to planetary energy and water supplies. The vocabulary attached to AI often aims to mimic positive human capacities such as \"warmness\" and \"care.\" However, these attempts to humanize AI and digital technology come with an anthropocentric gaze and blind spots that bracket out the environmental impacts and footprints of AI and privilege humans and technology over nonhuman animals and planetary ecological limits. In medicine, the environmental impacts of large language models range from water consumption and carbon emission to rare mineral usage. This commentary and innovation analysis question and queer the popular imagination of AI and digital technology as things that only exist in the immaterial world of cyberspace. In the course of research on AI in planetary health, we must be cognizant of its materiality, ecological impacts, and massive energy and water demands. We argue that moving away from anthropocentric narratives and vocabulary in AI design and praxis would bode well to live within planetary ecological limits so that AI and emerging digital technologies best serve robust and responsible science and all life on the planet Earth.",

    "abstract": "Using Deep Learning in computer-aided diagnosis systems has been of great interest due to its impressive performance in the general domain and medical domain. However, a notable challenge is the lack of explainability of many advanced models, which poses risks in critical applications such as diagnosing findings in CXR. To address this problem, we propose ItpCtrl-AI, a novel end-to-end interpretable and controllable framework that mirrors the decision-making process of the radiologist. By emulating the eye gaze patterns of radiologists, our framework initially determines the focal areas and assesses the significance of each pixel within those regions. As a result, the model generates an attention heatmap representing radiologists' attention, which is then used to extract attended visual information to diagnose the findings. By allowing the directional input, our framework is controllable by the user. Furthermore, by displaying the eye gaze heatmap which guides the diagnostic conclusion, the underlying rationale behind the model's decision is revealed, thereby making it interpretable. In addition to developing an interpretable and controllable framework, our work includes the creation of a dataset, named Diagnosed-Gaze++, which aligns medical findings with eye gaze data. Our extensive experimentation validates the effectiveness of our approach in generating accurate attention heatmaps and diagnoses. The experimental results show that our model not only accurately identifies medical findings but also precisely produces the eye gaze attention of radiologists. The dataset, models, and source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Single-isocenter multitarget (SIMT) stereotactic-radiosurgery (SRS) has recently emerged as a powerful treatment regimen for intracranial tumors. With high specificity, SIMT SRS allows for rapid, high-dose delivery while maintaining integrity of adjacent healthy tissues and minimizing neurocognitive damage to patients. Highly robust and accurate quality assurance (QA) tests are critical to minimize off-targets and damage to surrounding healthy tissues. We have developed a novel QA phantom, named OneIso, to accurately and precisely measure off-axis accuracy, via off-axis Winston-Lutz (OAWL), to assist SIMT SRS programs. In this study, a comparison of three different quantitative numerical methods were performed for isolating and measuring the position of ball-bearings (BBs) used in the OAWL measurement. The three methods evaluated were: 1) feature extraction technique combined with manual intervention 2) a proprietary software utilizing optical image recognition (OIR) techniques, and 3) a machine learning (ML) model employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These methods were used to analyze OAWL datasets gathered from a OneIso phantom deployed on a Varian TrueBeam. The precision of localizing positional BBs within the OneIso QA phantom, analysis speed, and robustness were compared across the methods. Significantly, the trained ML model utilizing CNNs was found to exhibit superior precision, analysis speed, and efficiency compared to the other two methods. These results highlight the benefit in shifting from manual and OIR methods to that of ML techniques. The incorporation of CNNs in automated QA analysis can achieve improved precision, allowing for more rapid and wider adoption of SIMT SRS for treating intracranial metastases while preserving integrity of surrounding healthy tissues.",

    "abstract": "Balancing surgical margins and functional outcomes is crucial during radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) is a novel, real-time imaging technique that provides histologic images of fresh, unprocessed, and unstained tissue within minutes, which can be interpreted by either humans or artificial intelligence.\nTwenty-two participants underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) with intraoperative SRH surgical bed assessment. Surgeons resected and imaged surgical bed tissue using SRH and adjusted treatment accordingly. An SRH convolutional neural network was developed and tested on 10 consecutive participants. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the surgical team's interpretation were compared with final histopathological assessment.\nA total of 121 SRH periprostatic surgical bed tissue (PSBT) assessments were conducted, an average of 5.5 per participant. The accuracy of the surgical team's SRH interpretation of resected PSBT samples was 98%, with 83% sensitivity and 99% specificity. Intraoperative SRH assessment identified 43% of participants with a pathologic positive surgical margin intraoperatively. PSBT assessment using the convolutional neural network demonstrated no overlap in tumor probability prediction between benign and tumor infiltrated samples, with mean 0.30% (IQR, 0.10%-0.43%) and 26% (IQR, 18%-34%, \nSRH demonstrates potential as a valuable tool for real-time intraoperative assessment of surgical margins during RALP. This technique may improve nerve-sparing surgery and facilitate decision-making for further resection, reducing the risk of positive surgical margins and minimizing the risk of recurrence. Further studies with larger cohorts and longer follow-up periods are warranted to confirm the benefits of SRH in RALP.",

This paper proposes a system leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology combined with Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve policy communication. Addressing challenges of accessibility, complexity, and engagement in traditional dissemination methods, our system uses LLMs and a sophisticated retrieval mechanism to generate accurate, comprehensible responses to citizen queries about policies. This novel integration of RAG and LLMs for policy communication represents a significant advancement over traditional methods, offering unprecedented accuracy and accessibility. We experimented with our system with a diverse dataset of policy documents from both Chinese and US regional governments, comprising over 200 documents across various policy topics. Our system demonstrated high accuracy, averaging 85.58% for Chinese and 90.67% for US policies. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, comprehensibility, and public engagement, measured against expert human responses and baseline comparisons. The system effectively boosted public engagement, with case studies highlighting its impact on transparency and citizen interaction. These results indicate the system's efficacy in making policy information more accessible and understandable, thus enhancing public engagement. This innovative approach aims to build a more informed and participatory democratic process by improving communication between governments and citizens.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is common in patients with obesity and diabetes and can lead to serious complications. This study aimed to evaluate fundus photographs using artificial intelligence to explore the relationships between diabetic retinopathy (DR), MASLD, and related factors. In this cross-sectional study, we included 1,736 patients with a history of diabetes treatment or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of \u22656.5%. All participants were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody and were selected from 33,022 examinees at a health facility in Japan. Fundus photographs were analyzed using RetCAD software, and DR scores were quantified. The presence of DR was determined using two cutoffs: sensitivity (CO20) and specificity (CO50). Steatotic liver (SL) stages were assessed via ultrasound and fibrosis indices and classified into three groups: no SL (SL0), SL with low fibrosis (SL1), and SL with high fibrosis (SL2). Odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of DR associated with each SL stage were calculated using logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, HbA1c, C-reactive protein level, and alcohol consumption. The risk of DR was lower in the SL1 (OR: 0.63, 0.54) and SL2 (OR: 0.64, 0.77) groups compared to the SL0 group at CO20 for both the Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4) and the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS), respectively. Additionally, higher levels of cholinesterase were consistently associated with a reduced risk of DR (FIB-4: OR 0.52, NFS: OR 0.54) at CO50. This study demonstrates that MASLD was associated with a reduced risk of DR, with cholinesterase levels providing further protective effects, highlighting the need for further research into the protective mechanisms and refinement of DR evaluation techniques. The standardized AI evaluation method for DR offers a reliable approach for analyzing retinal changes.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly through the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs), have profoundly impacted healthcare. This study assesses five LLMs-ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, BARD, CLAUDE, and COPILOT-on their response accuracy, clarity, and relevance to queries concerning acute liver failure (ALF). We subsequently compare these results with Chat GPT4 enhanced with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.\nBased on real-world clinical use and the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines, we formulated 16 ALF questions or clinical scenarios to explore LLMs' ability to handle different clinical questions. Using the \"New Chat\" functionality, each query was processed individually across the models to reduce any bias. Additionally, we employed the RAG functionality of GPT-4, which integrates external sources as references to ground the results. All responses were evaluated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 for accuracy, clarity, and relevance by four independent investigators to ensure impartiality.\nChatGPT 4, augmented with RAG, demonstrated superior performance compared to others, consistently scoring the highest (4.70, 4.89, 4.78) across all three domains. ChatGPT 4 exhibited notable proficiency, with scores of 3.67 in accuracy, 4.04 in clarity, and 4.01 in relevance. In contrast, CLAUDE achieved 3.04 in clarity, 3.6 in relevance, and 3.65 in accuracy. Meanwhile, BARD and COPILOT exhibited lower performance levels; BARD recorded scores of 2.01 in accuracy and 3.03 in relevance, while COPILOT obtained 2.26 in accuracy and 3.12 in relevance.\nThe study highlights Chat GPT 4 +RAG's superior performance compared to other LLMs. By integrating RAG with LLMs, the system combines generative language skills with accurate, up-to-date information. This improves response clarity, relevance, and accuracy, making them more effective in healthcare. However, AI models must continually evolve and align with medical practices for successful healthcare integration.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs, play a vital role in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Their discovery has profoundly impacted therapeutic strategies, particularly in cancer treatment, where RNA therapeutics, including miRNA-based targeted therapies, have gained prominence. Advances in RNA sequencing technologies have facilitated a comprehensive exploration of miRNAs-from fundamental research to their diagnostic and prognostic potential in various diseases, notably cancers. However, the manual handling and interpretation of vast RNA datasets pose significant challenges. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized biological research by efficiently extracting insights from complex data. Machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning techniques are effective for identifying critical miRNAs across different cancers and developing prognostic models. Moreover, the integration of AI has led to the creation of comprehensive miRNA databases for identifying mRNA and gene targets, thus facilitating deeper understanding and application in cancer research. This review comprehensively examines current developments in the application of machine learning techniques in miRNA research across diverse cancers. We discuss their roles in identifying biomarkers, elucidating miRNA targets, establishing disease associations, predicting prognostic outcomes, and exploring broader AI applications in cancer research. This review aims to guide researchers in leveraging AI techniques effectively within the miRNA field, thereby accelerating advancements in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "To quantify utilization and impact on documentation time of a large language model-powered ambient artificial intelligence (AI) scribe.\nThis prospective quality improvement study was conducted at a large academic medical center with 45 physicians from 8 ambulatory disciplines over 3 months. Utilization and documentation times were derived from electronic health record (EHR) use measures.\nThe ambient AI scribe was utilized in 9629 of 17\u00a0428 encounters (55.25%) with significant interuser heterogeneity. Compared to baseline, median time per note reduced significantly by 0.57 minutes. Median daily documentation, afterhours, and total EHR time also decreased significantly by 6.89, 5.17, and 19.95 minutes/day, respectively.\nAn early pilot of an ambient AI scribe demonstrated robust utilization and reduced time spent on documentation and in the EHR. There was notable individual-level heterogeneity.\nLarge language model-powered ambient AI scribes may reduce documentation burden. Further studies are needed to identify which users benefit most from current technology and how future iterations can support a broader audience.",

The advent of non-invasive imaging devices, such as line-field confocal optical coherence tomography (LC-OCT), enhances this model by enabling detailed monitoring of skin wound healing over time. Additionally, artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms are revolutionizing the evaluation of clinical images by providing detailed analyses that are unfeasible manually.\nThis study aims to assess the value of combining LC-OCT and AI for evaluating the acute wound healing process in the skin.\nThe forearms of participating volunteers were ablated with a CO\nLC-OCT visualization allows for the characterization of the structural reorganization of the skin during wound healing. The additional integration of AI algorithms significantly enhances the evaluation of the efficacy of wound care interventions by providing a deeper understanding of how these interventions improve wound healing. This is particularly valuable for primary care providers and dermatologists, as AI algorithms have proven useful in observing, characterizing and understanding keratinocyte behaviour.\nThe combination of AI and high-resolution imaging represents a promising tool for better understanding wound healing, evaluating the efficacy of current wound care interventions and analysing keratinocyte behaviour in detail during the wound healing process.\nNCT05614557.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) via machine learning (ML) to analyze the relationship between visual analogue scale foot and ankle (VASFA) and short-form 36 (SF-36) quality of life scores and determine AI's performance over the aforementioned analysis.\nWe collected data from our registry of 819 data units or rows of datasets of foot and ankle patients with VASFA, SF-36 scores, and other demographic data. They were prepared and verified to be a proper input for building ML models using a web-based algorithm platform. After the first ML model was developed using random forest regression, the SF-36 percentage value was set as an endpoint. We developed a second ML model to evaluate it against the current algorithm. This new model employed a gradient-boosting regressor, where we omitted a key parameter, SF_Total, to correct the overfitting. We performed an external validation based on an unseen dataset from 42 data units of patients.\nInternal validity showed an excellent relationship among the VASFA, SF-36 total score, and overall SF-36 percent values at a correlation coefficient (R2 score) of 1.000 based on the random forest regression model of ML (first model: 28XJ). The VASFA percent value of the total score (0=worst; 100=best) demonstrated the dynamic changes in the three zones of the score levels; these were unsatisfactory: \u2264 57.25; borderline: 57.26-80.99; satisfactory: \u2265 81 and could impact the levels of overall SF-36 percent value. A second ML model (model FK13) showed an R2 score of 0.977, which was a great performance. External validation showed no significant difference between the predicted and actual values, with a two-tailed p-value of 0.2136.\nOur ML models predicted excellent relationships among VASFA, with or without SF-36 total score and overall SF-36 percentage values, with evidence from external validation.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health challenge. The existing Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine has limited efficacy in preventing adult pulmonary TB, necessitating the development of new vaccines with improved protective effects.\nComputer-aided design and artificial intelligence technologies, combined with bioinformatics and immunoinformatics approaches, were used to design a multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) against TB. Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses were conducted to evaluate the physicochemical properties, spatial structure, immunogenicity, molecular dynamics (MD), and immunological characteristics of the MEV.\nWe constructed a MEV, designated ZL12138L, containing 13 helper T lymphocyte epitopes, 12 cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes, 8 B-cell epitopes, as well as Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists and helper peptides. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that ZL12138L should exhibit excellent immunogenicity and antigenicity, with no toxicity or allergenicity, and had potential to induce robust immune responses and high solubility, the immunogenicity score was 4.14449, the antigenicity score was 0.8843, and the immunological score was 0.470. Moreover, ZL12138L showed high population coverage for human leukocyte antigen class I and II alleles, reaching 92.41% and 90.17%, respectively, globally. Molecular docking analysis indicated favorable binding affinity of ZL12138L with TLR-2 and TLR-4, with binding energies of -1173.4 and -1360.5 kcal/mol, respectively. Normal mode analysis and MD simulations indicated the stability and dynamic properties of the vaccine construct. Immune simulation predictions suggested that ZL12138L could effectively activate innate and adaptive immune cells, inducing high levels of Type 1 T helper cell cytokines.\nThis study provides compelling evidence for ZL12138L as a promising TB vaccine candidate. Future research will focus on experimental validation and further optimization of the vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) require prompt diagnosis through initial electrocardiograms (ECG), but ECG machines are not always accessible. Meanwhile, smartwatches offering ECG functionality have become widespread. This study evaluates the feasibility of an image-based ECG analysis artificial intelligence (AI) system with smartwatch-based multichannel, asynchronous ECG for diagnosing ACS.\nFifty-six patients with ACS and 15 healthy participants were included, and their standard 12-lead and smartwatch-based 9-lead ECGs were analyzed. The ACS group was categorized into ACS with acute total occlusion (ACS-O(+), culprit stenosis\u00a0\u2265\u00a099\u00a0%, n\u00a0=\u00a044) and ACS without occlusion (ACS-O(-), culprit stenosis 70\u00a0% to\u00a0<\u00a099\u00a0%, n\u00a0=\u00a012) based on coronary angiography. A deep learning-based AI-ECG tool interpreting 2-dimensional ECG images generated probability scores for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (qSTEMI), ACS (qACS), and myocardial injury (qMI: troponin I\u00a0>\u00a00.1\u00a0ng/mL).\nThe AI-driven qSTEMI, qACS, and qMI demonstrated correlation coefficients of 0.882, 0.874, and 0.872 between standard and smartwatch ECGs (all \nAI-ECG scores from standard and smartwatch-based ECGs showed high concordance with comparable diagnostic performance in differentiating ACS-O(+) and ACS-O(-). With increasing accessibility smartwatch accessibility, they may hold promise for aiding ACS diagnosis, regardless of location.",

    "abstract": "Chinese adolescents are facing tremendous academic pressure and challenges brought about by changes in the social environment, which pose a serious threat to their health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This cross-sectional survey uses convenience and snowball sampling to explore the relationship between adolescents' HRQOL and their participation in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).\nThis study subjects include 440 adolescents aged 12 to 18, from four youth training centers and three schools in the central regions of Hunan, Hubei, and Henan provinces, chosen as representative samples for this study. We used AMOS v.26 to construct a structural equation model for data analysis and hypothesis testing.\nThe results indicated that active participation in MVPA helps reduce adolescents' perceived stress and enhances their emotional intelligence and HRQOL levels. Specifically, MVPA weakens adolescents' perceived stress through the mediating role of emotional intelligence (coefficient\u2009=\u2009-0.148, \nThe study results indicate that MVPA has a positive impact on the HRQOL levels of Chinese adolescents. Physical activity, especially moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise, should be considered a strategic approach to maintaining HRQOL among adolescents. Society, schools, and families should create an environment conducive to physical exercise to support adolescents in engaging in physical activities and developing a healthy lifestyle.",

This study focuses on the Dark Triad (DT)-comprising psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism-and its connection with managers' \"Ability\" Emotional Intelligence (AEI). The link between DT (measured through the Dirty Dozen) and managers' AEI (measured through QEPro, an AEI performance test) was examined through a Latent Profile Analysis (LPA). We identified two AEI latent profiles within a heterogeneous population of 231 French managers. Our results show that managers with the FEP (Full Emotional Processing) profile are less Machiavellian (relative to the MEP -Minimal Emotion Processing- profile). Our results show that identifying AEI profiles may be a practical way to prevent toxic Management.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has a significant potential to impact pharmacy practices worldwide. This study investigates pharmacists' perceptions of AI's role in pharmacy practices, their willingness to adopt it, and perceived barriers to its implementation at community pharmacies in Ethiopia.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted among community pharmacists in Ethiopia. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Independent samples \nOf 241 pharmacists approached, 225 (93.3\u00a0%) completed the survey. Overall, about two-thirds (67.1\u00a0% and 66.2\u00a0%) of community pharmacists had a high level of perception and willingness to use AI applications in pharmacy, respectively. Pharmacists with bachelor's degrees and above (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a02.76: 95\u00a0% CI: 0.09, 5.01 vs. \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.79: 95\u00a0% CI: 0.05, 4.21), those who utilized scientific drug information sources (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a02.45, 95\u00a0%: 0.17, 4.45 vs. \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.76, 95\u00a0% CI: 0.91, 3.89), pharmacists who had a previous exposure of AI (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.02, 95\u00a0%: 0.03, 3.24 vs. \u03b2 =1.13, 95\u00a0% CI: 0.07, 2.93), and those who with higher perceived AI knowledge (\u03b2 =1.09, 95\u00a0% CI: 0.02, 2.46 vs. \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.14, 95\u00a0%CI: 0.17, 3.11) had significantly higher perception of AI and willingness to utilize it, respectively compared to their counterparts. Lack of internet availability (89.3\u00a0%), lack of AI-related software/hardware (88.2\u00a0%), and limited training (80.9\u00a0%) were the most frequently reported barriers by pharmacists to AI adoption. Over 90\u00a0% of pharmacists agreed on the importance of internet availability (93.3\u00a0%), policies/frameworks (91.6\u00a0%), and research/learning from others (89.3\u00a0%) for successful AI integration.\nDespite positive perceptions and willingness from pharmacists, AI implementation in community pharmacies could be hindered by resource limitations, training gaps, skill constraints, and infrastructure issues. To facilitate adoption, enhancing knowledge and skills, and developing policies/frameworks are crucial.",

    "abstract": "Many severe aortic stenosis (AS) cases are undetected and/or not considered for potentially life-saving treatment, with a persistent male-bias reported among those undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR). We evaluated the clinical value of a validated artificial intelligence automated alert system (AI-AAS) that detects severe AS from routine echocardiographic measurements. In a retrospective, clinical cohort of 21,749 adults investigated with transthoracic echocardiography at two tertiary-referral centres, we identified 4057 women (aged 61.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.1\u00a0years) and 5132 men (60.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.5\u00a0years) with native aortic valves. We firstly applied the AI-AAS to the cardiologists' reported echo measurements, to detect all AS cases, including guideline-defined severe AS. Two expert clinicians then independently reviewed the original clinical diagnosis/management based on the initial report. Initially, 218/9189 (2.4\u00a0%, 95%CI 2.1-2.7\u00a0%) severe AS cases were diagnosed. The AI-AAS subsequently increased this number by 158 (52\u00a0% women) to 376 cases (4.1\u00a0%, 95%CI 3.7-4.5\u00a0%) of severe guideline-defined AS. Overall, more women were under-diagnosed (92/169 [54.4\u00a0%] versus 80/207 [38.6\u00a0%] men - adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.21, 95%CI 0.10-0.45). Even when accounting for potential contraindications to valvular intervention, women were persistently less likely to be considered for valvular intervention (aOR 0.54, 95%CI 0.31-0.95) and/or underwent AVR (aOR 0.29, 95%CI 0.09-0.74). Our study suggests an AI-AAS application that is agnostic to gender, haemodynamic bias, symptoms, or clinical factors, provides an objective alert to severe forms of AS (including guideline-defined severe AS) following a routine echocardiogram, and has the potential to increase the number of people (especially women) directed towards more definitive treatment/specialist care.",

    "abstract": "The Caribbean small island developing states have limited resources for comprehensive health care provision and are facing an increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases which is driven by an aging regional population. Artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies offer promise for contributing to health care efficiencies, but themselves are dependent on the availability and accessibility of accurate health care data. A regional shortfall in data professionals continues to hamper legislative recognition and promotion of increased data production in Caribbean countries. Tackling the data shortfall will take time and will require a sustainably wider pool of data producers. The data journey map is one approach that can contribute to overcoming such challenges. A data journey map is a process for organizing the collection of health data that focuses on interactions between patient and health care provider. It introduces the idea that data collection is an integral part of the patient journey and that interactions between patient and provider can be enhanced by building data collection into daily health care. A carefully developed and enacted data journey map highlights key points in the care pathway for data collection. These so-called data hotspots can be used to plan - then eventually implement - appropriate AI health care solutions. In this article we introduce the idea of journey mapping, offer an example using cervical cancer prevention and treatment, and discuss the benefits and challenges to implementing such an approach.\nLos peque\u00f1os Estados insulares en desarrollo del Caribe disponen de recursos limitados para la prestaci\u00f3n de servicios de salud integrales, y se enfrentan a una incidencia cada vez mayor de enfermedades no transmisibles como consecuencia del envejecimiento de la poblaci\u00f3n regional. La inteligencia artificial (IA) y otras tecnolog\u00edas digitales son prometedoras para impulsar la eficiencia en la atenci\u00f3n de salud, pero dependen de la disponibilidad y accesibilidad de datos precisos. La escasez de profesionales de la gesti\u00f3n de datos en la regi\u00f3n sigue constituyendo un obst\u00e1culo para el reconocimiento legislativo y la promoci\u00f3n de una mayor generaci\u00f3n de datos en los pa\u00edses del Caribe Solucionar este problema llevar\u00e1 tiempo y requerir\u00e1 contar con un mayor n\u00famero de personas expertas en la generaci\u00f3n de datos. El mapa de trayectorias de datos es un m\u00e9todo que puede contribuir a superar estos desaf\u00edos. Consiste en un proceso para organizar la recopilaci\u00f3n de datos de salud que se centra en las interacciones entre pacientes y prestadores de atenci\u00f3n de salud. Introduce el concepto de que la recopilaci\u00f3n de datos es una parte integral de la trayectoria de los pacientes y de que las interacciones entre pacientes y prestadores de atenci\u00f3n pueden mejorarse mediante la integraci\u00f3n de la recopilaci\u00f3n de datos en la atenci\u00f3n de salud cotidiana. Un mapa del trayectorias de datos elaborado y aplicado de forma cuidadosa permite destacar los puntos clave para la recopilaci\u00f3n de datos en el itinerario de la atenci\u00f3n de salud. Estos denominados \u201cpuntos cr\u00edticos\u201c pueden utilizarse para planificar, y luego aplicar, soluciones de IA adecuadas para la atenci\u00f3n de salud. En este art\u00edculo, presentamos el concepto de la elaboraci\u00f3n de un mapa de trayectorias de datos, mostramos un ejemplo de su uso para la prevenci\u00f3n y el tratamiento del c\u00e1ncer cervicouterino y analizamos los beneficios y los desaf\u00edos de aplicar este m\u00e9todo.\nOs pequenos Estados insulares em desenvolvimento do Caribe t\u00eam recursos limitados para prestar servi\u00e7os de sa\u00fade integrais e enfrentam uma carga cada vez maior de doen\u00e7as n\u00e3o transmiss\u00edveis, agravada pelo envelhecimento da popula\u00e7\u00e3o regional.

    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of postoperative bone graft material changes after the 1-stage sinus lift is crucial for evaluating long-term implant survival. However, traditional manual labeling and segmentation of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images are often inaccurate and inefficient. This study aims to utilize artificial intelligence for automated segmentation of graft material in 1-stage sinus lift procedures to enhance accuracy and efficiency.\nSwin-UPerNet along with mainstream medical segmentation models, such as FCN, U-Net, DeepLabV3, SegFormer, and UPerNet, were trained using a dataset of 120 CBCT scans. The models were tested on 30 CBCT scans to evaluate model performance based on metrics including the 95% Hausdorff distance, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice similarity coefficient. Additionally, processing times were also compared between automated segmentation and manual methods.\nSwin-UPerNet outperformed other models in accuracy, achieving an accuracy rate of 0.84 and mean precision and IoU values of 0.8574 and 0.7373, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The time required for uploading and visualizing segmentation results with Swin-UPerNet significantly decreased to 19.28\u2009s from the average manual segmentation times of 1390\u2009s (p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nSwin-UPerNet exhibited high accuracy and efficiency in identifying and segmenting the three-dimensional volume of bone graft material, indicating significant potential for evaluating the stability of bone graft material.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent sleep-related breathing disorder associated with significant neurocognitive and behavioral impairments. Recent studies have highlighted the role of gut microbiota and the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) in influencing cognitive health in children with OSA. This narrative review aims to summarize current knowledge on the relationship between gut microbiota, MGBA, and cognitive function in pediatric OSA. It also explores the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning in advancing this field and identifying novel therapeutic strategies. Pediatric OSA is associated with gut dysbiosis, reduced microbial diversity, and metabolic disruptions. MGBA mechanisms, such as endocrine, immune, and neural pathways, link gut microbiota to cognitive outcomes. Artificial intelligence and machine learning methodologies offer promising tools to uncover microbial markers and mechanisms associated with cognitive deficits in OSA. Future research should focus on validating these findings through clinical trials and developing personalized therapeutic approaches targeting the gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "The use of drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and other flying vehicles has increased exponentially in the last decade. These devices pose a serious threat to helicopter pilots who constantly seek to maintain situational awareness while flying to avoid objects that might lead to a collision. In this paper, an Airborne Visual Artificial Intelligence System is proposed that seeks to improve helicopter pilots' situational awareness (SA) under UAV-congested environments. Specifically, the system is capable of detecting UAVs, estimating their distance, predicting the probability of collision, and sending an alert to the pilot accordingly. To this end, we aim to combine the strengths of both spatial and temporal deep learning models and classic computer stereo vision to (1) estimate the depth of UAVs, (2) predict potential collisions with other UAVs in the sky, and (3) provide alerts for the pilot with regards to the drone that is likely to collide. The feasibility of integrating artificial intelligence into a comprehensive SA system is herein illustrated and can potentially contribute to the future of autonomous aircraft applications.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) can be understood as a set of traits or abilities that may have an impact on academic, professional, or mental health. The aim of this protocol was to establish methodological guidelines for a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of acute and chronic physical exercise on EI from birth to 21 years (late adolescence).\nThis protocol followed PRISMA-P guidelines and will be modified in PROSPERO after peer review. The review will include experimental randomized and non-randomized control studies involving physical exercise interventions. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCO will be utilized for study selection following the publication of the protocol. The risk of bias will be assessed using the ROBINS-I tool, ROB-2, and the GRADE approach will evaluate the certainty of evidence. Random effect meta-analyses will analyse the effect of physical exercise compared with control groups, using effect sizes measures (Hedges' \nPublication bias will be assessed using Egger's test and the trim-and-fill method. The future results aim to provide a foundation for analysing the impact of physical exercise on EI development, potentially guiding future interventions in health, educational, and related fields.",

    "abstract": "Occupational stress and burnout in the medical field are common factors that can have a negative impact on the quality of clinical care. In the Romanian healthcare environment, there exists important financial difficulties contributing additionally to stress in this study, we aimed to investigate if resilience and emotional intelligence would prove to be protective factors against stress.\nIn our cross-sectional study, we investigated 189 medical professionals, using convenience sampling, from July 2022 to September 2022 in two university centers. We applied a self-reported questionnaire that included socio-demographic characteristics and three scales that measured perceived stress (the Perceived Stress Scale), resilience to stress (the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), and emotional intelligence (the short-form Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire).\nAge was positively associated with resilience levels, meaning that resilience increases with age. While specialist physicians had the highest emotional intelligence score, nurses and other healthcare workers had the highest resilience scores. Perceived stress level was negatively correlated with resilience to stress and with emotional intelligence levels. Resilience to stress was positively correlated with emotional intelligence.\nThe major strength of this study is the finding that resilience to stress mediated the association between perceived stress and emotional intelligence. Because resilience is negatively associated with burnout, resilience to stress and emotional intelligence are potential targets for training aimed at improving the working environment and reducing current levels of burnout in the Romanian Health System and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Mental health disorders are devastating illnesses, often misdiagnosed due to overlapping clinical symptoms. Among these conditions, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder are particularly difficult to distinguish, as they share alternating positive and negative mood symptoms. Accurate and timely diagnosis of these diseases is crucial to ensure effective treatment and to tailor therapeutic management to each individual patient. In this context, it is essential to move beyond standard clinical assessment and employ innovative approaches to identify new biomarkers that can be reliably quantified. We previously identified a panel of RNA editing biomarkers capable of differentiating healthy controls from depressed patients and, among depressed patients, those with major depressive disorder and those with bipolar disorder. In this study, we integrated Adenosine-to-Inosine RNA editing blood biomarkers with clinical data through machine learning algorithms to establish specific signatures for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. This groundbreaking study paves the way for the application of RNA editing in other psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. It represents a first proof-of-concept and provides compelling evidence for the establishment of an RNA editing signature for the diagnosis of these psychiatric conditions.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly population (aged 65 years and over), followed by vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and rare types of neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia. There is an unmet need to improve diagnosis and prognosis for patients with dementia, as cycles of misdiagnosis and diagnostic delays are challenging scenarios in neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroimaging is routinely used in clinical practice to support the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical neuroimaging is amenable to errors owing to varying human judgement as the imaging data are complex and multidimensional. Artificial intelligence algorithms (machine learning and deep learning) enable automation of neuroimaging interpretation and may reduce potential bias and ameliorate clinical decision-making. Graph convolutional network-based frameworks implicitly provide multimodal sparse interpretability to support the detection of Alzheimer's disease and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment. In patients with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, radiologists had significantly better detection performances with both ARIA-E (sensitivity higher in the assisted/deep learning method [87%] compared to unassisted [71%]) and for ARIA-H signs (sensitivity was higher in assisted [79%] compared to unassisted [69%]). A convolutional neural network method was developed, and external validation predicted final clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, or cognitively normal with FDG-PET. The translation of artificial intelligence to clinical practice is plagued with technical, disease-related, and institutional challenges. The implementation of artificial intelligence methods in clinical practice has the potential to transform the diagnostic and treatment landscape and improve patient health and outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Controlling colonoscopic quality is important in the detection of colon polyps during colonoscopy as it reduces the overall long-term colorectal cancer risk. Artificial intelligence has recently been introduced in various medical fields. In this study, we aimed to validate a previously developed artificial intelligence (AI) computer-aided detection (CADe) algorithm called ALPHAON\nWe used the retrospective data of 500 still images, including 100 polyp images and 400 healthy colon images. In addition, we validated the CADe algorithm and compared its diagnostic performance with that of two expert endoscopists and six trainees from Gachon University Gil Medical Center. After a washing-out period of over 2 weeks, endoscopists performed polyp detection on the same dataset with the assistance of ALPHAON\nThe CADe algorithm presented a high capability in detecting colon polyps, with an accuracy of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96 to 0.99), sensitivity of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85 to 0.97), specificity of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97 to 0.99), and AUC of 0.967. When evaluating and comparing the polyp detection ability of ALPHAON\nThe high performance of the CADe algorithm system in colon polyp detection during colonoscopy was verified. The sensitivity of ALPHAON",

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer ranks fifth for incidence and fourth in the leading causes of mortality worldwide. In this study, we aimed to validate previously developed artificial intelligence (AI) computer-aided detection (CADe) algorithm, called ALPHAON\nWe used the retrospective data of 500 still images, including 5 benign gastric ulcers, 95 with gastric cancer, and 400 normal images. Thereby we validated the CADe algorithm measuring accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity with the result of receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) in addition to comparing the diagnostic performance status of four expert endoscopists, four trainees, and four beginners from two university-affiliated hospitals with CADe algorithm. After a washing-out period of over 2 weeks, endoscopists performed gastric detection on the same dataset of the 500 endoscopic images again marked by ALPHAON\nThe CADe algorithm presented high validity in detecting gastric neoplasm with accuracy (0.88, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.91), sensitivity (0.93, 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.98), specificity (0.87, 95% CI: 0.84 to 0.90), and AUC (0.962). After a washing-out period of over 2 weeks, overall validity improved in the trainee and beginner groups with the assistance of ALPHAON\nThe high validation performance state of the CADe algorithm system was verified. Also, ALPHAON",

    "abstract": "Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) is a label-free optical imaging method for rapid intraoperative analysis of fresh tissue samples. Analysis of SRH images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has shown promising results for predicting the main histopathological classes of neurooncological tumors. Due to the relatively low number of rare tumor representations in CNN training datasets, a valid prediction of rarer entities remains limited. To develop new reliable analysis tools, larger datasets and greater tumor variety are crucial. One way to accomplish this is through research biobanks storing frozen tumor tissue samples. However, there is currently no data available regarding the pertinency of previously frozen tissue samples for SRH analysis. The aim of this study was to assess image quality and perform a comparative reliability analysis of artificial intelligence-based tumor classification using SRH in fresh and frozen tissue samples.\nIn a monocentric prospective study, tissue samples from 25 patients undergoing brain tumor resection were obtained. SRH was acquired in fresh and defrosted samples of the same specimen after varying storage durations at -80 \u00b0C. Image quality was rated by an experienced neuropathologist, and prediction of histopathological diagnosis was performed using two established CNNs.\nThe image quality of SRH in fresh and defrosted tissue samples was high, with a mean image quality score of 1.96 (range 1-5) for both groups. CNN analysis showed high internal consistency for histo-(C\u03b1 0.95) and molecular (C\u03b1 0.83) pathological tumor classification. The results were confirmed using a dataset with samples from the local tumor biobank (C\u03b1 0.91 and 0.53).\nOur results showed that SRH appears comparably reliable in fresh and frozen tissue samples, enabling the integration of tumor biobank specimens to potentially improve the diagnostic range and reliability of CNN prediction tools.",

    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is sexually transmitted and commonly widespread in the head and neck region; however, its role in tumor development and prognosis has only been demonstrated for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV-OPSCC). The aim of this review is to analyze the results of the most recent literature that has investigated the use of artificial intelligence (AI) as a method for discerning HPV-positive from HPV-negative OPSCC tumors. A review of the literature was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases, according to PRISMA for scoping review criteria (from 2017 to July 2024). A total of 15 articles and 4063 patients have been included. Eleven studies analyzed the role of radiomics, and four analyzed the role of AI in determining HPV histological positivity. The results of this scoping review indicate that AI has the potential to play a role in predicting HPV positivity or negativity in OPSCC. Further studies are required to confirm these results.",

    "abstract": "Frozen section biopsy, introduced in the early 1900s, still remains the gold standard methodology for rapid histologic evaluations. Although a valuable tool, it is labor-, time-, and cost-intensive. Other challenges include visual and diagnostic variability, which may complicate interpretation and potentially compromise the quality of clinical decisions. Raman spectroscopy, with its high specificity and non-invasive nature, can be an effective tool for dependable and quick histopathology. The most promising modality in this context is stimulated Raman histology (SRH), a label-free, non-linear optical process which generates conventional H&E-like images in short time frames. SRH overcomes limitations of conventional Raman scattering by leveraging the qualities of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), wherein the energy gets transferred from a high-power pump beam to a probe beam, resulting in high-energy, high-intensity scattering. SRH's high resolution and non-requirement of preprocessing steps make it particularly suitable when it comes to intrasurgical histology. Combining SRH with artificial intelligence (AI) can lead to greater precision and less reliance on manual interpretation, potentially easing the burden of the overburdened global histopathology workforce. We review the recent applications and advances in SRH and how it is tapping into AI to evolve as a revolutionary tool for rapid histologic analysis.",

The refractive prediction errors (PEs) were calculated in the entire dataset and subgroups of short eyes (axial length (AL) \u2264 22.5 mm) and long eyes (AL \u2265 25.0 mm). The standard deviation (SD), root-mean-square absolute error (RMSAE), mean absolute error (MAE), median absolute error (MedAE), and percentage of eyes within \u00b10.25 D, \u00b10.50 D, \u00b10.75 D, and \u00b11.00 D of PEs were calculated. Values with ZEISS AI were compared to those from Barrett Universal II (BUII) and Kane. Advanced statistical methods were applied using R.\nA dataset of 10,838 eyes was included. Compared to ZEISS AI, BUII produced significantly greater SDs, RMSAEs, and MAEs in the whole group and short eyes, and the Kane had greater SD, RMSAE, and MAE in short eyes (all adjusted P<0.05); the BUII had significantly lower percentages of eyes within \u00b10.50 D of PEs in the whole group (80.0% vs 81.2%) and in short eyes (71.3% vs. 76.1%), and the Kane had lower percentage of eyes within \u00b10.50 D of PEs in short eyes (71.9% vs. 76.1%) (all adjusted P<0.05).\nThe ZEISS AI IOL Calculator had superior performance compared to the BUII and Kane formulas, especially in short eyes.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to summarize and evaluate the available information regarding the performance of artificial intelligence on dental implant classification and peri-implant pathology identification in 2D radiographs.\nElectronic databases (Medline, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched up to September 2024 for relevant observational studies and both randomized and controlled clinical trials. The search was limited to studies published in English from the last 7 years. Two reviewers independently conducted both study selection and data extraction. Risk of bias assessment was also performed individually by both operators using the Quality Assessment Diagnostic Tool (QUADAS-2).\nOf the 1,465 records identified, 29 references were selected to perform qualitative analysis. The study characteristics were tabulated in a self-designed table. QUADAS-2 tool identified 10 and 15 studies to respectively have a high and an unclear risk of bias, while only four were categorized as low risk of bias. Overall, accuracy rates for dental implant classification ranged from 67 % to 99 %. Peri-implant pathology identification showed results with accuracy detection rates over 78,6 %.\nWhile AI-based models, particularly convolutional neural networks, have shown high accuracy in dental implant classification and peri-implant pathology detection, several limitations must be addressed before widespread clinical application. More advanced AI techniques, such as Federated Learning should be explored to improve the generalizability and efficiency of these models in clinical practice.\nAI-based models offer can and clinicians to accurately classify unknown dental implants and enable early detection of peri-implantitis, improving patient outcomes and streamline treatment planning.",

CT CaScoring VB60, Siemens Healthineers, Forscheim, Germany). CACS was performed by manual (Expert alone), semi-automatic (AI\u2009+\u2009expert review), and automatic (AI alone) methods. Time to complete and intraclass correlation coefficients were the primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints included differences in multiethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) percentiles and stratification by calcium severity. AI and expert CACS agreement was excellent (ICC\u2009=\u20090.951; 95% CI 0.933-0.964). The global median time was 15\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0s for AI (\"Automatic\"), 38\u2009\u00b1\u200913\u00a0s for the AI\u2009+\u2009manual review (\"Semiautomatic\") and 45\u2009\u00b1\u200924\u00a0s for the manual segmentation. Automatic segmentation was faster than manual segmentation for all CACS severities (P\u2009<\u20090.001). AI computational time was independent of calcium burden. Global mean bias in Agatston score across all patients was 7.4\u2009\u00b1\u2009102.6. The mean bias for global MESA score percentile was 2.1% \u00b1 12%. 95% of error corresponded to a\u2009\u00b1\u200910% difference in MESA score. The use of AI for CACS performs excellent accuracy, saves approximately 60% of time in comparison to manual review, and demonstrates low bias for clinical risk profiles. Time benefits are magnified for patients with high CACS. However, a semi-automatic approach is still recommended to minimize potential errors while maintaining efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In this study, artificial intelligence (AI) was used to deeply learn the classification of the anterior segment-Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) images. This AI systems automatically analyzed the angular structure of the AS-OCT images and automatically classified anterior chamber angle. It would improve the efficiency of AS-OCT image analysis.\nThe subjects were from the glaucoma disease screening and prevention project for elderly people in Shanghai community. Each scan contained 72 cross-sectional AS-OCT frames. We developed a deep learning-based AS-OCT image automatic anterior chamber angle analysis software. Classifier performance was evaluated against glaucoma experts' grading of AS-OCT images as standard. Outcome evaluation included accuracy (ACC) and area under the receiver operator curve (AUC).\n94895 AS-OCT images were collected from 687 participants, in which 69,243 images were annotated as open, 16,433 images were annotated as closed, and 9219 images were annotated as non-gradable. The class-balanced train data were formed from randomly extracting the same number of open angle images as the closed angle images, which contained 22,393 images (11127 open, 11256 closed). The best-performing classifier was developed by applying transfer learning to the ResNet-50 architecture. against experts' grading, this classifier achieved an AUC of 0.9635.\nDeep learning classifiers effectively detect angle closure based on automated analysis of AS-OCT images. This system could be used to automate clinical evaluations of the anterior chamber angle and improve efficiency of interpreting AS-OCT images. The results demonstrated the potential of the deep learning system for rapid recognition of high-risk populations of PACD.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in lung cancer screening programs, particularly in the interpretation of computed tomography (CT) scans. The authors acknowledge the benefits of AI, including faster and potentially more accurate analysis of scans, but also raise concerns about clinician trust, transparency, and the deskilling of radiologists due to decreased scan exposure. The rise of AI in medicine and the introduction of national lung cancer screening programs are both increasing contemporarily and naturally the overlap and interplay between the two in the future is ensured. The paper highlights the importance of human-AI collaboration, emphasizing the need for interpretable models and ongoing validation through clinical trials. The promising results and problems uncovered the current pilot studies is explored. Building trust with patients and clinicians is also crucial, considering factors like disease risk perception and the human element of patient interaction. The authors conclude that while AI offers significant promise, widespread adoption hinges on addressing ethical considerations and ensuring a balanced, synergistic relationship between AI and medical professionals. This report aims to provide a talking point to inspire conversations around, and prepare clinicians for the rapidly approaching frontier that is AI in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technology was introduced in medical data area and applied disease prediction models. This study aimed to establish an AI model for predicting lymph node metastasis based on simple medical examinations in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nWe retrospectively analyzed 988 patients with NSCLC who underwent radical pulmonary resection with mediastinal lymph node dissection between January 2011 and October 2022. We collected clinical characteristics including age, sex, smoking history, tumor marker levels, tumor side, segment location, total tumor size, solid tumor size and consolidation-to-tumor ratio, obtainable from medical interview, blood tests and plain computed tomography (CT) of the chest. All patients were randomly classified into a training set (n=790) and a validation set (n=198). Six algorithms including Support Vector Classification (SVC), k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) were created to decide the lymph node metastasis.\nThe GB model showed the best diagnostic performance, with 80.0% accuracy, 95.6% specificity and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.75.\nAn AI model showed high specificity and accuracy for predicting lymph node metastasis. These models have potential to categorize suitable surgical procedures for NSCLC patients without needing contrast-enhanced CT or positron emission tomography.",

    "abstract": "Recently, mandated FDA patient decision checklists were developed with the goal of improving the informed decision-making process for patients considering breast implants. However, these checklists are written at reading levels far higher than recommended by the National Institutes of Health and the American Medical Association. This study aims to improve the accessibility, and therefore, the utility of the mandated FDA patient literature for the average breast implant patient using the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI). Patient decision checklists were obtained from the 3 most utilized breast implant manufacturers in the United States-Allergan, Mentor, and Sientra. A novel patient decision checklist was synthesized by AI, written at the sixth grade reading level, using these checklists as source material. The AI-assisted checklist was edited by plastic surgeons for both formatting and content. The overall readability of Allergan, Mentor, and Sientra patient checklists correlated with the college reading level. These documents were of a statistically significantly higher reading level than the AI-assisted checklist, which was written at the recommended sixth grade level. Text composition analysis similarly demonstrated substantial differences between the AI-assisted and FDA-mandated literature. The currently mandated breast implant patient checklists are written at a college reading level and are inaccessible to the average patient. The authors propose a new patient decision checklist, generated with the assistance of AI, to improve healthcare access within plastic surgery. This simplified material can be used as an adjunct to the current checklists to improve shared decision making.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent hemarthrosis and resultant hemophilic arthropathy are\u00a0significant causes of morbidity in persons with hemophilia, despite the marked evolution of hemophilia care. Prevention, timely diagnosis, and treatment of bleeding episodes are key. However, a physical examination or a patient's assessment of musculoskeletal pain may not accurately identify a joint bleed. This difficulty is compounded as hemophilic arthropathy progresses.\nOur system aims to utilize artificial intelligence and ultrasonography (US; point-of-care and handheld) to enable providers, and ultimately patients, to detect joint bleeds at the bedside and at home. We aimed to develop and assess the reliability of artificial intelligence algorithms in detecting and segmenting synovial recess distension (SRD; an indicator of disease activity) on US images of adult and pediatric knee, elbow, and ankle joints.\nA total of 12,145 joint exams, comprising 61,501 US images from 7 international healthcare centers, were collected. The dataset included healthy participants and adult and pediatric persons with hemophilia, with and without SRD. Images were manually labeled by 2 experts and used to train binary convolutional neural network classifiers and segmentation models. Metrics to evaluate performance included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve.\nThe algorithms exhibited high performance across all joints and all cohorts. Specifically, the knee model showed an accuracy of 97%, sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 97%, and an area under the curve of 0.97 in SRD. High Dice coefficients (80%-85%) were achieved in segmentation tasks across all joints.\nThis technology could assist with the early detection and management of hemarthrosis in hemophilia.",

    "abstract": "Science-informed decisions are best guided by the objective synthesis of the totality of evidence around a particular question and assessing its trustworthiness through systematic processes. However, there are major barriers and challenges that limit science-informed food and nutrition policy, practice, and guidance. First, insufficient evidence, primarily due to acquisition cost of generating high-quality data, and the complexity of the diet-disease relationship. Furthermore, the sheer number of systematic reviews needed across the entire agriculture and food value chain, and the cost and time required to conduct them, can delay the translation of science to policy. Artificial intelligence offers the opportunity to (i) better understand the complex etiology of diet-related chronic diseases, (ii) bring more precision to our understanding of the variation among individuals in the diet-chronic disease relationship, (iii) provide new types of computed data related to the efficacy and effectiveness of nutrition/food interventions in health promotion, and (iv) automate the generation of systematic reviews that support timely decisions. These advances include the acquisition and synthesis of heterogeneous and multimodal datasets. This perspective summarizes a meeting convened at the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The purpose of the meeting was to examine the current state and future potential of artificial intelligence in generating new types of computed data as well as automating the generation of systematic reviews to support evidence-based food and nutrition policy, practice, and guidance.",

These AI systems are particularly effective in analyzing ophthalmic images for early disease detection, improving diagnostic precision, streamlining clinical workflows, and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. This study aims to explore the specific applications and impact of AI in the fields of glaucoma, corneal diseases, and oculoplastics. This study reviews current AI technologies in ophthalmology, examining the implementation of ML and DL techniques. It evaluates AI's role in early disease detection, diagnostic accuracy, clinical workflow enhancement, and patient outcomes. AI has significantly advanced the early detection and management of various ocular conditions. In glaucoma, AI systems provide standardized, rapid identification of disease characteristics, reducing intra- and interobserver bias and workload. For corneal diseases, AI tools enhance diagnostic methods for conditions such as keratitis and keratoconus, improving early detection and treatment planning. In oculoplastics, AI assists in the diagnosis and monitoring of eyelid and orbital diseases, facilitating precise surgical planning and postoperative management. The integration of AI in ophthalmology has revolutionized eye care by enhancing diagnostic precision, streamlining clinical workflows, and improving patient outcomes. As AI technologies continue to evolve, their applications in ophthalmology are expected to expand, offering innovative solutions for the diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, and surgical outcomes of various eye conditions.",

    "abstract": "The time-consuming process of manual contouring of healthy tissue and organs in radiation therapy has prompted the development of computational systems to aid and automate this process, such as artificial intelligence (AI) segmentation and interpolation algorithms. These algorithms are useful in saving time, however, they are not always accurate. Fixing such inaccuracies by editing contours is a manual, time-consuming process as no 'undo' feature currently exists in the most commonly used treatment planning system (TPS). In this short technical report, we present our script for automated de-interpolation to enable faster editing of contours to streamline the adoption of AI-assisted methodologies to enhance clinical workflow.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare communication has rapidly evolved, driven by advancements in large language models (LLMs) such as Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT). This literature review explores AI's role in patient-physician interactions, particularly focusing on its capacity to enhance communication by bridging language barriers, summarizing complex medical data, and offering empathetic responses. AI's strengths lie in its ability to deliver comprehensible, concise, and medically accurate information. Studies indicate AI can outperform human physicians in certain communicative aspects, such as empathy and clarity, with models like ChatGPT and the Medical Pathways Language Model (Med-PaLM) demonstrating high effectiveness in these areas. However, significant challenges remain, including occasional inaccuracies and \"hallucinations,\" where AI-generated content is irrelevant or medically inaccurate. These limitations highlight the need for continued refinement in AI algorithms to ensure reliability and consistency in sensitive healthcare settings. The review underscores the potential of AI as a transformative tool in health communication while advocating for further research and policy development to mitigate risks and enhance AI's integration into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, excel at interpreting unstructured data from public sources, yet are limited when responding to queries on private repositories, such as electronic health records (EHRs). We hypothesized that prompt engineering could enhance the accuracy of LLMs for interpreting EHR data without requiring domain knowledge, thus expanding their utility for patients and personalized diagnostics.\nWe designed and systematically tested prompt engineering techniques to improve the ability of LLMs to interpret EHRs for nuanced diagnostic questions, referenced to a panel of medical experts. In 490 full-text EHR notes from 125 patients with prior life-threatening heart rhythm disorders, we asked GPT-4-turbo to identify recurrent arrhythmias distinct from prior events and tested 220\u2005563 queries. To provide context, results were compared with rule-based natural language processing and BERT-based language models. Experiments were repeated for 2 additional LLMs.\nIn an independent hold-out set of 389 notes, GPT-4-turbo had a balanced accuracy of 64.3%\u00b14.7% out-of-the-box at baseline. This increased when asking GPT-4-turbo to provide a rationale for its answers, requiring a structured data output, and providing in-context exemplars, rose to a balanced accuracy of 91.4%\u00b13.8% (\nThe use of prompt engineering strategies enables LLMs to identify clinical end points from EHRs with an accuracy that surpassed natural language processing and approximated experts, yet without the need for expert knowledge. These approaches could be applied to LLM queries for other domains, to facilitate automated analysis of nuanced data sets with high accuracy by nonexperts.",

    "abstract": "This research study synthesizes research on applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to transform and improve quality of life for deaf and hard of hearing students. Twenty studies were analyzed, spanning domains including AI-enabled captioning, interpreters, personalized tutors, social robots, and assistive apps. Key findings demonstrate emerging AI innovations show promise for enhancing communication, learning, inclusion, and independence for deaf and hard of hearing youth. Technologies such as automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and intelligent tutoring systems increased classroom participation and academic skills by removing barriers. However, small samples, lack of longitudinal data, and technology accessibility limitations affect the strength of conclusions. Additional rigorous comparative research is warranted, but cautious adoption of AI appears beneficial if implemented ethically. With thoughtful design and integration, AI technologies exhibit strong potential for creating more empowering, equitable learning for deaf and hard of hearing students. However, achieving an inclusive AI future requires ongoing collaboration among developers, researchers, and educators to ensure that innovations are leveraged to amplify capacities, not replace them.",

    "abstract": "Tanzania has the highest age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa. Diabetic retinopathy, a common complication, is a significant cause of vision loss; but with effective screening and treatment this often can be prevented. However, with very few specialist eye care staff in Tanzania this is a major challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, which automate clinical decision making and therefore task-shift away from specialist staff, could contribute to improved diabetic retinopathy screening services in low-resource settings. This article describes our experiences of selecting, procuring and implementing an AI system into a regional diabetic eye screening programme in northern Tanzania.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in the occurrence and progression of cancer. The efficient isolation and analysis of EVs for early cancer diagnosis and prognosis have gained significant attention. In this study, for the first time, a rapid and visually detectable method termed freeze-thaw-induced floating patterns of gold nanoparticles (FTFPA) is proposed, which surpasses current state-of-the-art technologies by achieving a 100 fold improvement in the limit of detection of EVs. Notably, it allows for multi-dimensional visualizations of EVs through site-specific oligonucleotide incorporation. This capability empowers FTFPA to accurately identify EVs derived from subtypes of breast cancers with artificial intelligence algorithms. Intriguingly, learning the freezing-thawing-microstructures of EVs with a random forest algorithm is not only able to distinguish their original cell lines (with an accuracy of 95.56%), but also succeed in processing clinical samples (n = 156) to identify EVs by their healthy donors, breast lump and breast cancer subtypes (Luminal A, Triple-negative breast cancer, and Luminal B) with an accuracy of 83.33%. Therefore, this AI-empowered micro-visualization method establishes a rapid and precise point-of-care platform that is applicable to both fundamental research and clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Urinalysis, an essential diagnostic tool, faces challenges in terms of standardization and accuracy. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) with mobile technology can potentially solve these challenges. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness and accuracy of an AI-based program in automatically interpreting urine test strips using mobile phone cameras, an approach that may revolutionize point-of-care testing.\nWe developed novel urine test strips and an AI algorithm for image capture. Sample images from the Chungnam National University Sejong Hospital were collected to train a k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm to read the strips. A mobile application was developed for image capturing and processing. We assessed the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC area under the curve for 10 parameters.\nIn total, 2,612 urine test strip images were collected. The AI algorithm demonstrated 98.7% accuracy in detecting urinary nitrite and 97.3% accuracy in detecting urinary glucose. The sensitivity and specificity were high for most parameters. However, this system could not reliably determine the specific gravity. The optimal time for capturing the test strip results was 75 secs after dipping.\nThe AI-based program accurately interpreted urine test strips using smartphone cameras, offering an accessible and efficient method for urinalysis. This system can be used for immediate analysis and remote testing. Further research is warranted to refine test parameters such as specific gravity to enhance accuracy and reliability.",

    "abstract": "Diagnostic errors in health care pose significant risks to patient safety and are disturbingly common. In the emergency department (ED), the chaotic and high-pressure environment increases the likelihood of these errors, as emergency clinicians must make rapid decisions with limited information, often under cognitive overload. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising solutions to improve diagnostic errors in three key areas: information gathering, clinical decision support (CDS), and feedback through quality improvement. AI can streamline the information-gathering process by automating data retrieval, reducing cognitive load, and providing clinicians with essential patient details quickly. AI-driven CDS systems enhance diagnostic decision making by offering real-time insights, reducing cognitive biases, and prioritizing differential diagnoses. Furthermore, AI-powered feedback loops can facilitate continuous learning and refinement of diagnostic processes by providing targeted education and outcome feedback to clinicians. By integrating AI into these areas, the potential for reducing diagnostic errors and improving patient safety in the ED is substantial. However, successfully implementing AI in the ED is challenging and complex. Developing, validating, and implementing AI as a safe, human-centered ED tool requires thoughtful design and meticulous attention to ethical and practical considerations. Clinicians and patients must be integrated as key stakeholders across these processes. Ultimately, AI should be seen as a tool that assists clinicians by supporting better, faster decisions and thus enhances patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The current study focused on the development of crosslinked hydrogel microneedle patches (cHMNs) incorporating 5-FU-hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex-loaded flexible PEGylated liposomes (5-FU-HP\u03b2CD-loaded FP-LPs) to enhance treatment efficacy and reduce drug toxicity. The research utilized artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to design, optimize, and evaluate the cHMNs. Various AI models were assessed for accuracy, with metrics such as root mean square error and coefficient of determination guiding the selection of the most effective formulation. The physicochemical and mechanical properties, swelling behavior, in vitro skin permeation, and safety of the chosen cHMNs were tested. The results demonstrated that the 5-FU-HP\u03b2CD-loaded FP-LPs, stabilized with limonene, had an optimal particle size of 36.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.42\u00a0nm, narrow size distribution, and zeta potential of -10.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37\u00a0mV, with high encapsulation efficiency. The cHMNs exhibited a conical needle shape with sufficient mechanical strength to penetrate the stratum corneum up to approximately 467.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a065.12\u00a0\u03bcm. The system provided a high skin permeation rate of 41.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.26\u00a0% and significant drug accumulation in the skin. Additionally, the formulation was proven safe in cell culture while effectively inhibiting cancer growth and promoting apoptosis. This study highlights the potential of AI-enhanced cHMNs for delivering 5-FU-HP\u03b2CD-loaded FP-LPs transdermally, offering a promising new treatment avenue for non-melanoma skin cancers.",

    "abstract": "The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within pathology and healthcare has advanced extensively. We have accordingly witnessed increased adoption of various AI tools which are transforming our approach to clinical decision support, personalized medicine, predictive analytics, automation, and discovery. The familiar and more reliable AI tools that have been incorporated within healthcare thus far fall mostly under the non-generative AI domain, which includes supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques. This review article explores how such non-generative AI methods, rooted in traditional rules-based systems, enhance diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and consistency within medicine. Key concepts and the application of supervised learning models (i.e. classification and regression) such as decision trees, support vector machines, linear and logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, and neural networks are explained along with the newer landscape of neural network-based non-generative foundation models. Unsupervised learning techniques including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection are also discussed for their role in uncovering novel disease subtypes or identifying outliers. Technical details related to the application of non-generative AI algorithms for analyzing whole slide images is also highlighted. The performance, explainability and reliability of non-generative AI models essential for clinical decision-making is also reviewed, as well as challenges related to data quality, model interpretability, and risk of data drift. An understanding of which AI-ML models to employ and which shortcomings need to be addressed is imperative to safely and efficiently leverage, integrate, and monitor these traditional AI tools in clinical practice and research.",

    "abstract": "Medical research within areas of deep learning, particularly in computer vision for medical imaging, has shown promise over the past decade with an increasing volume of technical papers published in orthopaedics related to imaging artificial intelligence (AI). However, as more tools and models are developed and deployed, it is easy for clinicians to get overwhelmed with the different types of models, leaving \"artificial intelligence\" as an empty buzzword where true value can be unclear. As with surgery, the techniques of deep learning require thoughtful application and cannot follow a one-size-fits-all approach as different problems require differential levels of technical complexity with model application. Moreover, the application of AI-based clinical tools should be both adjunctive and transparent in their stepwise integration within clinical medicine to provide additive insight. As a medical profession, we must together decide how, when, and where we want AI-based applications to offer insight.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exhibits an exceptional intratumoral heterogeneity that might influence diagnosis and outcome. Advances in digital microscopy and artificial intelligence (AI) may improve the HCC identification of liver cancer cells.\nTwo AI algorithms were designed to perform computer-assisted discrimination of tumour from non-tumour nuclei in HCC.\nHealthy livers and HCCs from commercially available tissue arrays were stained with an antibody against proliferating cell nuclear antigen and DRAQ5 dye with high affinity for double-stranded DNA, acquired by confocal microscopy imaging and then used to design machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms.\nNuclei were segmented and then used to develop the Model 1 and Model 2 algorithms, using ML and DL respectively. Model 1 was trained with some texture nuclear features extracted using discrete wavelet transform and grey-level co-occurrence matrix. Model 2 was trained with the segmented images without any additional information. The comparative analysis of the models showed that DL was more effective than ML, achieving an average accuracy of 88 % in discriminating healthy from neoplastic nuclei in HCC samples.\nOur research shows that AI techniques and nuclear fluorescent staining could be useful tools for automatically detecting HCC cells in liver tissues.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient deficiencies during pregnancy may affect offspring development. We aim to examine the association between prenatal vitamin B12 intake and children's cognitive development.\nA total of 5151 mother-child pairs from the Czech part of ELSPAC study were included in the analysis. Dietary information was obtained during pregnancy using food frequency questionnaire. Parents reported on their child's speech and language development at 18\u00a0months, 3, 5 and 7\u00a0years. Intelligence quotient (IQ) was measured at 8\u00a0years in subcohort of 854 children.\nChildren of mothers with higher vitamin B12 intake demonstrated higher scores in language (B\u00a0=\u00a00.20, 95% CI 0.06, 0.34) and talking and understanding (B\u00a0=\u00a02.39, 95% CI 0.97, 3.80) in a fully adjusted model at 18\u00a0months. Additionally, they were more likely to get maximum points in the intelligibility test at age 3 (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.05, 95% CI 1.01, 1.09) in unadjusted model, however, not in fully adjusted model. We found a positive effect of higher vitamin B12 intake on verbal IQ (B\u00a0=\u00a01.08, 95% CI 0.09, 2.08).\nWe identified consistent associations between prenatal vitamin B12 intake and children's cognitive development.

    "abstract": "Global migration necessitates adeptness in intercultural situations and high cultural awareness, crucial for nurses. Ensuring safe healthcare for migrants in diverse settings is imperative. Cultivating cultural intelligence should start at the undergraduate level, facilitated by diverse educational approaches.\nThe aim was to analyse the correlation between participation in formal and informal education and the level of cultural intelligence in a group of undergraduate nursing students.\nResearchers conducted a nationwide cross-sectional multicentre online survey study.\nWe invited nursing students from all Polish medical universities offering undergraduate nursing studies to participate in the study.\nThe study sample consisted of 1373 undergraduate nursing students from 39 Polish nursing schools: 54.0\u00a0% - first year, 28.7\u00a0% - second year, 17.3\u00a0% - third year.\nWe used a Polish version of the Cultural Intelligence Scale. The questionnaire gathered demographic information and explored cultural experiences in both formal and informal education settings. We examined the influence of various forms of formal and informal education on the level of cultural intelligence using independent t-tests and one-way ANOVA. We measured effect sizes using Cohen's d for t-tests and eta squared (\u03b7\nThe level of cultural intelligence of the students was a STEN score of five (M\u00a0=\u00a082.8 points). The largest effect related to the increase in cultural intelligence was observed for the survey item on interactions with culturally diverse people (Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a0-0.62), and the smallest effect was observed for the survey item on multiculturalism-related content delivered during the course of study (\u03b72\u00a0=\u00a00.012). The analyses showed a significant correlation between formal education and cultural intelligence, especially for the combination of formal and informal education.\nThe combination of formal and informal education and rich intercultural experiences are crucial for the successful development of cultural intelligence among nursing students in Poland.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized numerous industries, enhancing efficiency, scalability, and insight generation. In cardiology, particularly through electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, AI has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the time needed for diagnosis. This systematic review explores the integration of AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) in ECG analysis, focusing on their impact on predictive diagnostics and treatment support in cardiology.\nA systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 framework, using four high-impact databases to identify studies from 2014 to -2024. The inclusion criteria included English-language journal articles and research papers that focused on AI applications in cardiology, specifically ECG analysis. Records were screened, duplicates were removed, and final selections were made on the basis of their relevance to AI-ECG integration for cardiac health.\nThe review included 46 studies that met the inclusion criteria, covering diverse AI models such as CNNs, RNNs, and hybrid models. These models were applied to ECG data to detect and predict heart conditions such as arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. These findings indicate that AI-driven ECG analysis improves diagnostic accuracy and provides significant support for early diagnosis and personalized treatment.\nAI technologies, especially ML and DL, enhance ECG-based cardiology diagnostics by increasing accuracy, reducing diagnosis time, and supporting timely interventions and personalized care. Continued research in this area is essential to refine algorithms and integrate AI tools into clinical practice for improved patient outcomes in cardiology.",

    "abstract": "Drug design has always been pursuing techniques with time- and cost-benefits. Virtual screening, generally classified as ligand-based (LBVS) and structure-based (SBVS) approaches, could identify active compounds in the large chemical library to reduce time and cost. Owing to the intrinsic flaws and complementary nature of both approaches, continued efforts have been made to combine them to mitigate limitations. Meanwhile, the emergence of machine learning (ML) endows them with opportunities to leverage vast amounts of data to improve their defects. However, few discussions on how to merge ML-improved LBVS and SBVS have been conducted. Therefore, this review provides insights into combined usage of ML-improved LBVS and SBVS to enlighten medicinal chemists to utilize these joint strategies to lift the screening efficiency as well as AI professionals to design novel techniques.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid nodules are common in the general population, and assessing their malignancy risk is the initial step in care. Surgical exploration remains the sole definitive option for indeterminate nodules. Extensive database access is crucial for improving this initial assessment. Our objective was to develop an automated process using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract and structure biomedical insights from electronic health reports (EHRs) in a large thyroid pathology cohort.\nWe randomly selected 1,500 patients with thyroid pathology from our cohort for model development and an additional 100 for testing. We then divided the cohort of 1,500 patients into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets. We used EHRs from initial surgeon visits, preanesthesia visits, ultrasound, surgery, and anatomopathology reports. We selected 42 variables of interest and had them manually annotated by a clinical expert. We developed RUBY-THYRO using six distinct CNN models from SpaCy, supplemented with keyword extraction rules and postprocessing. Evaluation against a gold standard database included calculating precision, recall, and F1 score.\nPerformance remained consistent across the test and validation sets, with the majority of variables (30/42) achieving performance metrics exceeding 90% for all metrics in both sets. Results differed according to the variables; pathologic tumor stage score achieved 100% in precision, recall, and F1 score, versus 45%, 28%, and 32% for the number of nodules in the test set, respectively. Surgical and preanesthesia reports demonstrated particularly high performance.\nOur study successfully implemented a CNN-based natural language processing (NLP) approach for extracting and structuring data from various EHRs in thyroid pathology. This highlights the potential of artificial intelligence-driven NLP techniques for extensive and cost-effective data extraction, paving the way for creating comprehensive, hospital-wide data warehouses.",

    "abstract": "Repeatedly undergoing supervised, medical, detoxification from chronic alcohol use may contribute to impairments in neurocognitive functioning of patients with an alcohol use disorder (AUD). Unsupervised, non-medical, detoxification, however, may also contribute to neurocognitive impairments, given the absence of first choice prescription medication to counteract severe withdrawal effects. So far, findings from previous studies are inconclusive and specifically effects of non-medical detoxifications are not investigated yet. Using an association modeling approach, this study investigates whether intelligence, speed, attention, and executive functioning are influenced by previous medical and/or non-medical detoxifications.\nA total of 106 participants with AUD underwent a clinical medical supervised detoxification. Basic characteristics of the patient were recorded including the number of previous medical and non-medical detoxifications. Neuropsychological assessment was conducted after 6\u00a0weeks of abstinence.\nThe amount of previous medical detoxifications (F (1, 87)\u2009=\u20094.108, P\u2009=\u2009.046) and the group of medical detoxifications (F(1, 87)\u2009=\u20094734, P\u2009=\u2009.032), predicted performance on one out of 14 dependent variables, i.e. the \"d2 Number of Signs\" task. Though \"Age of onset of daily alcohol use\" contributed significantly to this relationship, the change of the regression coefficient of the model was \u02c210%. The number of non-medical or total amount of previous detoxifications did not predict any of the dependent variables.\nThe results indicate limited evidence of a linear association between either medical, non-medical, or total amount of previous detoxifications and measures of intelligence, speed, attention, or executive functioning, while controlling for relevant confounders.",

    "abstract": "Objective Founded in 1873, the Institut universitaire en sant\u00e9 mentale de Montr\u00e9al (IUSMM) has a captivating history that significantly reflects the evolution of psychiatry over the years. In recent years, the primary sectors of modern medicine have turned to digital health innovations to enhance patient care development. The main objective of this review is to document advancements in digital health within the IUSMM and its affiliated research center over the past 150 years. Method An integrative review focusing on digital health innovations at the IUSMM was conducted. The Medline, Web of Science, PsycNet (PsycINFO), and Google Scholar databases were consulted from their inception until December 2023. Result The literature review initially identified 239 articles, with 108 duplicates removed during the preliminary analysis. Among the remaining 131 studies, 63 articles were excluded based on title and abstract review, as they did not meet inclusion criteria. After a comprehensive analysis of the initially selected 68 articles for eligibility evaluation, a total of 22 articles were retained. Five categories of articles were identified: virtual reality, digital applications, remote services and therapies, the use of artificial intelligence, and digital personal assistants. Conclusion On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the IUSMM, this integrative review reveals that digital health innovations are primarily concentrated in the last decade, suggesting promising potential for digital applications in supporting individuals with mental health disorders, although the transition to clinical practice may progress slowly.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has shown potential for various applications in the medical field, particularly for diagnosing and managing chronic diseases among children and adolescents. This systematic review aims to comprehensively analyze and synthesize research on the use of AI for monitoring, guiding, and assisting pediatric patients with chronic diseases. Five major electronic databases were searched (Medline, Scopus, PsycINFO, ACM, Web of Science), along with manual searches of gray literature, personal archives, and reference lists of relevant papers. All original studies as well as conference abstracts and proceedings, focusing on AI applications for pediatric chronic disease care were included. Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. We extracted AI method used, study design, population, intervention, and main results. Two researchers independently extracted data and resolved discrepancies through discussion. AI applications are diverse, encompassing, e.g., disease classification, outcome prediction, or decision support. AI generally performed well, though most models were tested on retrospective data. AI-based tools have shown promise in mental health analysis, e.g., by using speech sampling or social media data to predict therapy outcomes for various chronic conditions.\nWhile AI holds potential in pediatric chronic disease care, most reviewed studies are small-scale research projects. Prospective clinical implementations are needed to validate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Ethical considerations, cultural influences, and stakeholder attitudes should be integrated into future research.\n\u2022\u00a0Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play a more dominant role in medicine and healthcare in the future and many\u00a0applications are already being developed.\n\u2022\u00a0Our review provides an overview on how AI-driven systems might be able to support children and adolescents with\u00a0chronic illnesses. \u2022\u00a0While many applications are being researched, few have been tested on real-world, prospective, clinical data.",

This narrative review aims at providing an up-to-date discussion about the state of the art of applications of artificial intelligence in emergency neuroradiology, which have substantially expanded in depth and scope in the past few years. A detailed analysis of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in several tasks related to acute ischemic stroke involving various imaging modalities, including a description of existing commercial products, is provided. The applications of artificial intelligence in acute intracranial hemorrhage and other vascular pathologies such as intracranial aneurysm and arteriovenous malformation are discussed. Other areas of emergency neuroradiology including infection, fracture, cord compression, and pediatric imaging are further discussed in turn. Based on these discussions, this article offers insight into practical considerations regarding the applications of artificial intelligence in emergency neuroradiology, calling for more development driven by clinical needs, attention to pediatric neuroimaging, and analysis of real-world performance.",

    "abstract": "Radiologists increasingly use artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize workflows. However, many lack the technical skills to effectively apply machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, limiting the accessibility of these methods to radiology researchers who could otherwise benefit from them. Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o, may serve as virtual advisors, offering tailored algorithm recommendations for specific research needs. This study evaluates GPT-4o's effectiveness as a recommender system to enhance radiologists' understanding and implementation of AI in research.\nGPT-4o was used to recommend ML and DL algorithms based on specific details provided by researchers, including dataset characteristics, modality types, data sizes, and research objectives. The model acted as a virtual advisor, guiding researchers in selecting the most appropriate models for their studies.\nThe study systematically evaluated GPT-4o's recommendations for clarity, task alignment, model diversity, and baseline selection. Responses were graded to assess the model's ability to meet the needs of radiology researchers.\nGPT-4o effectively recommended appropriate ML and DL algorithms for various radiology tasks, including segmentation, classification, and regression in medical imaging. The model suggested a diverse range of established and innovative algorithms, such as U-Net, Random Forest, Attention U-Net, and EfficientNet, aligning well with accepted practices.\nGPT-4o shows promise as a valuable tool for radiologists and early career researchers by providing clear and relevant AI and ML algorithm recommendations. Its ability to bridge the knowledge gap in AI implementation could democratize access to advanced technologies, fostering innovation and improving radiology research quality. Further studies should explore integrating LLMs into routine workflows and their role in ongoing professional development.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined as the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally associated with human intelligence. At present, AI has been widely used in a variety of ultrasound tasks, including in point-of-care ultrasound, echocardiography, and various diseases of different organs. However, the characteristics of ultrasound, compared to other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), poses significant additional challenges to AI. Application of AI can not only reduce variability during ultrasound image acquisition, but can standardize these interpretations and identify patterns that escape the human eye and brain. These advances have enabled greater innovations in ultrasound AI applications that can be applied to a variety of clinical settings and disease states. Therefore, The World Federation of Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (WFUMB) is addressing the topic with a brief and practical overview of current and potential future AI applications in medical ultrasound, as well as discuss some current limitations and future challenges to AI implementation.",

    "abstract": "Due to the breakthrough in protein structure prediction by AlphaFold, the scientific community has access to 200 million predicted protein structures with near-atomic accuracy from the AlphaFold protein structure DataBase (AFDB), covering nearly the entire protein universe. Segmenting these models into domains and classifying them into an evolutionary hierarchy hold tremendous potential for unraveling essential insights into protein function.\nWe introduce DPAM-AI, a Domain Parser for AlphaFold Models based on Artificial Intelligence. DPAM-AI utilizes a convolutional neural network trained with previously classified domains in the Evolutionary Classification Of protein Domains (ECOD) database. DPAM-AI integrates inter-residue distances, predicted aligned errors, and sequence and structural alignments to previously classified domains detected via sequence (HHsuite) and structural (Dali) similarity searches. DPAM-AI has demonstrated its power through rigorous tests, excelling in several benchmark sets compared to its predecessor, DPAM, and other recently published domain parsers, Merizo and Chainsaw. We applied DPAM-AI to representative AFDB models for proteins classified in Pfam. We obtained representative 3D structures for 18\u00a0487 (89%) of the 20\u00a0795 Pfam families. The remaining families either (i) belong to viral proteins that were excluded from AFDB or (ii) do not adopt globular 3D structures. Our structure-aware domain delineation uncovered a considerable fraction (15%) of Pfam domains containing multiple structural and evolutionary units and refined the boundaries for over half.\nPfam and corresponding DPAM-AI domains are at http://prodata.swmed.edu/DPAM-pfam/. Our code is deposited at https://github.com/Jsauce5p/DPAM/tree/dpam_ai, and updates will be released through https://github.com/CongLabCode/DPAM.",

    "abstract": "In sepsis treatment, achieving and maintaining effective antibiotic therapy is crucial. However, optimal antibiotic dosing faces challenges due to significant variability among patients with sepsis. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), the current gold standard, lacks initial dosage adjustments and global availability. Even with daily TDM, antibiotic serum concentrations (ASCs) often deviate from the therapeutic range. This study addresses these challenges by developing machine learning (ML)-based ASC prediction models capable of handling variable data input and encompassing diverse clinical, laboratory, microbiological and proteomic parameters without the need for daily TDM.\nThis prospective observational study is conducted in a German university hospital intensive care unit. Eligible sepsis patients receive continuous antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (n=100) or meropenem (n=100) within 24 hours. Exclusion criteria include refusal, pregnancy, lactation and severe anaemia (haemoglobin <8\u2009g/dL). Blood samples for TDM are collected from patients, along with clinical and laboratory parameters on days 1-8 and day 30 or on discharge. ML models predicting ASC between day 1 and day 8 serve as primary and key secondary endpoints. We will use the collected data to develop multifaceted ML-based algorithms aimed at optimising antibiotic dosing in sepsis. Our two-way approach involves creating two distinct algorithms: the first focuses on predictive accuracy and generalisability using routine clinical parameters, while the second leverages an extended dataset including a plethora of factors currently insufficiently explored and not available in standard clinical practice but may help to enhance precision. Ultimately, these models are envisioned for integration into clinical decision support systems within patient data management systems, facilitating automated, personalised treatment recommendations for sepsis.\nThe study received approval from the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of Ruhr-University Bochum (No. 23-7905). Findings will be disseminated through open-access publication in a peer-reviewed journal and social media channels.\nDRKS00032970.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to compare artificial intelligence (AI)-based coronary stenosis evaluation of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with its quantitative counterpart of invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR). This single-center retrospective study included 195 symptomatic patients (mean age 61 \u00b1 10 years, 149 men, 585 coronary arteries) with 215 intermediate coronary lesions, with quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) diameter stenosis ranging from 20% to 80%. An AI-driven research prototype (AI-CCTA) was used to quantify stenosis on CCTA images. The diagnostic accuracy of AI-CCTA was assessed on a per-vessel basis using ICA stenosis grading (with \u226550% stenosis) or invasive FFR (\u22640.80) as reference standards. AI-driven diameter stenosis was correlated with the QCA results and expert manual measurements subsequently. The disease prevalence in the 585 coronary arteries, as determined by invasive angiography (\u226550%), was 46.5%. AI-CCTA exhibited sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the curve (AUC) of 71.7%, 89.8%, 85.9%, 78.5%, and 0.81, respectively. The diagnostic performance of AI-CCTA was moderate for the 215 intermediate lesions assessed using QCA and FFR, with an AUC of 0.63 for QCA and FFR. AI-CCTA demonstrated a moderate correlation with QCA (r\u202f=\u202f0.42, p <0.001) for measuring the degree of stenosis, which was notably better than the results from manual quantification versus QCA (r\u202f=\u202f0.26, p\u202f=\u202f0.001). In conclusion, AI-driven CCTA analysis exhibited promising results. AI-CCTA demonstrated a moderate relation with QCA in intermediate coronary stenosis lesions; however, its results surpassed those of manual evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Cells are essential to understanding health and disease, yet traditional models fall short of modeling and simulating their function and behavior. Advances in AI and omics offer groundbreaking opportunities to create an AI virtual cell (AIVC), a multi-scale, multi-modal large-neural-network-based model that can represent and simulate the behavior of molecules, cells, and tissues across diverse states. This Perspective provides a vision on their design and how collaborative efforts to build AIVCs will transform biological research by allowing high-fidelity simulations, accelerating discoveries, and guiding experimental studies, offering new opportunities for understanding cellular functions and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations in open science.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory medicine provides pivotal medical information through analyses of body fluids and tissues, and thus, it is essential for diagnosis of diseases as well as monitoring of disease progression. Despite its universal importance, the field is currently suffering from the limited workforce and analytical capabilities due to the increasing pressure from expanding global population and unexpected rise of noncommunicable diseases. The emerging technologies of microfluidic automation and artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the development of advanced diagnostic platforms, positioning themselves as adaptable solutions to enable highly efficient and accessible laboratory medicine. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive review of microfluidic automation, focusing on the microstructure design and automation principles, along with its intended functionalities for diagnostic purposes. Subsequently, we exemplify the integration of AI with microfluidics and illustrating how their combination benefits for the applications and what the challenges are in this rapidly evolving field. Finally, the review offers a balanced perspective on the microfluidics and AI, discussing their promising role in advancing laboratory medicine.",

    "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a prevalent anxiety disorder marked by strong fear and avoidance of social scenarios. Early detection of SAD lays the foundation for the introduction of early interventions. However, due to the nature of social avoidance in social anxiety, the screening is challenging in the clinical setting. Classic questionnaires also bear the limitations of subjectivity, memory biases under repeated measures, and cultural influence. Thus, there exists an urgent need to develop a reliable and easily accessible tool to be widely used for social anxiety screening. Here, we developed the Social Artificial Intelligence Picture System (SAIPS) based on generative multi-modal foundation artificial intelligence (AI) models, containing a total of 279 social pictures and 118 control pictures. Social scenarios were constructed to represent core SAD triggers such as fear of negative evaluation, social interactions, and performance anxiety, mapping to specific dimensions of social anxiety to capture its multifaceted nature. Pictures devoid of social interactions were included as a control, aiming to reveal response patterns specific to social scenarios and to improve the system's precision in predicting social anxiety traits. Through laboratory and online experiments, we collected ratings on SAIPS from five dimensions. Machine learning results showed that ratings on SAIPS robustly reflected and predicted an individual's trait of social anxiety, especially social anxiety and arousal ratings. The prediction was reliable, even based on a short version with less than 30 pictures. Together, SAIPS may serve as a promising tool to support social anxiety screening and longitudinal predictions.",

    "abstract": "The following document details low-cost hardware and open-source available software tools that can be combined to support active teaching methodologies like Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and incorporate work-oriented technological skills in students. This proposal presents a prototype of Open Educational Resources (OER) that integrates software and hardware tools for the specific purpose of facilitating instruction in Artificial Intelligence. The hardware consists of affordable electronic devices, including an Arduino board, servo motors, sensors, a relay and a motor, all integrated into a scaled conveyor belt. On the other hand, open software was used to implement an image classification program with different features (shape, color, size, among others). The exact construction steps, circuits, and code are presented in detail and should encourage other scientists to replicate the experimental setup, especially if they are looking for experimental teaching of artificial intelligence, since the system allows object classification using the machine learning paradigm to facilitate the teaching of artificial intelligence concepts with computer vision concepts.",
