    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played a substantial role in the response to the challenges posed by the current pandemic. The growing interest in using AI to handle Covid-19 issues has accelerated the pace of AI research and resulted in an exponential increase in articles and review studies within a very short period of time. Hence, it is becoming challenging to explore the large corpus of academic publications dedicated to the global health crisis. Even with the presence of systematic review studies, given their number and diversity, identifying trends and research avenues beyond the pandemic should be an arduous task. We conclude therefore that after the one-year mark of the declaration of Covid-19 as a pandemic, the accumulated scientific contribution lacks two fundamental aspects: Knowledge synthesis and Future projections. In contribution to fill this void, this paper is a (i) synthesis study and (ii) foresight exercise. The synthesis study aims to provide the scholars a consolidation of findings and a knowledge synthesis through a systematic review of the reviews (umbrella review) studying AI applications against Covid-19. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and other preprint sources from 1st December 2019 to 1st June 2021 for eligible reviews. The literature search and screening process resulted in 45 included reviews. Our findings reveal patterns, relationships, and trends in the AI research community response to the pandemic. We found that in the space of few months, the research objectives of the literature have developed rapidly from identifying potential AI applications to evaluating current uses of intelligent systems. Only few reviews have adopted the ",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) is defined by the ability to perceive, manage, and reason about emotions in oneself and others. Studies have reported deficits in EI abilities among certain antisocial populations such as individuals with psychopathy, and enhanced performance among sexual offenders. Despite EI's relevance to offending behaviour, the association between EI and paraphilic offending has been under-studied. We examined the association between EI, sexual offending, and sexual sadism in 80 incarcerated men with sexual offenses and 207 incarcerated men with non-sexual offences. EI was assessed using the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). Sadism was measured using the Severe Sexual Sadism Scale (SeSaS). Results showed that SeSaS scores were positively associated with Strategic EI (the ability to understand and manage emotions), but were not significantly related to Experiential EI. This may reflect core characteristics of sexual sadism including domination and manipulation, challenging the prevalent notion that higher EI is invariably positive.",

    "abstract": "We present interesting application of artificial intelligence for investigating effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on 3-dimensional temperature variation across Nigeria (2\u00b0-15\u00b0 E, 4\u00b0-14\u00b0 N), in equatorial Africa. Artificial neural networks were trained to learn time-series temperature variation patterns using radio occultation measurements of atmospheric temperature from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC). Data used for training, validation and testing of the neural networks covered period prior to the lockdown. There was also an investigation into the viability of solar activity indicator (represented by the sunspot number) as an input for the process. The results indicated that including the sunspot number as an input for the training did not improve the network prediction accuracy. The trained network was then used to predict values for the lockdown period. Since the network was trained using pre-lockdown dataset, predictions from the network are regarded as expected temperatures, should there have been no lockdown. By comparing with the actual COSMIC measurements during the lockdown period, effects of the lockdown on atmospheric temperatures were deduced. In overall, the mean altitudinal temperatures rose by about 1.1\u00a0\u00b0C above expected values during the lockdown. An altitudinal breakdown, at 1\u00a0km resolution, reveals that the values were typically below 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C at most of the altitudes, but exceeded 1\u00a0\u00b0C at 28 and 29\u00a0km altitudes. The temperatures were also observed to drop below expected values at altitudes of 0-2\u00a0km, and 17-20\u00a0km.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify factors associated with diabetes management self-efficacy in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in Korea.\nA total of 173 pregnant women with GDM in Korea were recruited by posting announcements at two Korean online communities focusing on pregnancy and GDM. Participants completed a structured online survey from July to September 2018. Thirteen inappropriate responses were excluded and a total of 160 questionnaires were used in the final analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated and multiple regression with the enter method was done to identify the associations of depressive mood, anxiety, emotional intelligence, and sleep quality with diabetes management self-efficacy.\nRespondents reported a moderately depressive mood (mean, 10.36), low to moderate anxiety (mean, 41.65), above-average emotional intelligence (mean, 78.04), moderate sleep quality (mean, 42.01), and above-average diabetes management self-efficacy (mean, 52.29). The major factor associated with diabetes management self-efficacy of pregnant women with GDM was emotional intelligence (\u03b2=.51, \nThe results of this study suggest that to improve the diabetes management self-efficacy of pregnant women with GDM, it is necessary to develop an education program that can also enhance emotional intelligence, sleep quality, and exercise.",

    "abstract": "To construct a standard dataset of contrast-enhanced CT images of liver tumors to test the performance and safety of artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms for clinical decision support systems (CDSSs).\nA consensus group of medical experts in gastrointestinal radiology from four national tertiary institutions discussed the conditions to be included in a standard dataset. Seventy-five cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 75 cases of metastasis, and 30-50 cases of benign lesions were retrieved from each institution, and the final dataset consisted of 300 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 300 cases of metastasis, and 183 cases of benign lesions. Only pathologically confirmed cases of hepatocellular carcinomas and metastases were enrolled. The medical experts retrieved the medical records of the patients and manually labeled the CT images. The CT images were saved as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files.\nThe medical experts in gastrointestinal radiology constructed the standard dataset of contrast-enhanced CT images for 783 cases of liver tumors. The performance and safety of the AI algorithm can be evaluated by calculating the sensitivity and specificity for detecting and characterizing the lesions.\nThe constructed standard dataset can be utilized for evaluating the machine-learningbased AI algorithm for CDSS.\n\uac04 \uc885\uc591\uc758 \uc870\uc601\uc99d\uac15 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130\ub2e8\uce35\ucd2c\uc601(\uc774\ud558 CT) \uc601\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud305 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.\n\uad6d\ub0b4 4\uac1c 3\ucc28 \uc758\ub8cc\uae30\uad00\uc758 \ubcf5\ubd80 \uc601\uc0c1\uc758\ud559 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 4\uc778\uc774 \ubaa8\uc5ec \uac04 \uc885\uc591 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud45c\uc900 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc774 \uac16\ucdb0\uc57c \ud560 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uac01 \uae30\uad00\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uac04\uc138\ud3ec\uc554 75\uc608, \uc804\uc774\uc554 75\uc608, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc591\uc131 \ubcd1\ubcc0 30\u201350\uc608\uc529 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc5ec, \ucd1d 783\uba85 \ud658\uc790\uc758 CT \uc601\uc0c1\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uac04\uc138\ud3ec\uc554\uacfc \uc804\uc774\uc554\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubcd1\ub9ac\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc9c4\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0\ub9cc\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uac01 \uae30\uad00\uc758 \ubcf5\ubd80 \uc601\uc0c1\uc758\ud559 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc774 \uc9c1\uc811 \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1\uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 CT \uc601\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1(labeling)\uc744 \uc218\uae30\ub85c \uc2dc\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

    "abstract": "In plastic surgery and cosmetic dermatology, photographic data are an invaluable element of research and clinical practice. Additionally, the use of before and after images is a standard documentation method for procedures, and these images are particularly useful in consultations for effective communication with the patient. An artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach has been proven to have significant results in medical dermatology, plastic surgery, and antiaging procedures in recent years, with applications ranging from skin cancer screening to 3D face reconstructions, the prediction of biological age and perceived age. The increasing use of AI and computer vision methods is due to their noninvasive nature and their potential to provide remote diagnostics. This is especially helpful in instances where traveling to a physical office is complicated, as we have experienced in recent years with the global coronavirus pandemic. However, one question remains: how should the results of AI-based analysis be presented to enable personalization? In this paper, the author investigates the benefit of using gender- and age-specific scales to present skin parameter scores calculated using AI-based systems when analyzing image data.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the performance of tasks by machines ordinarily associated with human intelligence. Machine learning (ML) is a subtype of AI; it refers to the ability of computers to draw conclusions (ie, learn) from data without being directly programmed. ML builds from traditional statistical methods and has drawn significant interest in healthcare epidemiology due to its potential for improving disease prediction and patient care. This review provides an overview of ML in healthcare epidemiology and practical examples of ML tools used to support healthcare decision making at 4\u00a0stages of hospital-based care: triage, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge. Examples include model-building efforts to assist emergency department triage, predicting time before septic shock onset, detecting community-acquired pneumonia, and classifying COVID-19 disposition risk level. Increasing availability and quality of electronic health record (EHR) data as well as computing power provides opportunities for ML to increase patient safety, improve the efficiency of clinical management, and reduce healthcare costs.",

    "abstract": "Capsule endoscopy has revolutionized the management of patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Nevertheless, reading capsule endoscopy images is time-consuming and prone to overlooking significant lesions, thus limiting its diagnostic yield. We aimed to create a deep learning algorithm for automatic detection of blood and hematic residues in the enteric lumen in capsule endoscopy exams.\nA convolutional neural network was developed based on a total pool of 22,095 capsule endoscopy images (13,510 images containing luminal blood and 8,585 of normal mucosa or other findings). A training dataset comprising 80% of the total pool of images was defined. The performance of the network was compared to a consensus classification provided by 2 specialists in capsule endoscopy. Subsequently, we evaluated the performance of the network using an independent validation dataset (20% of total image pool), calculating its sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision.\nOur convolutional neural network detected blood and hematic residues in the small bowel lumen with an accuracy and precision of 98.5 and 98.7%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 98.6 and 98.9%, respectively. The analysis of the testing dataset was completed in 24 s (approximately 184 frames/s).\nWe have developed an artificial intelligence tool capable of effectively detecting luminal blood. The development of these tools may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of capsule endoscopy when evaluating patients presenting with obscure small bowel bleeding.\nA endoscopia por c\u00e1psula revolucionou a abordagem a doentes com hemorragia digestiva obscura.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has great potential to transform the clinical workflow of radiotherapy. Since the introduction of deep neural networks, many AI-based methods have been proposed to address challenges in different aspects of radiotherapy. Commercial vendors have started to release AI-based tools that can be readily integrated to the established clinical workflow. To show the recent progress in AI-aided radiotherapy, we have reviewed AI-based studies in five major aspects of radiotherapy including image reconstruction, image registration, image segmentation, image synthesis, and automatic treatment planning. In each section, we summarized and categorized the recently published methods, followed by a discussion of the challenges, concerns, and future development. Given the rapid development of AI-aided radiotherapy, the efficiency and effectiveness of radiotherapy in the future could be substantially improved through intelligent automation of various aspects of radiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Law enforcement agencies in the UK are embracing evidence-based policing and recognise the importance of human source intelligence (HUMINT) in the decision-making process. A review of the literature identified six categories likely to impact the handling of a covert human intelligence source (CHIS) or an informant: (a) handler personality traits; (b) informant motivation; (c) rapport; (d) gaining cooperation; (e) obtaining information, and (f) detecting deception. This study sought to identify which of these categories current HUMINT practitioners considered the most when planning and conducting a meeting with an informant. A bespoke online survey was designed and disseminated to 34 practitioners using purposive and snowball sampling. Directed content analysis and thematic content analysis were conducted. Results indicate that practitioners appear most concerned with gaining co-operation (d) and detecting deception (f). Results also found an inter-connectivity between the six categories, with informant handlers often having to balance competing requirements. Implications for future research are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The rise in artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques has increased considerably in the last few decades. Historically, the focus has been primarily on texts expressed in prose form, leaving mostly aside figurative or poetic expressions of language due to their rich semantics and syntactic complexity. The creation and analysis of poetry have been commonly carried out by hand, with a few computer-assisted approaches. In the Spanish context, the promise of machine learning is starting to pan out in specific tasks such as metrical annotation and syllabification. However, there is a task that remains unexplored and underdeveloped: stanza classification. This classification of the inner structures of verses in which a poem is built upon is an especially relevant task for poetry studies since it complements the structural information of a poem. In this work, we analyzed different computational approaches to stanza classification in the Spanish poetic tradition. These approaches show that this task continues to be hard for computers systems, both based on classical machine learning approaches as well as statistical language models and cannot compete with traditional computational paradigms based on the knowledge of experts.",

    "abstract": "The involvement of artificial intelligence in biomedicine promises better support for decision-making both in conventional and research medical practice. Yet two important issues emerge in relation to personal data handling, and the influence of AI on patient/doctor relationships. The development of AI algorithms presupposes extensive processing of big data in biobanks, for which procedures of compliance with data protection need to be ensured. This article addresses this problem in the framework of the EU legislation (GDPR) and explains the legal prerequisites pertinent to various categories of health data. Furthermore, the self-learning systems of AI may affect the fulfillment of medical duties, particularly if the attending physicians rely on unsupervised applications operating beyond their direct control. The article argues that the patient informed consent prerequisite plays a key role here, not only in conventional medical acts but also in clinical research procedures.",

    "abstract": "Regulators and payers play a pivotal role in facilitating timely and affordable access to safe and efficacious medicines. They use evidence generated from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) to support decisions to register and subsidise medicines. However, at the time of registration and subsidy approval, regulators and payers face uncertainty about how RCT outcomes will translate to real-world clinical practice. In response to this situation, medicines policy agencies worldwide have endorsed the use of real-world data (RWD) to derive novel insights on the use and outcomes of prescribed medicines. Recent reforms around data availability and use in Australia are creating unparalleled data access and opportunities for Australian researchers to undertake large-scale research to generate evidence on the safety and effectiveness of medicines in the real world. Highlighting the critical importance of research in this area, Quality Use of Medicines and Medicine Safety was announced as Australia's 10th National Health Priority in 2019. The National Health and Medical Research Council, Medicines Intelligence Centre of Research Excellence (MI-CRE) has been formed to take advantage of the renewed focus on quality use of medicines and the changing data landscape in Australia. It will generate timely research supporting the evidentiary needs of Australian medicines regulators and payers by accelerating the development and translation of real-world evidence on medicines use and outcomes. MI-CRE is developing a coordinated approach to identify, triage and respond to priority questions where there are significant uncertainties about medicines use, (cost)-effectiveness, and/or safety and creating a data ecosystem that will streamline access to Australian data to enable researchers to generate robust evidence in a timely manner. This paper outlines how MI-CRE will partner with policy makers, clinicians, and consumer advocates to leverage real-world data to co-create real-world evidence, to improve quality use of medicines and reduce medicine-related harm.",

    "abstract": "Anatomical segmentation has played a major role within clinical cardiology. Novel techniques through artificial intelligence-based computer vision have revolutionized this process through both automation and novel applications. This review discusses the history and clinical context of cardiac segmentation to provide a framework for a survey of recent manuscripts in artificial intelligence and cardiac segmentation. We aim to clarify for the reader the clinical question of \"Why do we segment?\" in order to understand the question of \"Where is current research and where should be?\".\nThere has been increasing research in cardiac segmentation in recent years. Segmentation models are most frequently based on a U-Net structure. Multiple innovations have been added in terms of pre-processing or connection to analysis pipelines. Cardiac MRI is the most frequently segmented modality, which is due in part to the presence of publically-available, moderately sized, computer vision competition datasets. Further progress in data availability, model explanation, and clinical integration are being pursued.\nThe task of cardiac anatomical segmentation has experienced massive strides forward within the past five years due to convolutional neural networks. These advances provide a basis for streamlining image analysis, and a foundation for further analysis both by computer and human systems. While technical advances are clear, clinical benefit remains nascent. Novel approaches may improve measurement precision by decreasing inter-reader variability and appear to also have the potential for larger-reaching effects in the future within integrated analysis pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Important adolescents' career-related decisions might be influenced by their beliefs about malleability of intelligence and learning (mindset). We combined quantitative and qualitative data to provide in-depth insights in the beliefs that 13-14-year-olds hold about learning and intelligence, the factors influencing these beliefs, and the consequences of these beliefs in relation to classroom behaviour and study choices. To establish students' mindsets quantitatively, we categorised theory of intelligence questionnaire (TOI; Dweck, 1999) averaged scores into three levels: entity, intermediate or incremental mindsets, to provide insight into the distribution of the different mindset types in our sample (N = 492). The results of this quantitative study show that more than half of the students believed intelligence is \"fixed\" (entity mindset), these data showed no effect of gender. To gain more in-depth insight in the views of these students, focus groups about mindset and its influences and consequences were held in a subsample (n = 176). The qualitative data provide more nuanced insights, for example they reveal subtle gender differences regarding effort beliefs and motivation. Integrated discussion of the quantitative and qualitative results demonstrates that this multi-method approach reflects the complexity of the concept mindset better than only the widely used TOI questionnaire.",

Although artificial intelligence (A.I.) tools have demonstrated Gleason grading on-par with expert pathologists, it remains an open question whether and to what extent A.I. grading translates to better prognostication.\nIn this study, we developed a system to predict prostate cancer-specific mortality via A.I.-based Gleason grading and subsequently evaluated its ability to risk-stratify patients on an independent retrospective cohort of 2807 prostatectomy cases from a single European center with 5-25 years of follow-up (median: 13, interquartile range 9-17).\nHere, we show that the A.I.'s risk scores produced a \nOur results suggest that A.I.-based Gleason grading can lead to effective risk stratification, and warrants further evaluation for improving disease management.",

    "abstract": "The advent of increasingly sophisticated medical technology, surgical interventions, and supportive healthcare measures is raising survival probabilities for babies born premature and/or with life-threatening health conditions. In the United States, this trend is associated with greater numbers of neonatal surgeries and higher admission rates into neonatal intensive care units (NICU) for newborns at all birth weights. Following surgery, current pain management in NICU relies primarily on narcotics (opioids) such as morphine and fentanyl (about 100 times more potent than morphine) that lead to a number of complications, including prolonged stays in NICU for opioid withdrawal. In this paper, we review current practices and challenges for pain assessment and treatment in NICU and outline ongoing efforts using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support pain- and opioid-sparing approaches for newborns in the future. A major focus for these next-generation approaches to NICU-based pain management is proactive pain mitigation (avoidance) aimed at preventing harm to neonates from ",

As of this writing, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved mammographic applications are available for triage, lesion detection and classification, and breast density assessment. For sonography and MRI, FDA-approved applications are available for lesion classification. Numerous other interpretive and noninterpretive AI applications are in the development phase. This article reviews AI applications for mammography, sonography, and MRI that are currently available for clinical use. In addition, clinical implementation and the future of AI for breast imaging are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous UAVs performing patrol tasks are a new type of border patrol method with high flexibility, high patrol efficiency, and low operating cost In order to improve the ability of heterogeneous UAVs to perform border patrol task, by constructing a three-dimensional complex coordinated planning model, a multi-objective fitness function with the minimum patrol energy consumption and maximum patrol coverage of UAVs in a complex mountain environment is established. Design an improved shuffled frog leaping algorithm (ISFLA) based on spiral search mechanism to solve the problem of task planning in complex mountain environment. The proposed algorithm is verified by simulation experiments. The simulation results show that the ISFLA algorithm for solving the path problem in complex three-dimensional environment has significantly improved the solving efficiency, accuracy and global convergence compared with the particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE) and shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA). The experiments show that the proposed algorithm also has excellent solving ability in solving complex planning problems.",

    "abstract": "Intelligence of physical agents, such as human-made (e.g., robots, autonomous cars) and biological (e.g., animals, plants) ones, is not only enabled by their computational intelligence (CI) in their brain, but also by their physical intelligence (PI) encoded in their body. Therefore, it is essential to advance the PI of human-made agents as much as possible, in addition to their CI, to operate them in unstructured and complex real-world environments like the biological agents. This article gives a perspective on what PI paradigm is, when PI can be more significant and dominant in physical and biological agents at different length scales and how bioinspired and abstract PI methods can be created in agent bodies. PI paradigm aims to synergize and merge many research fields, such as mechanics, materials science, robotics, mechanical design, fluidics, active matter, biology, self-assembly and collective systems, to enable advanced PI capabilities in human-made agent bodies, comparable to the ones observed in biological organisms. Such capabilities would progress the future robots and other machines beyond what can be realized using the current frameworks.",

    "abstract": "During the Disease outbreak and in the future, there will be a lot of learning. Since the pandemic has interrupted global schooling, remote learning has emerged as a viable option, depending on machine learning to accomplish its goals. Using the example of ten international science journals that speak out about artificial intelligence in education today and the future of earning, we hope to gain a better understanding of the large extend of the power of artificial intelligence in education, both during the COVID-19 period and during the future learning time frame. Additionally, in addition to evaluating 10 articles, we used an internet search engine to look for relevant material. We conducted searches using terms such as artificial intelligence, learning during a pandemic, and Machine learning, among other things. After that, we used a phenomenological technique to confirm that our results answered the research questions, which was done in accordance with a qualitative approach. Our findings can be summarized by taking into account the evidence from research and literature. Among our findings are that the detailed assessment of artificial intelligence in education, the use of AI in education, typical learning in the pandemic era, and the role of artificial intelligence (AI) disease outbreak learning are all important for both current and future residents. While statistical methods and automated based on learning jobs that are smarter than normal continue to be important, learning is becoming more automated. It helps individuals to be more concentrated on their learning opportunities and to recognize when they do not grasp a subject completely. First and foremost, the instructors provide valuable assistance throughout the assessment process of student learning outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease that affects the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), causing chronic pain and disability. To diagnose patients suffering from this disease before advanced degradation of the bone, we developed a diagnostic tool called TMJOAI. This machine learning based algorithm is capable of classifying the health status TMJ in of patients using 52 clinical, biological and jaw condyle radiomic markers. The TMJOAI includes three parts. the feature preparation, selection and model evaluation. Feature generation includes the choice of radiomic features (condylar trabecular bone or mandibular fossa), the histogram matching of the images prior to the extraction of the radiomic markers, the generation of feature pairwise interaction, etc.; the feature selection are based on the p-values or AUCs of single features using the training data; the model evaluation compares multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g. regression-based, tree-based and boosting algorithms) from 10 times 5-fold cross validation. The best performance was achieved with averaging the predictions of XGBoost and LightGBM models; and the inclusion of 32 additional markers from the mandibular fossa of the joint improved the AUC prediction performance from 0.83 to 0.88. After cross-validation and testing, the tools presented here have been deployed on an open-source, web-based system, making it accessible to clinicians. TMJOAI allows users to add data and automatically train and update the machine learning models, and therefore improve their performance.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-guided clinical decision support system, to predict radiation doses to subsites of the mandible using diagnostic computed tomography scans acquired before any planning of head and neck radiation therapy (RT).\nA dose classifier was trained using RT plans from 86 patients with oropharyngeal cancer; the test set consisted of an additional 20 plans. The classifier was trained to predict whether mandible subsites would receive a mean dose >50 Gy. The AI predictions were prospectively evaluated and compared with those of a specialist head and neck radiation oncologist for 9 patients. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Lin concordance correlation coefficient were calculated to compare the AI predictions to those of the physician.\nIn the test data set, the AI predictions had a PPV of 0.95 and NPV of 0.88. For 9 patients evaluated prospectively, there was a strong correlation between the predictions of the AI algorithm and physician (\nAI-guided decision support increased precision and accuracy of pre-RT dental dose estimates.",

    "abstract": "The present study aims to evaluate the distinct patterns of working memory (WM) capacity of children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), High-functioning children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and children with Down syndrome (DS). More specifically, the current study investigates the complex relationship of fluid intelligence and WM between 39 children with DLD, 20 H igh-functioning children with ASD, and 15 children with DS. All children were evaluated in different measures of Phonological Working Memory, Visual-spatial Working Memory whereas Fluid Intelligence was measured with Raven Progressive Matrices. The result analysis revealed a significant difference among the three groups, both among each function separately and the correlations among them, as well. The results revealed that the DLD groups and High-functioning ASD group exhibited a common picture or an overlap of performances in all Phonological and Visuo-spatial working memory measures, except Backward Digit Recall task. As for the DS group research findings revealed different and unique working memory patterns in comparison to DLD group and High-functioning ASD. Their differences have been studied and further conclusions have been drawn about the different patterns of working memory among the three clinical groups. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of support for learning. The common profile that characterize the two developmental conditions and the distinct pattern of working memory performance in DS group underlies the need for further research in the field.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the Artificial Intelligence in Renal Scarring (AIRS) study is to develop machine learning tools for noninvasive quantification of kidney fibrosis from imaging scans.\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who had one or more abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans within 6 months of a kidney biopsy. The final cohort encompassed 152 CT scans from 92 patients, which included images of 300 native kidneys and 76 transplant kidneys. Two different convolutional neural networks (slice-level and voxel-level classifiers) were tested to differentiate severe versus mild/moderate kidney fibrosis (\u226550% versus <50%). Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy scores from kidney biopsy reports were used as ground-truth.\nThe two machine learning models demonstrated similar positive predictive value (0.886 versus 0.935) and accuracy (0.831 versus 0.879).\nIn summary, machine learning algorithms are a promising noninvasive diagnostic tool to quantify kidney fibrosis from CT scans. The clinical utility of these prediction tools, in terms of avoiding renal biopsy and associated bleeding risks in patients with severe fibrosis, remains to be validated in prospective clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "OMIC datasets have high dimensions, and the connection among OMIC features is very complicated. It is difficult to establish linkages among these features and certain biological traits of significance. The proposed ensemble swarm intelligence-based approaches can identify key biomarkers and reduce feature dimension efficiently. It is an end-to-end method that only relies on the rules of the algorithm itself, without presets such as the number of filtering features. Additionally, this method achieves good classification accuracy without excessive consumption of computing resources.",

    "abstract": "Patient safety and efficiency are top priorities in any surgical procedure. One effective way to achieve these objectives is to automate the logistical and routine tasks that occur in the operating suite. Inspired by smart assistant technology already widely used in the consumer sector, we engineered the Smart Hospital Assistant (SHA), a smart, voice-controlled virtual assistant that handles natural speech recognition while executing non-surgical functions to aid any surgery. In simulated procedures, the SHA reduced operating time, optimized surgical staff resources, and reduced the number of major touch-points that can lead to surgical site infections. The SHA holds promise not only for use in the operating theater, but also in understaffed healthcare environments where automation can improve healthcare delivery.",

    "abstract": "Depression is more than just sentiment sad or passing a rough patch. It is a serious psychological wellbeing disorder that needs curative care and maintenance. Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a comprehensive personality construct denoting the capability to perceive and control affects within the self. Alexithymia is another personality construct that refers to the difficulty of recognizing and expressing feelings, with an outside oriented thinking style. Suicidal ideation is defined as thinking of appealing in conduct intentional to end one's life.\nThe current study aimed to examine the relationship between emotional intelligence, alexithymia and suicidal ideation among depressive patients.\nA descriptive correlation design was utilized.\nThis study was conducted at the Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic in El Ahrar Hospital, Alsharkia Governorate, Egypt.\nA purposeful sample of 65 depressed patients was recruited for this study.\nData were collected by using four tools: Socio-demographic Data Sheet, Emotional Intelligence Scales, Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and Suicidal Ideation Scale.\nThe majority of depressed patients were having alexithymia and having low emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence was statistically significantly negatively correlated with alexithymia and suicidal ideation. Nevertheless, alexithymia was statistically significantly positively correlated with suicidal ideation. It was statistically significantly positively predictor of suicidal ideation and alexithymia, while it was statistically significantly negatively predictor of suicidal ideation and emotional intelligence.\nLower emotional intelligence led to higher suicidal ideation in depressive patients. Increasing alexithymia in patients with depressive disorders caused an increase in their suicidal ideation. Therefore, it is recommended implementing a training program such as mindfulness and emotional intelligence skills for patients to enhance their emotional intelligence.",

A total of 176 patients were divided into a control group, a vascular cognitive impairment non-dementia (VCIND) group, a vascular dementia (VD) group, and an Alzheimer's disease (AD) group. All patients underwent MRI and neuropsychological evaluation and examination, and an improved fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm was proposed for MRI processing. It was found that the segmentation accuracy (SA) and similarity (KI) data of the improved FCM algorithm used in this study were higher than those of the standard FCM algorithm, bias-corrected FCM (BCFCM) algorithm, and rough FCM (RFCM) algorithm (",

    "abstract": "This study aims to explore new educational strategies suitable for the mental health education of college students. Big data and artificial intelligence (AI) are combined to evaluate the mental health education of college students in sports majors. First, the research status on the mental health education of college students is introduced. The internet of things (IoT) on mental health education, a structure based on big data and convolutional neural network (CNN), is constructed. Next, the survey design and questionnaire survey are carried out. Finally, the questionnaire data are analyzed and compared with the mental health status under traditional education. The results show that the CNN model has good accuracy and ability to distinguish symptoms, so it can be applied to the existing psychological work in colleges. In the symptom comparison survey, under the traditional education and big data network, the number of college students with mild mental health problems is found to be 158 (84.9%) and 170 (91.4%), respectively. It indicates that the number of college students with moderate mental health problems decreases significantly. In the comparative investigation of the severity of mental problems, the number of students with normal mental health, subhealth, and serious mental health problems under the background of traditional mental health education is 125 (67.2%), 56 (30.1%), and 5 (2.7%), respectively. The mental health status of college students under the influence of big data networks on mental health education is better than that of traditional mental health education. There are 140 students with normal mental health, a year-on-year increase of 16.7%. In the comparative survey of specific mental disorders, students with obsessive-compulsive symptoms under traditional mental health education account for 22.0% of the total sample, having the largest proportion. In the subhealth psychological group under the big data network on mental health education, the number of hostile students decreases by 7, which is the psychological factor with the most obvious improvement. Hence, the proposed path of mental health education is feasible.",

    "abstract": "How can an agency like the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (\"FDA\") effectively regulate software that is constantly learning and adapting to real-world data? Continuously learning algorithms pose significant public health risks if a medical device can change overtime to fundamentally alter the nature of a device post-market. This Article evaluates the FDA's proposed regulatory framework for artificially intelligent medical devices against the backdrop of the current technology, as well as industry professionals' desired trajectory, to determine whether the proposed regulatory framework can ensure safe and reliable medical devices without stifling innovation. Ultimately, the FDA succeeds in placing effective limits on continuously learning algorithms while giving manufacturers freedom to allow their devices to adapt to real-world data. The framework, however, does not give adequate attention to protecting patient data, monitoring cybersecurity, and ensuring safety and efficacy. The FDA, medical device industry, and relevant policymakers should increase oversight of these areas to protect patients and providers relying on this new technology.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, public health emergencies have occurred frequently, posing a serious threat to the regional economy and the safety of people's lives and property. In particular, the outbreak of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus this year has caused serious losses to the global economy. On this basis, this article attempts to use modern advanced artificial intelligence technology and modern social science and technology to provide technical assistance and support for the prevention and control of major public health incidents, in order to improve the Chinese government's public relations capabilities and response to public health emergencies. Ability and level. This article attempts to use 3S technology closely related to artificial intelligence technology to design and establish a public health emergency response system, so as to improve the government's response and decision-making ability to respond to and deal with public health emergencies, and reduce the occurrence of emergencies. The results showed that among the 298 respondents, 145 believed that public health emergencies depend on human-to-human transmission. Most event information is acceptable, while 169 people who rely on mobile phones for information think that most of them are acceptable, and 89 people who rely on TV media for information think that most of them are acceptable. It shows that the use of artificial intelligence technology can effectively solve and prevent the further development of the situation, and at the same time improve the government's ability and level to respond to major public health emergencies, and increase the government's prestige in the eyes of the public.",

    "abstract": "Natural products (NPs) are primarily recognized as privileged structures to interact with protein drug targets. Their unique characteristics and structural diversity continue to marvel scientists for developing NP-inspired medicines, even though the pharmaceutical industry has largely given up. High-performance computer hardware, extensive storage, accessible software and affordable online education have democratized the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in many sectors and research areas. The last decades have introduced natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, two subfields of AI, to tackle NP drug discovery challenges and open up opportunities. In this article, we review and discuss the rational applications of AI approaches developed to assist in discovering bioactive NPs and capturing the molecular \"patterns\" of these privileged structures for combinatorial design or target selectivity.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a new security aspect for a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET)-based IoT model using the concept of artificial intelligence. The Black Hole Attack (BHA) is considered one of the most affecting threats in the MANET in which the attacker node drops the entire data traffic and hence degrades the network performance. Therefore, it necessitates the designing of an algorithm that can protect the network from the BHA node. This article introduces Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV), a new updated routing protocol that combines the advantages of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques. The combination of the SVM with ANN is the novelty of the proposed model that helps to identify the attackers within the discovered route using the AODV routing mechanism. Here, the model is trained using ANN but the selection of training data is performed using the ABC fitness function followed by SVM. The role of ABC is to provide a better route for data transmission between the source and the destination node. The optimized route, suggested by ABC, is then passed to the SVM model along with the node's properties. Based on those properties ANN decides whether the node is a normal or an attacker node. The simulation analysis performed in MATLAB shows that the proposed work exhibits an improvement in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), throughput, and delay. To validate the system efficiency, a comparative analysis is performed against the existing approaches such as Decision Tree and Random Forest that indicate that the utilization of the SVM with ANN is a beneficial step regarding the detection of BHA attackers in the MANET-based IoT networks.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to other radiological challenges with success.\nWe aimed to assess AI methodologies used for left ventricular scar identification in CMR, imaging sequences used for training, and its diagnostic evaluation.\nFollowing PRISMA recommendations, a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, OpenDissertations, arXiv, and IEEE Xplore was undertaken to June 2021 for full-text publications assessing left ventricular scar identification algorithms. No pre-registration was undertaken. Random-effect meta-analysis was performed to assess Dice Coefficient (DSC) overlap of learning vs predefined thresholding methods.\nThirty-five articles were included for final review. Supervised and unsupervised learning models had similar DSC compared to predefined threshold models (0.616 vs 0.633, \nFeasibility of applying AI to the task of scar detection in CMR has been demonstrated, but model evaluation remains heterogenous.

    "abstract": "To develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm capable of comprehensive, human-like ECG interpretation and compare its diagnostic performance against conventional ECG interpretation methods.\nWe developed a novel AI-enabled ECG (AI-ECG) algorithm capable of complete 12-lead ECG interpretation. It was trained on nearly 2.5 million standard 12-lead ECGs from over 720,000 adult patients obtained at the Mayo Clinic ECG laboratory between 2007 and 2017. We then compared the need for human over-reading edits of the reports generated by the Marquette 12SL automated computer program, AI-ECG algorithm, and final clinical interpretations on 500 randomly selected ECGs from 500 patients. In a blinded fashion, 3 cardiac electrophysiologists adjudicated each interpretation as (1) ideal (ie, \nCardiologists determined that on average 202 (13.5%), 123 (8.2%), and 90 (6.0%) of the interpretations required major edits from the computer program, AI-ECG algorithm, and final clinical interpretations, respectively.

    "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic represents one of the greatest global health emergencies of the last few decades with indelible consequences for all societies throughout the world. The cost in terms of human lives lost is devastating on account of the high contagiousness and mortality rate of the virus. Millions of people have been infected, frequently requiring continuous assistance and monitoring. Smart healthcare technologies and Artificial Intelligence algorithms constitute promising solutions useful not only for the monitoring of patient care but also in order to support the early diagnosis, prevention and evaluation of Covid-19 in a faster and more accurate way. On the other hand, the necessity to realise reliable and precise smart healthcare solutions, able to acquire and process voice signals by means of appropriate Internet of Things devices in real-time, requires the identification of algorithms able to discriminate accurately between pathological and healthy subjects. In this paper, we explore and compare the performance of the main machine learning techniques in terms of their ability to correctly detect Covid-19 disorders through voice analysis. Several studies report, in fact, significant effects of this virus on voice production due to the considerable impairment of the respiratory apparatus. Vocal folds oscillations that are more asynchronous, asymmetrical and restricted are observed during phonation in Covid-19 patients. Voice sounds selected by the Coswara database, an available crowd-sourced database, have been e analysed and processed to evaluate the capacity of the main ML techniques to distinguish between healthy and pathological voices. All the analyses have been evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score and Receiver Operating Characteristic area. These show the reliability of the Support Vector Machine algorithm to detect the Covid-19 infections, achieving an accuracy equal to about 97%.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide explosion of interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has created a before-and-after moment in our lives by generating great improvements in such sectors as the automotive and food production industries. AI has even been called the fourth industrial revolution. Machine learning through AI is helping to improve professional processes and promises to transform the health care sector as we know it in various ways: 1) through applications able to promote health in the general population by providing high-quality information and offering advice for different segments of the population based on prediction models; 2) by developing prediction models based on anonymized clinical data, for preventive purposes in primary care; 3) by analyzing images to provide additional decision-making support for health care providers, for improving specialist care at the secondary level; and 4) through robotics applied to processes that promote health and well-being. However, the medical profession harbors doubts about whether this revolution is a threat or an opportunity owing to a lack of understanding of AI technology and the methods used to validate its applications. This article outlines basic aspects of AI as it is applied in dermatology and reviews the main advances achieved in the last 5 years.",

    "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with MRI findings reflecting underlying mesial temporal sclerosis. Identifying these MRI features is critical for the diagnosis and management of temporal lobe epilepsy. To date, this process relies on visual assessment by highly trained human experts (e.g. neuroradiologists, epileptologists). Artificial intelligence is increasingly recognized as a promising aid in the radiological evaluation of neurological diseases, yet its applications in temporal lobe epilepsy have been limited. Here, we applied a convolutional neural network to assess the classification accuracy of temporal lobe epilepsy based on structural MRI. We demonstrate that convoluted neural networks can achieve high accuracy in the identification of unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy cases even when the MRI had been originally interpreted as normal by experts. We show that accuracy can be potentiated by employing smoothed grey matter maps and a direct acyclic graphs approach. We further discuss the foundations for the development of computer-aided tools to assist with the diagnosis of epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the value of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted software in the diagnosis of lung nodules using a combination of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).\nA total of 113 patients with pulmonary nodules were screened using LDCT. For nodules with the largest diameters, an HRCT local-target scanning program (combined scanning scheme) and a conventional-dose CT scanning scheme were also performed. Lung nodules were subjectively assessed for image signs and compared by size and malignancy rate measured by AI-assisted software. The nodules were divided into improved visibility and identical visibility groups based on differences in the number of signs identified through the two schemes.\nThe nodule volume and malignancy probability for subsolid nodules significantly differed between the improved and identical visibility groups. For the combined scanning protocol, we observed significant between-group differences in subsolid nodule malignancy rates.\nUnder the operation and decision of AI, the combined scanning scheme may be beneficial for screening high-risk populations.",

Given the rapid advances in technology, computers are now able to learn and improve, imitating humanoid cognitive function. AI applications currently exist in various medical specialties, some of which are already in clinical use. This review presents the potential uses and limitations of AI in arthroplasty to provide a better understanding of the existing technology and future direction of this field.Recent literature demonstrates that the utilization of AI in the field of arthroplasty has the potential to improve patient care through better diagnosis, screening, planning, monitoring, and prediction. The implementation of AI technology will enable arthroplasty surgeons to provide patient-specific management in clinical decision making, preoperative health optimization, resource allocation, decision support, and early intervention. While this technology presents a variety of exciting opportunities, it also has several limitations and challenges that need to be overcome to ensure its safety and effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the general population's view on artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine with specific emphasis on 3 areas that have experienced major progress in AI research in the past few years, namely radiology, robotic surgery, and dermatology.\nFor this prospective study, the April 2020 Online Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences Panel Wave was used. Of the 3117 Longitudinal Internet Studies For The Social Sciences panel members contacted, 2411 completed the full questionnaire (77.4% response rate), after combining data from earlier waves, the final sample size was 1909. A total of 3 scales focusing on trust in the implementation of AI in radiology, robotic surgery, and dermatology were used. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of variance was used for comparison.\nThe overall means show that respondents have slightly more trust in AI in dermatology than in radiology and surgery. The means show that higher educated males, employed or student, of Western background, and those not admitted to a hospital in the past 12 months have more trust in AI. The trust in AI in radiology, robotic surgery, and dermatology is positively associated with belief in the efficiency of AI and these specific domains were negatively associated with distrust and accountability in AI in general.\nThe general population is more distrustful of AI in medicine unlike the overall optimistic views posed in the media. The level of trust is dependent on what medical area is subject to scrutiny. Certain demographic characteristics and individuals with a generally positive view on AI and its efficiency are significantly associated with higher levels of trust in AI.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to systematically review recent health economic evaluations (HEEs) of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare. The aim was to discuss pertinent methods, reporting quality and challenges for future implementation of AI in healthcare, and additionally advise future HEEs.\nA systematic literature review was conducted in 2 databases (PubMed and Scopus) for articles published in the last 5 years. Two reviewers performed independent screening, full-text inclusion, data extraction, and appraisal. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards and Philips checklist were used for the quality assessment of included studies.\nA total of 884 unique studies were identified; 20 were included for full-text review, covering a wide range of medical specialties and care pathway phases. The most commonly evaluated type of AI was automated medical image analysis models (n\u00a0= 9, 45%). The prevailing health economic analysis was cost minimization (n\u00a0= 8, 40%) with the costs saved per case as preferred outcome measure. A total of 9 studies (45%) reported model-based HEEs, 4 of which applied a time horizon >1 year. The evidence supporting the chosen analytical methods, assessment of uncertainty, and model structures was underreported. The reporting quality of the articles was moderate as on average studies reported on 66% of Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards items.\nHEEs of AI in healthcare are limited and often focus on costs rather than health impact. Surprisingly, model-based long-term evaluations are just as uncommon as model-based short-term evaluations. Consequently, insight into the actual benefits offered by AI is lagging behind current technological developments.",

    "abstract": "Clinical artificial intelligence (AI) is a novel technology, and few economic evaluations have focused on it to date. Before its wider implementation, it is important to highlight the aspects of AI that challenge traditional health technology assessment methods.\nWe used an existing broad value framework to assess potential ways AI can provide good value for money. We also developed a rubric of how economic evaluations of AI should vary depending on the case of its use.\nWe found that the measurement of core elements of value-health outcomes and cost-are complicated by AI because its generalizability across different populations is often unclear and because its use may necessitate reconfigured clinical processes. Clinicians' productivity may improve when AI is used. If poorly implemented though, AI may also cause clinicians' workload to increase. Some AI has been found to exacerbate health disparities. Nevertheless, AI may promote equity by expanding access to medical care and, when properly trained, providing unbiased diagnoses and prognoses. The approach to assessment of AI should vary based on its use case: AI that creates new clinical possibilities can improve outcomes, but regulation and evidence collection may be difficult; AI that extends clinical expertise can reduce disparities and lower costs but may result in overuse; and AI that automates clinicians' work can improve productivity but may reduce skills.\nThe potential uses of clinical AI create challenges for health technology assessment methods originally developed for pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Health economists should be prepared to examine data collection and methods used to train AI, as these may impact its future value.",

Clinicians' productivity may improve when AI is used. If poorly implemented though, AI may also cause clinicians' workload to increase. Some AI has been found to exacerbate health disparities. Nevertheless, AI may promote equity by expanding access to medical care and, when properly trained, providing unbiased diagnoses and prognoses. The approach to assessment of AI should vary based on its use case: AI that creates new clinical possibilities can improve outcomes, but regulation and evidence collection may be difficult; AI that extends clinical expertise can reduce disparities and lower costs but may result in overuse; and AI that automates clinicians' work can improve productivity but may reduce skills.",

    "abstract": "The advent of the intelligence age has injected new elements into the development of literature. The synergic modification of Anglo-American (AAL) traumatic narrative (TN) literature by artificial intelligence (AI) technology and interactive design (ID) psychology will produce new possibilities in literary creation. First, by studying natural language processing (NLP) technology, this study proposes a modification language model (LM) based on the double-layered recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm and constructs an intelligent language modification system based on the improved LM model. The results show that the performance of the proposed model is excellent; only about 30% of the respondents like AAL literature; the lack of common cultural background, appreciation difficulties, and language barriers have become the main reasons for the decline of reading willingness of AAL literature. Finally, AI technology and ID psychology are used to modify a famous TN work respectively and synergically, and the modified work is appreciated by respondents to collect their comments. The results corroborate that 62% of the respondents like original articles, but their likability scores have decreased for individually modified work by AI or ID psychology. In comparison, under the synergic modification efforts of AI and ID psychology, the popularity of the modified work has increased slightly, with 65% of the respondents showing a likability to read. Therefore, it is concluded that literary modification by single ID psychology or AI technology will reduce the reading threshold by trading off the literary value of the original work. The core of literary creation depends on human intelligence, and AI might still not be able to generate high-standard literary works independently because human minds and thoughts cannot be controlled and predicted by machines. The research results provide new ideas and improvement directions for the field of AI-assisted writing.",

    "abstract": "Development of a new dug is a very lengthy and highly expensive process since only preclinical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and toxicological studies include a multiple of in silico, in vitro, in vivo experimentations that traditionally last several years. In the present review, we briefly report some examples that demonstrate the power of the computer-assisted drug discovery process with some examples that are published and revealing the successful applications of artificial intelligence (AI) technology on this vivid area. Besides, we address the situation of drug repositioning (repurposing) in clinical applications. Yet few success stories in this regard that provide us with a clear evidence that AI will reveal its great potential in accelerating effective new drug finding. AI accelerates drug repurposing and AI approaches are altogether necessary and inevitable tools in new medicine development. In spite of the fact that AI in drug development is still in its infancy, the advancements in AI and machine-learning (ML) algorithms have an unprecedented potential. The AI/ML solutions driven by pharmaceutical scientists, computer scientists, statisticians, physicians and others are increasingly working together in the processes of drug development and are adopting AI-based technologies for the rapid discovery of medicines. AI approaches, coupled with big data, are expected to substantially improve the effectiveness of drug repurposing and finding new drugs for various complex human diseases.",

In this study, Artificial intelligence (AI) based models, namely the Adaptive-Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Multilayer perceptron (MLP) models, and Step-Wise-Linear Regression (SWLR) were used to predict total phenolic compounds (TPC) of the spirulina algae. Spirulina productivity (P), extraction yield (EY), total flavonoids (TF), percent of flavonoid (%F) and percent of phenols (%P) are considered as input variables with the corresponding TPC as an output variable. From the result, TPC has a high positive correlation with the input variables with R\u202f=\u202f0.99999. Also, the models showed that the ANFIS and SWLR gives superior result in the testing phase and increased its accuracy by 2% compared to MLP model in the prediction of TPC.",

Limited research, however, has focused on influences of the emotional atmosphere on young people's application of their emotional intelligence. This article seeks to provoke debates about the role played by accidental lessons arising from learning institutions emotional atmosphere on young people's ability to apply their emotional intelligence in the fight against life crises such as COVID-19. The target population was 617 young people, aged 15-35\u00a0years, and the researcher used Yamane's sample calculation formula in determining the sample size, which was 243. The researcher used two main data collection tools: a closed-ended questionnaire with 14 items and an interview guide with 10 open-ended questions. The validity of the 14-item questionnaire was determined by experts, whereas its reliability was determined using Cronbach ",

    "abstract": "It is of interest to document the views of medical professionals on the application of artificial intelligence (using known data for the prediction of unknown events) in clinical trials using a web survery with a structured questionnaire from 377 subjects. The questionnaire contained 17 statements which were categorised into awareness (1,2 statements), perception (3-10 statements) and opinion (11-17 statements). The data obtained was compared between the subjects using two tailed Fisher's exact test with p-value <0.05 for data significance analysis. Data shows that majority of professionals have possitive views on the application of artificial intelligence in clinical trials. This will accelarrate the drug evaluation process. However, the use of emerging tools such as AI will not replace human subjects in this context.",

    "abstract": "In the pandemic of COVID-19, it is crucial to consider the hygiene of the edible and nonedible things as it could be dangerous for our health to consume infected things. Furthermore, everything cannot be boiled before eating as it can destroy fruits and essential minerals and proteins. So, there is a dire need for a smart device that could sanitize edible items. The Germicidal Ultraviolet C (UVC) has proved the capabilities of destroying viruses and pathogens found on the surface of any objects. Although, a few minutes exposure to the UVC can destroy or inactivate the viruses and the pathogens, few doses of UVC light may damage the proteins of edible items and can affect the fruits and vegetables. To this end, we have proposed a novel design of a device that is employed with Artificial Intelligence along with UVC to auto detect the edible items and act accordingly. This causes limited UVC doses to be applied on different items as detected by proposed model according to their permissible limit. Additionally, the device is employed with a smart architecture which leads to consistent distribution of UVC light on the complete surface of the edible items. This results in saving the health as well as nutrition of edible items.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to make preoperative differential diagnoses between ameloblastoma (AME) and odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) on cone-beam CT (CBCT).\nThe CBCT images of 178 AMEs and 172 OKCs were retrospectively retrieved from the Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University. The datasets were randomly split into a training dataset of 272 cases and a testing dataset of 78 cases. Slices comprising lesions were retained and then cropped to suitable patches for training. The Inception v3 deep learning algorithm was utilized, and its diagnostic performance was compared with that of oral and maxillofacial surgeons.\nThe sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1 score were 87.2%, 82.1%, 84.6%, and 85.0%, respectively. Furthermore, the average scores of the same indexes for 7 senior oral and maxillofacial surgeons were 60.0%, 71.4%, 65.7%, and 63.6%, respectively, and those of 30 junior oral and maxillofacial surgeons were 63.9%, 53.2%, 58.5%, and 60.7%, respectively.\nThe deep learning model was able to differentiate these two lesions with better diagnostic accuracy than clinical surgeons. The results indicate that the CNN may provide assistance for clinical diagnosis, especially for inexperienced surgeons.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant changes in the lifestyle of students. However, despite an extensive study of students' life stress using a non-comprehensive scale and variable-centered approach, it has been little studied with a comprehensive scale and person-centered approach. Using the Student-Life Stress Inventory-revised (SSI-R), we analyzed students' latent stress profiles and examined differences in psychological resilience and emotional intelligence by comparing stress profiles from a sample of 418 undergraduate and graduate students (aged 18-36) in various departments of eight universities in Turkey. We identified five distinct stress profiles, defined as an extremely low stress group (ELSG), a low stress group (LSG), a medium stress group (MSG), a high stress group (HSG), and an extremely high stress group (EHSG). We found that (1) MSG and HSG were similar in terms of emotional intelligence, resilience, and possession of high standards, and they reported higher levels of physiological, emotional, and behavioral reactions than ELSG and LSG; (2) MSG felt more pressure than HSG; (3) ELSG reported higher levels of emotional intelligence (wellbeing, self-control, and emotionality) than others. Also, EHSG reported lower levels of emotional intelligence (specifically self-control) than others; (4) whereas resilience was highly positively correlated to wellbeing, resilience and wellbeing were moderately negatively correlated to stress. Extremely low stress group and LSG reported higher levels of resilience than others. Medium stress group, HSG, and EHSG did not differ with regard to resilience and wellbeing. Our results suggest that, university students are able to maintain their functionality by coping up with stress in some ways, no matter how stressful they are. These findings are discussed in relation to the relevant literature.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) are jointly applied to concrete piano teaching for children to comprehensively promote modern piano teaching and improve the overall teaching quality. First, the teaching environment and the functions of the intelligent piano are expounded. Then, a piano note onset detection method is proposed based on the convolution neural network (CNN). The network can analyze the time-frequency of the input piano music signal by transforming the original time-domain waveform of the piano music signal into the frequency distribution varying with time. Besides, it can detect the note onset at a stable state after 8 \u00d7 10",

    "abstract": "The current study investigated correlations among gifted students' academic performance; emotional, social, analytical, creative, and practical intelligence; and their implicit theories of intelligence. Furthermore, it studied the effect of gender and grade on these variables. The participants included 174 gifted fifth (41.4%) and sixth (58.6%) grade students, comprising 53.4% male and 46.6% female. The following analytical, creative, and practical intelligence tests were administered: Aurora Battery, the emotional intelligence scale, the implicit theories of intelligence scale, and an assessment scale of students' performances. The results revealed significant correlations among academic performance, kinds of intelligence, and implicit theories of intelligence. There were no significant differences between the male and female students in these measures. There were, however, significant differences between the fifth and sixth grade students, with the sixth-grade students showing higher levels of all kinds of intelligence, except emotional intelligence. Moreover, the results indicated that the intelligence measures were non-significantly affected by either gender or gender-grade interaction. Overall, our results showed that most types of intelligence are related to giftedness, and that there were no gender differences among gifted students on measures of intelligence.",

    "abstract": "The medical profession deals with 'humanism' which involves interactions with people, the ability to think about them, care for them, and to provide positive reinforcement in clinical follow-ups. Emotional intelligence integrates the significant features of personal relationships to promote self-management skills, like adaptability, control of temperaments and reduction of tension, which can improve performance of individuals. This has led to increasing interest in the importance of emotional intelligence for effective academic growth, professional experiences and clinical practice. There are many studies examining the correlation between emotional intelligence and academic achievement at different education levels, signifying its importance to predict students who need guided intervention. With proven relationship between emotional intelligence and academic success, the assessment of emotional intelligence can be introduced in entrance exams of medical schools to recognise students who might need directed intermediation. With the agreement of all stakeholders, emotional intelligence training workshops and awareness sessions can be introduced for educators and students.",

    "abstract": "Negation is widely present in human communication, yet it is largely neglected in the research on conversational agents based on neural network architectures. Cognitive studies show that a supportive visual context makes the processing of negation easier. We take GuessWhat?!, a referential visually grounded guessing game, as test-bed and evaluate to which extent guessers based on pre-trained language models profit from negatively answered polar questions. Moreover, to get a better grasp of models' results, we select a controlled sample of games and run a crowdsourcing experiment with subjects. We evaluate models and humans against the same settings and use the comparison to better interpret the models' results. We show that while humans profit from negatively answered questions to solve the task, models struggle in grounding negation, and some of them barely use it; however, when the language signal is poorly informative, visual features help encoding the negative information. Finally, the experiments with human subjects put us in the position of comparing humans and models' predictions and get a grasp about which models make errors that are more human-like and as such more plausible.",

    "abstract": "Legalized use of cannabis products and the rising interest in their therapeutic benefits have opened up new opportunities for therapy and marketing. However, the marked variability in formulations, administration modes, therapeutic regimens, and inter- and intra-subject responses make the standardization of medical cannabis-based regimens difficult. Legalization has made the cannabis market highly competitive and lowered the revenue margins. This study reviews some of the challenges in medical cannabis use and difficulties in standardizing its therapeutic regimens that hinder maximizing its beneficial effects. The development of tolerance toward cannabis and low adherence to chronic administration further impair its long-term beneficial effects. Digital medical cannabis is a cannabis product controlled by a second-generation artificial intelligence (AI) system that improves patient responses by increasing adherence and dealing with tolerance. Second-generation AI systems focus on a single patient's outcome and deal with the inter- and intra-subject variability in responses. The use of digital medical cannabis is expected to improve product standardization, maximize therapeutic benefits, reduce health care costs, and increase the revenue of companies. Digital medical cannabis offers several market differentiators for cannabis companies. This study presents a model for promoting the use of digital medical cannabis and presents its advantages for patients, clinicians, health care authorities, insurance companies, and cannabis manufacturers. Ongoing trials and real-world data on the use of these systems further support the use of digital medical cannabis for improved global health.",

    "abstract": "In children's learning subjects, English courses has its relative particularity compared with Chinese courses and the mathematics. Children's English teaching is often inefficient because of the lack of students' timely consolidation after class. Given this, the present work starts with the analysis of the current situation of children's learning, and introduces the film-assisted English teaching. In the specific teaching links, English teaching is carried out in a three-dimensional teaching mode. Before that, topics of the films are selected for the English teaching, and the films are edited and processed. Initially, the present work expounds the English children's films and their educational functions. Then, children can obtain teaching effect from the films. An English questionnaire is designed to analyze the application effect of English films in children's English teaching. The results show that the film teaching mode improves children's learning interest and motivation, and English film teaching can stimulate students' learning interest. Students are also more active to participate in teaching activities, thus improving their language skills. Under the teaching in the scenes of films, students can perceive the functions of language in certain contexts. Comprehensible language input promotes students' English listening ability and oral expression ability. The films can intuitively show the humanistic style, historical geography, cultures, and customs of English countries, and then cultivate students' western cultural literacy. Practice has proved that the method proposed here can achieve good teaching effect, and it provides certain references for children's English education.",

    "abstract": "The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care is expanding rapidly. Currently, there are at least 29 US Food and Drug Administration-approved AI health care devices that apply to numerous medical specialties and many more are in development.\nWith increasing expectations for all health care sectors to deliver timely, fiscally-responsible, high-quality health care, AI has potential utility in numerous areas, such as image analysis, improved workflow and efficiency, public health, and epidemiology, to aid in processing large volumes of patient and medical data. In this review, we describe basic terminology, principles, and general AI applications relating to health care. We then discuss current and future applications for a variety of medical specialties. Finally, we discuss the future potential of AI along with the potential risks and limitations of current AI technology.\nAI can improve diagnostic accuracy, increase patient safety, assist with patient triage, monitor disease progression, and assist with treatment decisions.",

    "abstract": "Network operation and maintenance (O & M) activities of data centers focus mainly on checking the operating states of devices. O & M engineers determine how services are running and the bearing capacity of a data center by checking the operating states of devices. However, this method cannot reflect the real transmission status of business data; therefore, engineers cannot fully comprehensively perceive the overall running conditions of businesses. In this paper, ERSPAN (Encapsulated Remote Switch Port Analyzer) technology is applied to deliver stream matching rules in the forwarding path of TCP packets and mirror the TCP packets into the network O & M AI collector, which is used to conduct an in-depth analysis on the TCP packets, collect traffic statistics, recapture the forwarding path, carry out delayed computing, and identify applications. This enables O & M engineers to comprehensively perceive the service bearing status in a data center, and form a tightly coupled correlation model between networks and services through end-to-end visualized modeling, providing comprehensive technical support for data center optimization and early warning of network risks.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders have the highest prevalence of all psychiatric disorders in China. Medication and psychotherapy are two main treatment approaches for this group of disorders, and when used in combinations are significantly more beneficial than medication alone. The resources are insufficient. The availability of psychotherapy is low due to the limited resources. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted psychotherapy offers an opportunity to develop an efficient and standardized psychotherapy model and improve the availability of psychotherapy, which is key to improve the clinical efficacy of anxiety disorder treatments.\nThe present protocol aims to determine whether medication plus AI-assisted psychotherapy has greater efficacy than medication alone in the treatment of anxiety disorders.\nWe will recruit patients in eight hospitals in China. Seven hundred and eight patients with anxiety disorders will be randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to either medication plus AI-assisted psychotherapy group, or medication alone group. We have built an AI psychotherapy robot named XIAO AN. In this study we will deliver psychotherapy to patients in the medication plus AI-assisted psychotherapy group. Patients will be assessed at baseline and at the end of week 2, 4, 8, and 12. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 3 and 6 months posttreatment. The primary outcome is change of Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) score from baseline the end of 12-week treatment. A secondary efficacy outcome will be improvement in treatment at an early stage (score reduction in HAMA \u226525% after 2 weeks of treatment). Other measurements include Hamilton Depression Scale, Clinical Global Impression, Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale, Social Disability Screening Schedule, Insomnia Severity Index and so on. Scales will be assessed by independent raters who are blind to treatment allocation and analyses will be conducted by a statistician who is also blind to treatment allocation.\nThis will be the first multicentered randomized controlled single-blind trial in China to assess the efficacy of medication plus AI-assisted psychotherapy compared with medication alone for anxiety disorders. The study has the potential to address the limitations of the limited availability of psychotherapy, and to augment the efficacy of the treatment of anxiety disorders in China.",

Medicine is a major focus point of AI developers. There are examples of algorithms on par with medical professionals, the most prominent case being skin cancer recognition. However, advancement involves the necessity to adapt to technology and to patients utilizing it on a daily basis. What is more, patients present growing trust towards machine-aided health care. Dermatology is a potent field for AI use as visual data are easy to collect, hold a lot of information and are paramount for diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Despite widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), most hospitals are not ready to implement data science research in the clinical pipelines. Here, we develop MEDomics, a continuously learning infrastructure through which multimodal health data are systematically organized and data quality is assessed with the goal of applying artificial intelligence for individual prognosis. Using this framework, currently composed of thousands of individuals with cancer and millions of data points over a decade of data recording, we demonstrate prognostic utility of this framework in oncology. As proof of concept, we report an analysis using this infrastructure, which identified the Framingham risk score to be robustly associated with mortality among individuals with early-stage and advanced-stage cancer, a potentially actionable finding from a real-world cohort of individuals with cancer. Finally, we show how natural language processing (NLP) of medical notes could be used to continuously update estimates of prognosis as a given individual's disease course unfolds.",

    "abstract": "The success of IVF has remained stagnant for a decade. The focus of a great deal of research is to improve on the current ~30% success rate of IVF. Artificial intelligence (AI), or machines that mimic human intelligence, has been gaining traction for its potential to improve outcomes in medicine, such as cancer diagnosis from medical images. In this commentary, we discuss whether AI has the potential to improve fertility outcomes in the IVF clinic. Based on existing research, we examine the potential of adopting AI within multiple facets of an IVF cycle, including egg/sperm and embryo selection, as well as formulation of an IVF treatment regimen. We discuss both the potential benefits and concerns of the patient and clinician in adopting AI in the clinic. We outline hurdles that need to be overcome prior to implementation. We conclude that AI has an important future in improving IVF success.",

    "abstract": "Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is a rare, malignant cutaneous adenocarcinoma with a high recurrence rate after surgical resection. Early diagnosis of EMPD is critical as 15%-40% of cases progress into an invasive form and resulting in a dismal prognosis. However, EMPD can be a diagnostic challenge to pathologists, especially in the grassroots hospital, because of its low incidence and nonspecific clinical presentation. Although AI-enabled computer-aided diagnosis solutions have been extensively used in dermatological pathological image analysis to diagnose common skin cancers such as melanoma and basal cell carcinoma, these techniques have yet been applied to diagnose EMPD. Here, we developed and verified a deep learning method with five different deep convolutional neural networks, named ResNet34, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, GoogLeNet, and VGG16, in Asian EMPD pathological image screening to distinguish between Paget's and normal cells. We further demonstrated that the results of the proposed method are quantitative, fast, and repeatable by a retrospective single-center study. The ResNet34 model achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 95.522% in pathological images collected at a magnification of \u00d740. We envision this method can potentially empower grassroots pathologists' efficiency and accuracy as well as to ultimately provide better patient care.",

    "abstract": "This review was conducted to systematically summarize the progress made by artificial intelligence technology in early screening based medical imaging, pathological diagnosis, genomics inspection, prognostic evaluation, and individual treatment of lung cancer.\nLung cancer has a high mortality rate in China, which is closely related to the fact that most lung cancer patients are not diagnosed until the malignancy is advanced. Challenges remain in the early detection, accurate diagnosis, monitoring and individual treatment of lung cancers. Artificial intelligence has developed to process large amounts of data, from clinical presentations to physiological images, which is essential for solving the complex issues with clinical medicine. Increasing evidence has suggested that artificial intelligence technology provides novel, promising strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer.\nA review of literature was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane to identify the latest research on artificial intelligence and lung cancer, and ultimately to generate a narrative review.\nArtificial intelligence plays an important role in the imaging inspection, histopathology examination and genomics inspection of lung cancer. In addition, artificial intelligence has the ability to detect a small number of biomarkers, which is conducive to lung cancer monitoring. Moreover, the intelligent treatment of lung cancer has gradually become the trend of future development, whether in internal medicine or surgical treatment. It is believed that artificial intelligence could improve the early diagnosis of lung cancer and assist doctors in treating lung cancer patients individually.",

    "abstract": "Aiming to increase the shelf life of food, researchers are moving toward new methodologies to maintain the quality of food as food grains are susceptible to spoilage due to precipitation, humidity, temperature, and a variety of other influences. As a result, efficient food spoilage tracking schemes are required to sustain food quality levels. We have designed a prototype to track food quality and to manage storage systems at home. Initially, we have employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect the type of fruit and veggies. Then the proposed system monitors the gas emission level, humidity level, and temperature of fruits and veggies by using sensors and actuators to check the food spoilage level. This would additionally control the environment and avoid food spoilage wherever possible. Additionally, the food spoilage level is informed to the customer by an alert message sent to their registered mobile numbers based on the freshness and condition of the food. The model employed proved to have an accuracy rate of 95%. Finally, the experiment is successful in increasing the shelf life of some categories of food by 2 days.",

    "abstract": "Technology has advanced surgery, especially minimally invasive surgery (MIS), including laparoscopic surgery and robotic surgery. It has led to an increase in the number of technologies in the operating room. They can provide further information about a surgical procedure, e.g. instrument usage and trajectories. Among these surgery-related technologies, the amount of information extracted from a surgical video captured by an endoscope is especially great. Therefore, the automation of data analysis is essential in surgery to reduce the complexity of the data while maximizing its utility to enable new opportunities for research and development. Computer vision (CV) is the field of study that deals with how computers can understand digital images or videos and seeks to automate tasks that can be performed by the human visual system. Because this field deals with all the processes of real-world information acquisition by computers, the terminology \"CV\" is extensive, and ranges from hardware for image sensing to AI-based image recognition. AI-based image recognition for simple tasks, such as recognizing snapshots, has advanced and is comparable to humans in recent years. Although surgical video recognition is a more complex and challenging task, if we can effectively apply it to MIS, it leads to future surgical advancements, such as intraoperative decision-making support and image navigation surgery. Ultimately, automated surgery might be realized. In this article, we summarize the recent advances and future perspectives of AI-related research and development in the field of surgery.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the emotional intelligence of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients.\nThis was a descriptive cross-sectional study that was conducted from May to July 2020 in Tehran, Iran. Nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 were requested to fill in Bradbury and Graves's questionnaire online using a questionnaire in electronic format.\nFinally 211 nurses completed the questionnaires. Most of the nurses were working in critical care wards and caring for critical patients (61.6). Nurses' emotional intelligence was reported to be 63.19 (8.22). In general, the nurses' emotional intelligence was moderate. Between the dimensions, self-awareness and self-management had the highest scores. Also, the lowest score was related to self-management. The ward type and complexity of care had no effect on the scores of emotional intelligence. Nurses caring for patients with moderate disease severity had a higher relationship management score than nurses caring for critically ill patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nThe total score of emotional intelligence was moderate. Due to the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the possibility of mental and physical fatigue of health care workers, improving emotional intelligence can be effective in resilience and stability of the psychological status of employees.",

    "abstract": "Research on technologies based on artificial intelligence in healthcare has increased during the last decade, with applications showing great potential in assisting and improving care. However, introducing these technologies into nursing can raise concerns related to data bias in the context of training algorithms and potential implications for certain populations. Little evidence exists in the extant literature regarding the efficacious application of many artificial intelligence -based health technologies used in healthcare.\nTo synthesize currently available state-of the-art research in artificial intelligence -based technologies applied in nursing practice.\nScoping review METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and IEEE Xplore were searched for relevant articles with queries that combine names and terms related to nursing, artificial intelligence and machine learning methods. Included studies focused on developing or validating artificial intelligence -based technologies with a clear description of their impacts on nursing. We excluded non-experimental studies and research targeted at robotics, nursing management and technologies used in nursing research and education.\nA total of 7610 articles published between January 2010 and March 2021 were revealed, with 93 articles included in this review. Most studies explored the technology development (n\u00a0=\u00a055, 59.1%) and formation (testing) (n\u00a0=\u00a028, 30.1%) phases, followed by implementation (n\u00a0=\u00a09, 9.7%) and operational (n\u00a0=\u00a01, 1.1%) phases. The vast majority (73.1%) of studies provided evidence with a descriptive design (level VI) while only a small portion (4.3%) were randomised controlled trials (level II). The study aims, settings and methods were poorly described in the articles, and discussion of ethical considerations were lacking in 36.6% of studies. Additionally, one-third of papers (33.3%) were reported without the involvement of nurses.\nContemporary research on applications of artificial intelligence -based technologies in nursing mainly cover the earlier stages of technology development, leaving scarce evidence of the impact of these technologies and implementation aspects into practice. The content of research reported is varied. Therefore, guidelines on research reporting and implementing artificial intelligence -based technologies in nursing are needed. Furthermore, integrating basic knowledge of artificial intelligence -related technologies and their applications in nursing education is imperative, and interventions to increase the inclusion of nurses throughout the technology research and development process is needed.",

    "abstract": "Digital pathology, in its primary meaning, describes the utilization of computer screens to view scanned histology slides. Digitized tissue sections can be easily shared for a second opinion. In addition, it allows tissue image analysis using specialized software to identify and measure events previously observed by a human observer. These tissue-based readouts were highly reproducible and precise. Digital pathology has developed over the years through new technologies. Currently, the most discussed development is the application of artificial intelligence to automatically analyze tissue images. However, even new label-free imaging technologies are being developed to allow imaging of tissues by means of their molecular composition.\nThis review provides a summary of the current state-of-the-art and future digital pathologies. Developments in the last few years have been presented and discussed. In particular, the review provides an outlook on interesting new technologies (e.g., infrared imaging), which would allow for deeper understanding and analysis of tissue thin sections beyond conventional histopathology.\nIn digital pathology, mathematical methods are used to analyze images and draw conclusions about diseases and their progression. New innovative methods and techniques (e.g., label-free infrared imaging) will bring significant changes in the field in the coming years.",

    "abstract": "The quality of service in healthcare is constantly challenged by outlier events such as pandemics (i.e., Covid-19) and natural disasters (such as hurricanes and earthquakes). In most cases, such events lead to critical uncertainties in decision-making, as well as in multiple medical and economic aspects at a hospital. External (geographic) or internal factors (medical and managerial) lead to shifts in planning and budgeting, but most importantly, reduce confidence in conventional processes. In some cases, support from other hospitals proves necessary, which exacerbates the planning aspect. This paper presents three data-driven methods that provide data-driven indicators to help healthcare managers organize their economics and identify the most optimum plan for resources allocation and sharing. Conventional decision-making methods fall short in recommending validated policies for managers. Using reinforcement learning, genetic algorithms, traveling salesman, and clustering, we experimented with different healthcare variables and presented tools and outcomes that could be applied at health institutes. Experiments are performed; the results are recorded, evaluated, and presented.",

    "abstract": "Owing to their rapid development, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offer a great promise for gastroenterology practice and research. At present, AI-guided image interpretation has already been used with success for endoscopic detection of early malignant lesions. Nonetheless, there are complex challenges and possible shortcomings that must be considered before full implementation can be realized.\nIn this review, the current status of AI in endoscopy is summarized. Future perspectives and open questions for further studies are stressed.\nThe usage of AI algorithms for polyp detection in screening colonoscopy results in a significant increase in the adenoma detection rate, mainly attributed to the identification of diminutive polyps. Computer-aided characterization of colorectal polyps accompanies the detection, but further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical benefit. In contrast to colonoscopy, usage of AI in gastroscopy is currently rather limited. Regarding other fields of endoscopic imaging, capsule endoscopy is the ideal imaging platform for AI, due to the potential of saving time in the video analysis.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the area of knowledge that develops computerised models to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These algorithms are programmed to learn and identify patterns from \"training data,\" that can be subsequently applied to new datasets, without being explicitly programmed to do so. AI is revolutionising the field of medical imaging and in particular of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) by providing deep learning solutions for image acquisition, reconstruction and analysis, ultimately supporting the clinical decision making. Numerous methods have been developed over recent years to enhance and expedite CMR data acquisition, image reconstruction, post-processing and analysis; along with the development of promising AI-based biomarkers for a wide spectrum of cardiac conditions. The exponential rise in the availability and complexity of CMR data has fostered the development of different AI models. Integration in clinical routine in a meaningful way remains a challenge. Currently, innovations in this field are still mostly presented in proof-of-concept studies with emphasis on the engineering solutions; often recruiting small patient cohorts or relying on standardised databases such as Multi-ethnic Study on atherosclerosis (MESA), UK Biobank and others. The wider incorporation of clinically valid endpoints such as symptoms, survival, need and response to treatment remains to be seen. This review briefly summarises the current principles of AI employed in CMR and explores the relevant prospective observational studies in cardiology patient cohorts. It provides an overview of clinical studies employing undersampled reconstruction techniques to speed up the scan encompassing cine imaging, whole-heart imaging, multi-parametric mapping and magnetic resonance fingerprinting along with the clinical utility of AI applications in image post-processing, and analysis. Specific focus is given to studies that have incorporated CMR-derived prediction models for prognostication in cardiac disease. It also discusses current limitations and proposes potential developments to enable multi-disciplinary collaboration for improved evidence-based medicine. AI is an extremely promising field and the timely integration of clinician's input in the ingenious technical investigator's paradigm holds promise for a bright future in the medical field.",

    "abstract": "Combat sports and martial arts are often associated with aggressiveness among the general public, although data on judo and/or martial arts and aggressiveness seem to be unclear. This research aims to compare athletes who have trained judo for a prolonged time (minimum 5 years) and athletes from various team sports, primarily regarding the manifestation of aggression, but also regarding personality traits, emotional intelligence, and self-efficacy. Also, the potential predictive value of personality traits, emotional intelligence, and self-efficacy for aggression within subsamples of judokas and team athletes was tested. The research findings showed that professional judo athletes are characterized by a low degree of aggression, especially low indirect and physical manifestations of aggression. In addition, the personality traits Honesty-Humility and Openness to experience are well expressed, contrary to Emotionality and Extraversion, which are less pronounced. They are also characterized by moderate general self-efficacy. On the other hand, members of team sports produced the opposite results, as they are characterized by increased aggression, pronounced traits of Emotionality and Extraversion, somewhat less pronounced traits of Honesty-Humility, Openness to new experience, and less pronounced general self-efficacy. The percentage of explained variability of aggression is slightly higher in the subsample of team sports and constitutes 49.9% of the variability, while in the subsample of judokas it constitutes 47.8% of the variability of the criteria. Practical implications, limitations, and future research directions were discussed.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the mediating role of emotional regulation strategies in the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and subjective well-being (SWB) among Chinese university teachers, and evaluate whether effort-reward imbalance moderated the mediating effect of emotional regulation strategies. A total of 308 Chinese university teachers were recruited for this study. The results showed that emotional regulation strategies played a partial mediating role in the relationship between EI and SWB. Moreover, an effort-reward imbalance moderated the relationship between emotional regulation strategies and SWB. For individuals with more balanced perceptions, EI had a significant effect on SWB ",

    "abstract": "Managing patient expectations is important to ensuring patient satisfaction in aesthetic medicine. To this end, computer technology developed to photograph, digitize, and manipulate three-dimensional (3D) objects has been applied to the female breast. However, the systems remain complex, physically cumbersome, and extremely expensive.\nThe authors of the current study wish to introduce the plastic surgery community to BreastGAN, a portable, artificial intelligence (AI)-equipped tool trained on real clinical images to simulate breast augmentation outcomes.\nCharts of all patients who underwent bilateral breast augmentation performed by the senior author were retrieved and analyzed. Frontal before and after images were collected from each patient's chart, cropped in a standardized fashion, and used to train a neural network designed to manipulate before images to simulate a surgical result. AI-generated frontal after images were then compared with the real surgical results.\nStandardizing the evaluation of surgical results is a timeless challenge which persists in the context of AI-synthesized after images. In this study, AI-generated images were comparable to real surgical results.\nThis study features a portable, cost-effective neural network trained on real clinical images and designed to simulate surgical results following bilateral breast augmentation. Tools trained on a larger dataset of standardized surgical image pairs will be the subject of future studies.",

    "abstract": "As a joint effort from various communities involved in the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid, the Operational Intelligence project aims at increasing the level of automation in computing operations and reducing human interventions. The distributed computing systems currently deployed by the LHC experiments have proven to be mature and capable of meeting the experimental goals, by allowing timely delivery of scientific results. However, a substantial number of interventions from software developers, shifters, and operational teams is needed to efficiently manage such heterogenous infrastructures. Under the scope of the Operational Intelligence project, experts from several areas have gathered to propose and work on \"smart\" solutions. Machine learning, data mining, log analysis, and anomaly detection are only some of the tools we have evaluated for our use cases. In this community study contribution, we report on the development of a suite of operational intelligence services to cover various use cases: workload management, data management, and site operations.",

    "abstract": "Clinical management of subsolid nodules (SSNs) is defined by the suspicion of tumor invasiveness. We sought to develop an artificial intelligent (AI) algorithm for invasiveness assessment of lung adenocarcinoma manifesting as radiological SSNs. We investigated the performance of this algorithm in classification of SSNs related to invasiveness.\nA retrospective chest computed tomography (CT) dataset of 1,589 SSNs was constructed to develop (85%) and internally test (15%) the proposed AI diagnostic tool, SSNet. Diagnostic performance was evaluated in the hold-out test set and was further tested in an external cohort of 102 SSNs. Three thoracic surgeons and three radiologists were required to evaluate the invasiveness of SSNs on both test datasets to investigate the clinical utility of the proposed SSNet.\nIn the differentiation of invasive adenocarcinoma (IA), SSNet achieved a similar area under the curve [AUC; 0.914, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.813-0.987] with that of the 6 doctors (0.900, 95% CI: 0.867-0.922). When interpreting with the assistance of SSNet, the sensitivity of junior doctors, specificity of senior doctor, and their accuracy were significantly improved. In the external test, SSNet (AUC: 0.949, 95% CI: 0.884-1.000) achieved a better AUC than doctors (AUC: 0.883, 95% CI: 0.826-0.939) whose AUC increased (AUC: 0.908, 95% CI: 0.847-0.982) with SSNet assistance. In the histological subtype classifications, SSNet achieved better performance than practicing doctors. The AUCs of doctors were significantly improved with the assistance of SSNet in both 4-category and 3-category classifications to 0.836 (95% CI: 0.811-0.862) and 0.852 (95% CI: 0.825-0.882), respectively.\nThe AI diagnostic system achieved non-inferior performance to doctors, and will potentially improve diagnostic performance and efficiency in SSN evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a large-scale global epidemic, impacting international politics and the economy. At present, there is no particularly effective medicine and treatment plan. Therefore, it is urgent and significant to find new technologies to diagnose early, isolate early, and treat early. Multimodal data drove artificial intelligence (AI) can potentially be the option. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, AI provided cutting-edge applications in disease, medicine, treatment, and target recognition. This paper reviewed the literature on the intersection of AI and medicine to analyze and compare different AI model applications in the COVID-19 Pandemic, evaluate their effectiveness, show their advantages and differences, and introduce the main models and their characteristics.\nWe searched PubMed, arXiv, medRxiv, and Google Scholar through February 2020 to identify studies on AI applications in the medical areas for the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nWe summarize the main AI applications in six areas: (I) epidemiology, (II) diagnosis, (III) progression, (IV) treatment, (V) psychological health impact, and (VI) data security. The ongoing development in AI has significantly improved prediction, contact tracing, screening, diagnosis, treatment, medication, and vaccine development for the COVID-19 Pandemic and reducing human intervention in medical practice.\nThis paper provides strong advice for using AI-based auxiliary tools for related applications of human diseases. We also discuss the clinicians' role in the further development of AI. They and AI researchers can integrate AI technology with current clinical processes and information systems into applications. In the future, AI personnel and medical workers will further cooperate closely.",

    "abstract": "In this review, we aim to present frontier studies in patients with lung cancer as it related to artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted decision-making and summarize the latest advances, challenges and future trend in this field.\nDespite increasing survival rate in cancer patients over the last decades, lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The early diagnosis, accurate evaluation and individualized treatment are vital approaches to improve the survival rate of patients with lung cancer. Thus, decision making based on these approaches requires accuracy and efficiency beyond manpower. Recent advances in AI and precision medicine have provided a fertile environment for the development of AI-based models. These models have the potential to assist radiologists and oncologists in detecting lung cancer, predicting prognosis and developing personalized treatment plans for better outcomes of the patients.\nWe searched literature from 2000 through July 31\nAI, especially for those based on deep learning and radiomics, is capable of assisting clinical decision making from many aspects, for its quantitatively interpretation of patients' information and its potential to deal with the dynamics, individual differences and heterogeneity of lung cancer. Hopefully, remaining problems such as insufficient data and poor interpretability may be solved to put AI-based models into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "To summarize the current evidence regarding the applications, workflow, and limitations of artificial intelligence (AI) in the management of patients pathologically-diagnosed with lung cancer.\nLung cancer is one of the most common cancers and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. AI technologies have been applied to daily medical workflow and have achieved an excellent performance in predicting histopathologic subtypes, analyzing gene mutation profiles, and assisting in clinical decision-making for lung cancer treatment. More advanced deep learning for classifying pathologic images with minimal human interactions has been developed in addition to the conventional machine learning scheme.\nStudies were identified by searching databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, up to February 2021 without language restrictions.\nA number of studies have evaluated AI pipelines and confirmed that AI is robust and efficacious in lung cancer diagnosis and decision-making, demonstrating that AI models are a useful tool for assisting oncologists in health management. Although several limitations that pose an obstacle for the widespread use of AI schemes persist, the unceasing refinement of AI techniques is poised to overcome such problems. Thus, AI technology is a promising tool for use in diagnosing and managing lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "In this golden age of rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), researchers and surgeons realized that AI could contribute to healthcare in all aspects, especially in surgery. The popularity of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and the improvement of the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) not only bring opportunities for thoracic surgery but also bring challenges on the way forward. Preoperatively localizing lung nodules precisely, intraoperatively identifying anatomical structures accurately, and avoiding complications requires a visual display of individuals' specific anatomy for surgical simulation and assistance. With the advance of AI-assisted display technologies, including 3D reconstruction/3D printing, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), computer tomography (CT) imaging in thoracic surgery has been fully utilized for transforming 2D images to 3D model, which facilitates surgical teaching, planning, and simulation. AI-assisted display based on surgical videos is a new surgical application, which is still in its infancy. Notably, it has potential applications in thoracic surgery education, surgical quality evaluation, intraoperative assistance, and postoperative analysis. In this review, we illustrated the current AI-assisted display applications based on CT in thoracic surgery; focused on the emerging AI applications in thoracic surgery based on surgical videos by reviewing its relevant researches in other surgical fields and anticipate its potential development in thoracic surgery.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this article is to review the current applications of artificial intelligence in thoracic surgery, from diagnosis and pulmonary disease management, to preoperative risk-assessment, surgical planning, and outcomes prediction.\nArtificial intelligence implementation in healthcare settings is rapidly growing, though its widespread use in clinical practice is still limited. The employment of machine learning algorithms in thoracic surgery is wide-ranging, including all steps of the clinical pathway.\nWe performed a narrative review of the literature on Scopus, PubMed and Cochrane databases, including all the relevant studies published in the last ten years, until March 2021.\nMachine learning methods are promising encouraging results throughout the key issues of thoracic surgery, both clinical, organizational, and educational. Artificial intelligence-based technologies showed remarkable efficacy to improve the perioperative evaluation of the patient, to assist the decision-making process, to enhance the surgical performance, and to optimize the operating room scheduling. Still, some concern remains about data supply, protection, and transparency, thus further studies and specific consensus guidelines are needed to validate these technologies for daily common practice.\nArtificial intelligence (AI); thoracic surgery; machine learning; lung resection; perioperative medicine.",

    "abstract": "This review will focus on how AI-and, specifically, deep learning-can be applied to complement aspects of the current healthcare system. We describe how AI-based tools can augment existing clinical workflows by discussing the applications of AI to worklist prioritization and patient triage, the performance-boosting effects of AI as a second reader, and the use of AI to facilitate complex quantifications. We also introduce prominent examples of recent AI applications, such as tuberculosis screening in resource-constrained environments, the detection of lung cancer with screening CT, and the diagnosis of COVID-19. We also provide examples of prognostic predictions and new discoveries beyond existing clinical practices.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising performance for thoracic diseases, particularly in the field of thoracic radiology. However, it has not yet been established how AI-based image analysis systems can help physicians in clinical practice.\nThis review included peer-reviewed research articles on AI in the thorax published in English between 2015 and 2021.\nWith advances in technology and appropriate preparation of physicians, AI could address various clinical problems that have not been solved due to a lack of clinical resources or technological limitations.\nArtificial intelligence (AI); deep learning (DL); computer aided diagnosis (CAD); thoracic radiology; pulmonary medicine.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented realities into the medical field is being attempted by various researchers across the globe. As a matter of fact, most of the advanced technologies utilized by medical providers today have been borrowed and extrapolated from other industries. The introduction of AI into the field of hepatology and liver surgery is relatively a recent phenomenon.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder following Alzheimer's disease. Advanced stages of PD, 4 or 5 of the Hoehn and Yahr Scale, are characterized by severe motor complications, limited mobility without assistance, risk of falling, and non-motor complications. The aim of this review was to provide a practical overview on specific artificial intelligence (AI) systems for the management of advanced stages of PD, as well as relevant technological limitations. The authors conducted a systematic search on PubMed and EMBASE with predefined keywords searching for studies published until December 2020. Full articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria were included in the systematic review. To minimize results bias, the reference list was manually searched for pertinent articles to identify any additional relevant missed publications. Exclusion criteria included the following: Other stages of PD than 4 and 5 of the Hoehn and Yahr Scale, case reports, reviews, practice guidelines, commentaries, opinions, letters, editorials, short surveys, articles in press, conference abstracts, conference papers, and abstracts published without a full article. The search identified 21 studies analyzing AI-based applications and robotic systems used for the management of advanced stages of PD, out of which 6 articles analyzed AI-based applications for autonomous management of pharmacologic therapy, 5 articles analyzed home-based telemedicine systems and 10 articles analysed robot-assisted gait training systems. The authors identified significant evidence demonstrating that current AI-based technologies are feasible for automatic management of patients with advanced stages of PD. Improving the quality of care and reducing the cost for patients and healthcare systems are the most important advantages.",

    "abstract": "Craniopharyngioma is a congenital brain tumor with clinical characteristics of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, increased intracranial pressure, and visual field disorder, among other injuries. Its clinical diagnosis mainly depends on radiological examinations (such as Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging). However, assessing numerous radiological images manually is a challenging task, and the experience of doctors has a great influence on the diagnosis result. The development of artificial intelligence has brought about a great transformation in the clinical diagnosis of craniopharyngioma. This study reviewed the application of artificial intelligence technology in the clinical diagnosis of craniopharyngioma from the aspects of differential classification, prediction of tissue invasion and gene mutation, prognosis prediction, and so on. Based on the reviews, the technical route of intelligent diagnosis based on the traditional machine learning model and deep learning model were further proposed. Additionally, in terms of the limitations and possibilities of the development of artificial intelligence in craniopharyngioma diagnosis, this study discussed the attentions required in future research, including few-shot learning, imbalanced data set, semi-supervised models, and multi-omics fusion.",

    "abstract": "Compare with other professions, teachers are reported to have a higher risk of poor mental health. This study examined the relationships between emotional intelligence, perceived organizational justice, and mental health among Chinese high school teachers. Three hundred and eighty-one high school teachers, with their age range between 21 and 50\u2009years, were administered the Emotional Intelligence Scale, Perceived Organizational Justice Scale, and Mental Health Scale. The result found that emotional intelligence and perceived organizational justice directly influence the mental health of high school teachers. In addition, perceived organizational justice mediated the association between emotional intelligence and mental health. Moreover, the present study analyzes the different role of subtypes of perceived organizational justice on the relationships between emotional intelligence and mental health, and the results showed that the mediating effects of perceived distributive justice and interactive justice on emotional intelligence and mental health are not significant, only the perceived procedural justice mediated the relationships between emotional intelligence and teachers' mental health. The results are discussed in a conceptual context.",

    "abstract": "Colonoscopy is an effective screening procedure in colorectal cancer prevention programs; however, colonoscopy practice can vary in terms of lesion detection, classification, and removal. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted decision support systems for endoscopy is an area of rapid research and development. The systems promise improved detection, classification, screening, and surveillance for colorectal polyps and cancer. Several recently developed applications for AI-assisted colonoscopy have shown promising results for the detection and classification of colorectal polyps and adenomas. However, their value for real-time application in clinical practice has yet to be determined owing to limitations in the design, validation, and testing of AI models under real-life clinical conditions. Despite these current limitations, ambitious attempts to expand the technology further by developing more complex systems capable of assisting and supporting the endoscopist throughout the entire colonoscopy examination, including polypectomy procedures, are at the concept stage. However, further work is required to address the barriers and challenges of AI integration into broader colonoscopy practice, to navigate the approval process from regulatory organizations and societies, and to support physicians and patients on their journey to accepting the technology by providing strong evidence of its accuracy and safety. This article takes a closer look at the current state of AI integration into the field of colonoscopy and offers suggestions for future research.",

    "abstract": "A transdisciplinary systems approach to the design of an artificial intelligence (AI) decision support system can more effectively address the limitations of AI systems. By incorporating stakeholder input early in the process, the final product is more likely to improve decision-making and effectively reduce kidney discard.\nKidney discard is a complex problem that will require increased coordination between transplant stakeholders. An AI decision support system has significant potential, but there are challenges associated with overfitting, poor explainability, and inadequate trust. A transdisciplinary approach provides a holistic perspective that incorporates expertise from engineering, social science, and transplant healthcare. A systems approach leverages techniques for visualizing the system architecture to support solution design from multiple perspectives.\nDeveloping a systems-based approach to AI decision support involves engaging in a cycle of documenting the system architecture, identifying pain points, developing prototypes, and validating the system. Early efforts have focused on describing process issues to prioritize tasks that would benefit from AI support.",

    "abstract": "Biliary atresia is an aggressive liver disease of infancy and can cause death without timely surgical intervention. Early diagnosis of biliary atresia is critical to the recovery of bile drainage and long-term transplant-free survival. Ultrasound is recommended as the initial imaging strategy for the diagnosis of biliary atresia. Numerous ultrasound features have been proved helpful for the diagnosis of biliary atresia. In recent years, with the help of new technologies such as elastography ultrasound, contrast-enhanced ultrasound and artificial intelligence, the diagnostic performance of ultrasound has been significantly improved. In this review, various ultrasound features in the diagnosis of biliary atresia are summarized. A diagnostic decision flow chart for biliary atresia is proposed on the basis of the hybrid technologies, combining conventional ultrasound, elastography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound. In addition, the application of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of biliary atresia with ultrasound images is also introduced.",

    "abstract": "Biomarker identification is very important to differentiate the grade groups in the histopathological sections of prostate cancer (PCa). Assessing the cluster of cell nuclei is essential for pathological investigation. In this study, we present a computer-based method for cluster analyses of cell nuclei and performed traditional (i.e., unsupervised method) and modern (i.e., supervised method) artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for distinguishing the grade groups of PCa. Two datasets on PCa were collected to carry out this research. Histopathology samples were obtained from whole slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). In this research, state-of-the-art approaches were proposed for color normalization, cell nuclei segmentation, feature selection, and classification. A traditional minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm was employed to identify the clusters and better capture the proliferation and community structure of cell nuclei. K-medoids clustering and stacked ensemble machine learning (ML) approaches were used to perform traditional and modern AI-based classification. The binary and multiclass classification was derived to compare the model quality and results between the grades of PCa. Furthermore, a comparative analysis was carried out between traditional and modern AI techniques using different performance metrics (i.e., statistical parameters). Cluster features of the cell nuclei can be useful information for cancer grading. However, further validation of cluster analysis is required to accomplish astounding classification results.",

    "abstract": "Semi-quantitative scoring is a method that is widely used to estimate the quantity of proteins on chromogen-labelled immunohistochemical (IHC) tissue sections. However, it suffers from several disadvantages, including its lack of objectivity and the fact that it is a time-consuming process. Our aim was to test a recently established artificial intelligence (AI)-aided digital image analysis platform, Pathronus, and to compare it to conventional scoring by five observers on chromogenic IHC-stained slides belonging to three experimental groups. Because Pathronus operates on grayscale 0-255 values, we transformed the data to a seven-point scale for use by pathologists and scientists. The accuracy of these methods was evaluated by comparing statistical significance among groups with quantitative fluorescent IHC reference data on subsequent tissue sections. The pairwise inter-rater reliability of the scoring and converted Pathronus data varied from poor to moderate with Cohen's kappa, and overall agreement was poor within every experimental group using Fleiss' kappa. Only the original and converted that were obtained from Pathronus original were able to reproduce the statistical significance among the groups that were determined by the reference method. In this study, we present an AI-aided software that can identify cells of interest, differentiate among organelles, protein specific chromogenic labelling, and nuclear counterstaining after an initial training period, providing a feasible and more accurate alternative to semi-quantitative scoring.",

    "abstract": "We performed an electronic database search of published works from 2012 to mid-2021 that focus on human gait studies and apply machine learning techniques. We identified six key applications of machine learning using gait data: 1) Gait analysis where analyzing techniques and certain biomechanical analysis factors are improved by utilizing artificial intelligence algorithms, 2) Health and Wellness, with applications in gait monitoring for abnormal gait detection, recognition of human activities, fall detection and sports performance, 3) Human Pose Tracking using one-person or multi-person tracking and localization systems such as OpenPose, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), etc., 4) Gait-based biometrics with applications in person identification, authentication, and re-identification as well as gender and age recognition 5) \"Smart gait\" applications ranging from smart socks, shoes, and other wearables to smart homes and smart retail stores that incorporate continuous monitoring and control systems and 6) Animation that reconstructs human motion utilizing gait data, simulation and machine learning techniques. Our goal is to provide a single broad-based survey of the applications of machine learning technology in gait analysis and identify future areas of potential study and growth. We discuss the machine learning techniques that have been used with a focus on the tasks they perform, the problems they attempt to solve, and the trade-offs they navigate.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, many studies have been done to identify the factors that affect teacher emotions at schools. However, the empirical evidence on how teachers' emotions influence students' outcomes and performance is not extensive. Against this background, this study explored the correlation between teacher EI and student academic achievement and possible mechanisms may lie in this relationship. A sample of 365 Chinese teachers from 25 public middle schools participated in this study by completing measurements of teacher EI, teacher work engagement, and teacher self-efficacy. The student academic achievement was assessed by the grades of the previous term (February to June 2020) reported by the students. The results indicated that teacher work engagement partially mediated the path from teacher EI and student academic achievement. Moderated mediation further showed that teachers with high self-efficacy had a more significant positive impact on the relationship between teacher work engagement and student academic achievement than teachers with low self-efficacy. The limitations of this study were also discussed.",

    "abstract": "High ideal hybrid intelligence of managers is among the factors that can improve employees' organizational commitment. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the relationship between managers' ideal hybrid intelligence and employees' organizational commitment in the Vice Chancellors' Headquarters of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. This was a descriptive-analytical and cross-sectional study conducted in 2017 - 2018. The research sample size consisted of 86 senior and middle-level managers selected through census method, as well as 181 employees, selected using the Kerjecie and Morgan table. The research tool was an ideal hybrid intelligence questionnaire consisting of 102 questions on cultural, moral and spiritual intelligence, and also Meyer and Allens' organizational commitment questionnaire including 24 questions. Face validity and reliability of each questionnaire were confirmed by an expert panel and Chronbach's alpha method. The data were analyzed by SPSS software, and descriptive results were shown through mean and standard deviation, and analytical results by inferential tests. The results showed that the ideal hybrid intelligence of the Vice Chancellors' Headquarters managers and employees' organizational commitment were at a desirable level. Also, there was a significant correlation between cultural, moral and spiritual intelligence as constituents of the ideal hybrid intelligence of managers and employees' organizational commitment. We found that ideal hybrid intelligence may affect employees' organizational commitment, but it should be mentioned that other forms of intelligence may also affect organizational commitment.",

    "abstract": "The goal of an IVF cycle is a healthy live-born baby. Despite the many advances in the field of assisted reproductive technologies, accurately predicting the outcome of an IVF cycle has yet to be achieved. One reason for this is the method of selecting an embryo for transfer. Morphological assessment of embryos is the traditional method of evaluating embryo quality and selecting which embryo to transfer. However, this subjective method of assessing embryos leads to inter- and intra-observer variability, resulting in less than optimal IVF success rates. To overcome this, it is common practice to transfer more than one embryo, potentially resulting in high-risk multiple pregnancies. Although time-lapse incubators and preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy have been introduced to help increase the chances of live birth, the outcomes remain less than ideal. Utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly popular in the medical field and is increasingly being leveraged in the embryology laboratory to help improve IVF outcomes. Many studies have been published investigating the use of AI as an unbiased, automated approach to embryo assessment. This review summarizes recent AI advancements in the embryology laboratory.",

In the present article, we review the main steps in the history of CRRT, from the discovery of continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration to its evolution into the current treatments and its early use in the treatment of AKI, to the novel sequential extracorporeal therapy. Beyond the technological advances, we describe the development of new medical specialties and a shared nomenclature to support clinicians and researchers in the broad and still evolving field of CRRT.",

    "abstract": "A smart public transport system is expected to be an integral part of our human lives to improve our mobility and reduce the effect of our carbon footprint. The safety and ongoing maintenance of the smart public transport system from cyberattacks are vitally important. To provide more comprehensive protection against potential cyberattacks, we propose a novel approach that combines blockchain technology and a deep learning method that can better protect the smart public transport system. By the creation of signed and verified blockchain blocks and chaining of hashed blocks, the blockchain in our proposal can withstand unauthorized integrity attack that tries to forge sensitive transport maintenance data and transactions associated with it. A hybrid deep learning-based method, which combines autoencoder (AE) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), in our proposal can effectively detect distributed denial of service (DDoS) attempts that can halt or block the urgent and critical exchange of transport maintenance data across the stakeholders. The experimental results of the hybrid deep learning evaluated on three different datasets (i.e., CICDDoS2019, CIC-IDS2017, and BoT-IoT) show that our deep learning model is effective to detect a wide range of DDoS attacks achieving more than 95% ",

    "abstract": "To equip computers with human communication skills and to enable natural interaction between the computer and a human, intelligent solutions are required based on artificial intelligence (AI) methods, algorithms, and sensor technology. This study aimed at identifying and analyzing the state-of-the-art AI methods and algorithms and sensors technology in existing human-computer intelligent interaction (HCII) research to explore trends in HCII research, categorize existing evidence, and identify potential directions for future research. We conduct a systematic mapping study of the HCII body of research. Four hundred fifty-four studies published in various journals and conferences between 2010 and 2021 were identified and analyzed. Studies in the HCII and IUI fields have primarily been focused on intelligent recognition of emotion, gestures, and facial expressions using sensors technology, such as the camera, EEG, Kinect, wearable sensors, eye tracker, gyroscope, and others. Researchers most often apply deep-learning and instance-based AI methods and algorithms. The support sector machine (SVM) is the most widely used algorithm for various kinds of recognition, primarily an emotion, facial expression, and gesture. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is the often-used deep-learning algorithm for emotion recognition, facial recognition, and gesture recognition solutions.",

The article aimed to develop a prediction Multiphysics model for the circular CFST column by using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and the Gene Expression Program (GEP). The database for this study contains 1667 datapoints in which 702 are short CFST columns and 965 are long CFST columns. The input parameters are the geometric dimensions of the structural elements of the column and the mechanical properties of materials. The target parameters are the bearing capacity of columns, which determines their life cycle. A Multiphysics model was developed, and various statistical checks were applied using the three artificial intelligence techniques mentioned above. Parametric and sensitivity analyses were also performed on both short and long GEP models. The overall performance of the GEP model was better than the ANN and ANFIS models, and the prediction values of the GEP model were near actual values. The ",

    "abstract": "Adverse events in COVID-19 are difficult to predict. Risk stratification is encumbered by the need to protect healthcare workers. We hypothesize that artificial intelligence (AI) can help identify subtle signs of myocardial involvement in the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), which could help predict complications.\nUse intake ECGs from COVID-19 patients to train AI models to predict risk of mortality or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).\nWe studied intake ECGs from 1448 COVID-19 patients (60.5% male, aged 63.4 \u00b1 16.9 years). Records were labeled by mortality (death vs discharge) or MACE (no events vs arrhythmic, heart failure [HF], or thromboembolic [TE] events), then used to train AI models; these were compared to conventional regression models developed using demographic and comorbidity data.\nA total of 245 (17.7%) patients died (67.3% male, aged 74.5 \u00b1 14.4 years); 352 (24.4%) experienced at least 1 MACE (119 arrhythmic, 107 HF, 130 TE). AI models predicted mortality and MACE with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.60 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.55 \u00b1 0.07, respectively; these were comparable to AUC values for conventional models (0.73 \u00b1 0.07 and 0.65 \u00b1 0.10). There were no prominent temporal trends in mortality rate or MACE incidence in our cohort; holdout testing with data from after a cutoff date (June 9, 2020) did not degrade model performance.\nUsing intake ECGs alone, our AI models had limited ability to predict hospitalized COVID-19 patients' risk of mortality or MACE. Our models' accuracy was comparable to that of conventional models built using more in-depth information, but translation to clinical use would require higher sensitivity and positive predictive value. In the future, we hope that mixed-input AI models utilizing both ECG and clinical data may be developed to enhance predictive accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The future of radiology is disproportionately linked to the applications of artificial intelligence (AI). Recent exponential advancements in AI are already beginning to augment the clinical practice of radiology. Driven by a paucity of review articles in the area, this article aims to discuss applications of AI in non-oncologic IR across procedural planning, execution, and follow-up along with a discussion on the future directions of the field. Applications in vascular imaging, radiomics, touchless software interactions, robotics, natural language processing, post-procedural outcome prediction, device navigation, and image acquisition are included. Familiarity with AI study analysis will help open the current 'black box' of AI research and help bridge the gap between the research laboratory and clinical practice.",

In addition to an anthropomorphic rhetoric, we can observe the prevalence of a pragmatic line that seeks to be guided, mainly, by the model of corporations, without taking into account, however, problems present in the process of embodiment of companies and the particular function of the term legal person in the grammar of Law.",

    "abstract": "Achieving The United Nations sustainable developments goals by 2030 will be a challenge. Researchers around the world are working toward this aim across the breadth of healthcare. Technology, and more especially artificial intelligence, has the ability to propel us forwards and support these goals but requires careful application. Artificial intelligence shows promise within healthcare and there has been fast development in ophthalmology, cardiology, diabetes, and oncology. Healthcare is starting to learn from commercial industry leaders who utilize fast and continuous testing algorithms to gain efficiency and find the optimum solutions. This article provides examples of how commercial industry is benefitting from utilizing AI and improving service delivery. The article then provides a specific example in eye health on how machine learning algorithms can be purposed to drive service delivery in a resource-limited setting by utilizing the novel study designs in response adaptive randomization. We then aim to provide six key considerations for researchers who wish to begin working with AI technology which include collaboration, adopting a fast-fail culture and developing a capacity in ethics and data science.",

    "abstract": "Pituitary adenomas (PAs) are a group of tumors with complex and heterogeneous clinical manifestations. Early accurate diagnosis, individualized management, and precise prediction of the treatment response and prognosis of patients with PA are urgently needed. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have garnered increasing attention to quantitatively analyze complex medical data to improve individualized care for patients with PAs. Therefore, we critically examined the current use of AI and ML in the management of patients with PAs, and we propose improvements for future uses of AI and ML in patients with PAs. AI and ML can automatically extract many quantitative features based on massive medical data; moreover, related diagnosis and prediction models can be developed through quantitative analysis. Previous studies have suggested that AI and ML have wide applications in early accurate diagnosis; individualized treatment; predicting the response to treatments, including surgery, medications, and radiotherapy; and predicting the outcomes of patients with PAs. In addition, facial imaging-based AI and ML, pathological picture-based AI and ML, and surgical microscopic video-based AI and ML have also been reported to be useful in assisting the management of patients with PAs. In conclusion, the current use of AI and ML models has the potential to assist doctors and patients in making crucial surgical decisions by providing an accurate diagnosis, response to treatment, and prognosis of PAs. These AI and ML models can improve the quality and safety of medical services for patients with PAs and reduce the complication rates of neurosurgery. Further work is needed to obtain more reliable algorithms with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for the management of PA patients.",

    "abstract": "The temporal stability of psychological test scores is one prerequisite for their practical usability. This is especially true for intelligence test scores. In educational contexts, high stakes decisions with long-term consequences, such as placement in special education programs, are often based on intelligence test results. There are four different types of temporal stability: mean-level change, individual-level change, differential continuity, and ipsative continuity. We present statistical methods for investigating each type of stability. Where necessary, the methods were adapted for the specific challenges posed by intelligence research (e.g., controlling for general intelligence in lower order test scores). We provide step-by-step guidance for the application of the statistical methods and apply them to a real data set of 114 gifted students tested twice with a test-retest interval of 6 months. \u2022 Four different types of stability need to be investigated for a full picture of temporal stability in psychological research \u2022 Selection and adaption of the methods for the use in intelligence research \u2022 Complete protocol of the implementation.",

    "abstract": "Since it is fast, inexpensive and increasingly portable, ultrasound can be used for early detection of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) in infants at point-of-care. However, accurate interpretation\\is highly dependent on scan quality. Poor-quality images lead to misdiagnosis, but inexperienced users may not even recognize the deficiencies in the images. Currently, users assess scan quality subjectively, based on image landmarks which are prone to human errors. Instead, we propose using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automatically assess scan quality.\nWe trained separate Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to detect presence of each of four commonly used ultrasound landmarks in each hip image: straight horizontal iliac wing, labrum, os ischium and midportion of the femoral head. We used 100 3D ultrasound (3DUS) images for training and validated the technique on a set of 107 3DUS images also scored for landmarks by three non-expert readers and one expert radiologist.\nWe got AI\u2009\u2265\u200985% accuracy for all four landmarks (ilium\u2009=\u20090.89, labrum\u2009=\u20090.94, os ischium\u2009=\u20090.85, femoral head\u2009=\u20090.98) as a binary classifier between adequate and inadequate scan quality. Our technique also showed excellent agreement with manual assessment in terms of Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient (\nThis new technique could ensure high scan quality and facilitate more widespread use of ultrasound in population screening of DDH.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study is to explore an effective way for providing students with the appropriate learning resources in the remote education scenario. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology and educational psychology theory are applied for designing a personalized online learning resource recommendation scheme to improve students' learning outcomes. First, according to educational psychology, students' learning ability can be obtained by analyzing their learning behaviors. Their identities can be classified into three main groups. Then, features of learning resources such as difficulty degree are extracted, and a LinUCB-based learning resource recommendation algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, a personalized exploration coefficient is carefully constructed according to student's ability and attention scores. It can adaptively adjust the ratio of exploration and exploitation during recommendation. Finally, experiments are conducted for evaluating the superior performance of the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed recommendation scheme can find appropriate learning resources which will match the student's ability and satisfy the student's personalized demands. Meanwhile, by comparing with existing state-of-the-art recommendation schemes, the proposed scheme can achieve accurate recommendations, so as to provide students with the most suitable online learning resources and reduce the risk brought by exploration. Therefore, the proposed scheme can not only control the difficulty degree of learning resources within the student's ability but also encourage their potential by providing suitable learning resources.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology, is a serious threat to the health of middle-aged and elderly people. Although western medicine, traditional medicine such as traditional Chinese medicine, Tibetan medicine and other ethnic medicine have shown certain advantages in the diagnosis and treatment of RA, there are still some practical shortcomings, such as delayed diagnosis, improper treatment scheme and unclear drug mechanism. At present, the applications of artificial intelligence (AI)-based deep learning and cloud computing has aroused wide attention in the medical and health field, especially in screening potential active ingredients, targets and action pathways of single drugs or prescriptions in traditional medicine and optimizing disease diagnosis and treatment models. Integrated information and analysis of RA patients based on AI and medical big data will unquestionably benefit more RA patients worldwide. In this review, we mainly elaborated the application status and prospect of AI-assisted deep learning and cloud computation-oriented western medicine and traditional medicine on the diagnosis and treatment of RA in different stages. It can be predicted that with the help of AI, more pharmacological mechanisms of effective ethnic drugs against RA will be elucidated and more accurate solutions will be provided for the treatment and diagnosis of RA in the future.",

    "abstract": "With the development of telemedicine and edge computing, edge artificial intelligence (AI) will become a new development trend for smart medicine. On the other hand, nearly one-third of children suffer from sleep disorders. However, all existing sleep staging methods are for adults. Therefore, we adapted edge AI to develop a lightweight automatic sleep staging method for children using single-channel EEG. The trained sleep staging model will be deployed to edge smart devices so that the sleep staging can be implemented on edge devices which will greatly save network resources and improving the performance and privacy of sleep staging application. Then the results and hypnogram will be uploaded to the cloud server for further analysis by the physicians to get sleep disease diagnosis reports and treatment opinions. We utilized 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) to build our sleep staging model, named CSleepNet. We tested the model on our childrens sleep (CS) dataset and sleep-EDFX dataset. For the CS dataset, we experimented with F4-M1 channel EEG using four different loss functions, and the logcosh performed best with overall accuracy of 83.06% and F1-score of 76.50%. We used Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz channel EEG to train our model in Sleep-EDFX dataset, and achieved an accuracy of 86.41% without manual feature extraction. The experimental results show that our method has great potential. It not only plays an important role in sleep-related research, but also can be widely used in the classification of other time sequences physiological signals.",

    "abstract": "Business competition is getting more intense nowadays, and corporate survival is getting harder; consequently, corporate managers have to make financial decisions in complex and globalized scenarios. As a result, in order to compete in today's global economy, businesses are contemplating incorporating behavioural components of human psychology into their decision-making processes. Corporations are masters of quantitative analysis, but they rarely pay attention to behavioural elements of organizational success. Emotional intelligence is important in many parts of life; therefore, it is crucial to look at its dimensions when it comes to corporate financial decision-making.\nA simple random sampling technique was used to collect data from 200 senior-level managers from the corporate sector located in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad of Pakistan. SPSS version 22 was used to test the hypotheses.\nResults of the study show the gender-based variation in corporate financial decision-making detailing the higher impact of EI of males on CFD than their counterparts in the corporate sector organizations. The elements of self-awareness, empathy, motivation and self-regulation affect the financial decision-making of both the genders with varying degrees of influence, whereas social skills do not affect CFD of both genders.\nThe study findings explicate that the influence of self-awareness and empathy constructs of EI on corporate financial decisions is stronger in female managers than their male counterparts. However, male managers exhibit a significantly stronger influence of motivation, social skills, and self-regulation dimensions on their financial decisions compared to female managers in a corporate setting. Overall, the impact of EI on CFD is slightly higher in male managers. These empirical outcomes imply that organizations should assess the employees not only for technical skills but also based on their emotional intelligence during the recruitment process.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurodegeneration and has a prediagnostic phase with a lot of challenges to identify clinical and laboratory biomarkers for those in the earliest stages or those 'at risk'. Despite the current research effort, further progress in this field hinges on the more effective application of digital biomarker and artificial intelligence applications at the prediagnostic stages of PD. It is of the highest importance to stratify such prediagnostic subjects that seem to have the most neuroprotective benefit from drugs. However, current initiatives to identify individuals at risk or in the earliest stages that might be candidates for future clinical trials are still challenging due to the limited accuracy and explainability of existing prediagnostic detection and progression prediction solutions. In this brief paper, we report on a novel digital neuro signature (DNS) for prodromal-PD based on selected digital biomarkers previously discovered on preclinical Alzheimer's disease. (AD). Our preliminary results demonstrated a standard DNS signature for both preclinical AD and prodromal PD, containing a ranked selection of features. This novel DNS signature was rapidly repurposed out of 793 digital biomarker features and selected the top 20 digital biomarkers that are predictive and could detect both the biological signature of preclinical AD and the biological mechanism of a-synucleinopathy in prodromal PD. The resulting model can provide physicians with a pool of patients potentially eligible for therapy and comes along with information about the importance of the digital biomarkers that are predictive, based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Similar initiatives could clarify the stage before and around diagnosis, enabling the field to push into unchartered territory at the earliest stages of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Most national health-care systems approve new drugs based on data of safety and efficacy from large randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Strict selection biases and study-entry criteria of subjects included in RCTs often do not reflect those of the population where a therapy is intended to be used. Compliance to treatment in RCTs also differs considerably from real world settings and the relatively small size of most RCTs make them unlikely to detect rare but important safety signals. These and other considerations may explain the gap between evidence generated in RCTs and translating conclusions to health-care policies in the real world. Real-world evidence (RWE) derived from real-world data (RWD) is receiving increasing attention from scientists, clinicians, and health-care policy decision-makers - especially when it is processed by artificial intelligence (AI). We describe the potential of using RWD and AI in Hematology to support research and health-care decisions.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death. Early intervention is the key to reduce HF-related morbidity and mortality. This study assesses the utility of electrocardiograms (ECGs) in HF risk prediction.\nData from the baseline visits (1987-89) of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study was used. Incident hospitalized HF events were ascertained by ICD codes. Participants with good quality baseline ECGs were included. Participants with prevalent HF were excluded. ECG-artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict HF was created as a deep residual convolutional neural network (CNN) utilizing standard 12-lead ECG. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate prediction models including (CNN), light gradient boosting machines (LGBM), and Cox proportional hazards regression. A total of 14\u2009613 (45% male, 73% of white, mean age \u00b1 standard deviation of 54\u2009\u00b1\u20095) participants were eligible. A total of 803 (5.5%) participants developed HF within 10 years from baseline. Convolutional neural network utilizing solely ECG achieved an AUC of 0.756 (0.717-0.795) on the hold-out test data. ARIC and Framingham Heart Study (FHS) HF risk calculators yielded AUC of 0.802 (0.750-0.850) and 0.780 (0.740-0.830). The highest AUC of 0.818 (0.778-0.859) was obtained when ECG-AI model output, age, gender, race, body mass index, smoking status, prevalent coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate were used as predictors of HF within LGBM. The ECG-AI model output was the most important predictor of HF.\nECG-AI model based solely on information extracted from ECG independently predicts HF with accuracy comparable to existing FHS and ARIC risk calculators.",

    "abstract": "In order to improve software quality and testing efficiency, this paper implements the prediction of software defects based on deep learning. According to the respective advantages and disadvantages of the particle swarm algorithm and the wolf swarm algorithm, the two algorithms are mixed to realize the complementary advantages of the algorithms. At the same time, the hybrid algorithm is used in the search of model hyperparameter optimization, the loss function of the model is used as the fitness function, and the collaborative search ability of the swarm intelligence population is used to find the global optimal solution in multiple local solution spaces. Through the analysis of the experimental results of six data sets, compared with the traditional hyperparameter optimization method and a single swarm intelligence algorithm, the model using the hybrid algorithm has higher and better indicators. And, under the processing of the autoencoder, the performance of the model has been further improved.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is used to solve the problem of missed diagnosis of polyps in colonoscopy, which has been proved to improve the detection rate of adenomas. The aim of this review was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of AI-assisted detection and classification of polyps in colonoscopy.\nThe literature search was undertaken on 4 electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library). The inclusion criteria were as follows: studies reporting AI-assisted detection and classification of polyps; studies containing patients, images, or videos receiving AI-assisted diagnosis; studies which included AI-assisted diagnosis and reported classification based on histopathology; and studies providing accurate diagnostic data. Non-English language studies, case-reports, reviews, meeting abstracts and so on were excluded. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 scale was used to evaluate the quality of literature and the Stata 13.0 software was used to perform meta-analysis.\nTwenty-six articles were included with all of medium quality. Meta-analysis showed none of literature had any obvious publication bias. The application of AI in detection of colorectal polyps achieved a sensitivity of 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89-0.98] and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.79-0.82). In the AI-assisted classification, the sensitivity was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.95) with a specificity of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.71-0.89) and an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.92-0.96). For the classification of diminutive polyps, the AI-assisted technique yielded a sensitivity of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.94-0.97), a specificity of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.74-0.95), and an AUC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95-0.98). For AI-assisted classification under magnifying endoscopy, the sensitivity was 0.954 (95% CI: 0.92-0.96) with a specificity of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.80-0.99) and an AUC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95-0.98).\nThe AI-assisted technique demonstrates impressive accuracy for the detection and characterization of colorectal polyps and can be expected to be a novel auxiliary diagnosis method. Our study has inevitable limitations including heterogeneity due to different AI systems and the inability to further analyze the specificity and sensitivity of AI for different types of endoscopes.",

    "abstract": "The present study created an artificial intelligence (AI)-automated diagnostics system for uterine cervical lesions and assessed the performance of these images for AI diagnostic imaging of pathological cervical lesions. A total of 463 colposcopic images were analyzed. The traditional colposcopy diagnoses were compared to those obtained by AI image diagnosis. Next, 100 images were presented to a panel of 32 gynecologists who independently examined each image in a blinded fashion and diagnosed them for four categories of tumors. Then, the 32 gynecologists revisited their diagnosis for each image after being informed of the AI diagnosis. The present study assessed any changes in physician diagnosis and the accuracy of AI-image-assisted diagnosis (AISD). The accuracy of AI was 57.8% for normal, 35.4% for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)1, 40.5% for CIN2-3 and 44.2% for invasive cancer. The accuracy of gynecologist diagnoses from cervical pathological images, before knowing the AI image diagnosis, was 54.4% for CIN2-3 and 38.9% for invasive cancer. After learning of the AISD, their accuracy improved to 58.0% for CIN2-3 and 48.5% for invasive cancer. AI-assisted image diagnosis was able to improve gynecologist diagnosis accuracy significantly (P<0.01) for invasive cancer and tended to improve their accuracy for CIN2-3 (P=0.14).",

    "abstract": "The global prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) continues to rise. Non-invasive diagnostic modalities including ultrasonography and clinical scoring systems have been proposed as alternatives to liver biopsy but with limited performance. Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being integrated with conventional diagnostic methods in the hopes of performance improvements. We aimed to estimate the performance of AI-assisted systems for diagnosing NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and liver fibrosis.\nA systematic review was performed to identify studies integrating AI in the diagnosis of NAFLD, NASH, and liver fibrosis. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and summary receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated.\nTwenty-five studies were included in the systematic review. Meta-analysis of 13 studies showed that AI significantly improved the diagnosis of NAFLD, NASH and liver fibrosis. AI-assisted ultrasonography had excellent performance for diagnosing NAFLD, with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV of 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91-0.99), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.89-1.00), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93-1.00), and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.88-0.98), respectively. The performance of AI-assisted ultrasonography was better than AI-assisted clinical data sets for the identification of NAFLD, which provided a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.66-0.82), 0.82 (95% CI: 0.74-0.88), 0.75 (95% CI: 0.60-0.86), and 0.82 (0.74-0.87), respectively. The area under the curves were 0.98 and 0.85 for AI-assisted ultrasonography and AI-assisted clinical data sets, respectively. AI-integrated clinical data sets had a pooled sensitivity, specificity of 0.80 (95%CI: 0.75-0.85), 0.69 (95%CI: 0.53-0.82) for identifying NASH, as well as 0.99-1.00 and 0.76-1.00 for diagnosing liver fibrosis stage F1-F4, respectively.\nAI-supported systems provide promising performance improvements for diagnosing NAFLD, NASH, and identifying liver fibrosis among NAFLD patients. Prospective trials with direct comparisons between AI-assisted modalities and conventional methods are warranted before real-world implementation.\nPROSPERO (CRD42021230391).",

    "abstract": "Pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD) appears to be a heterogeneous group of conditions, but this heterogeneity has not been explored with respect to its impact on neurocognitive functioning. This study investigated the neurocognitive functioning of those with glomerular (G) vs. non-glomerular (NG) diagnoses. Data from the North American CKiD Study were employed and the current study included 1,003 children and adolescents with mild to moderate CKD. The G Group included 260 participants (median age = 14.7 years) and the NG Group included 743 individuals (median age = 9.0 years). Neurocognitive measures assessed IQ, inhibitory control, attention regulation, problem solving, working memory, and overall executive functioning. Data from all visits were included in the linear mixed model analyses. After adjusting for sociodemographic and CKD-related covariates, results indicated no differences between the diagnostic groups on measures of IQ, problem solving, working memory, and attention regulation. There was a trend for the G group to receive better parent ratings on their overall executive functions (",

    "abstract": "Objective To establish an artificial intelligence model based on B-mode thyroid ultrasound images to predict central compartment lymph node metastasis(CLNM)in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma(PTC). Methods We retrieved the clinical manifestations and ultrasound images of the tumors in 309 patients with surgical histologically confirmed PTC and treated in the First Medical Center of PLA General Hospital from January to December in 2018.The datasets were split into the training set and the test set.We established a deep learning-based computer-aided model for the diagnosis of CLNM in patients with PTC and then evaluated the diagnosis performance of this model with the test set. Result The accuracy,sensitivity,specificity,and area under receiver operating characteristic curve of our model for predicting CLNM were 80%,76%,83%,and 0.794,respectively. Conclusion Deep learning-based radiomics can be applied in predicting CLNM in patients with PTC and provide a basis for therapeutic regimen selection in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "There have been a number of reports about the transcriptional regulatory networks in schizophrenia. However, most of these studies were based on a specific transcription factor or a single dataset, an approach that is inadequate to understand the diverse etiology and underlying common characteristics of schizophrenia. Here we reconstructed and compared the transcriptional regulatory network for lipid metabolism enzymes using 15 public transcriptome datasets of neural cells from schizophrenia patients. Since many of the well-known schizophrenia-related SNPs are in enhancers, we reconstructed a network including enhancer-dependent regulation and found that 53.3 % of the total number of edges (7,577 pairs) involved regulation via enhancers. By examining multiple datasets, we found common and unique transcriptional modes of regulation. Furthermore, enrichment analysis of SNPs that were connected with genes in the transcriptional regulatory networks by eQTL suggested an association with hematological cell counts and some other traits/diseases, whose relationship to schizophrenia was either not or insufficiently reported in previous studies. Based on these results, we suggest that in future studies on schizophrenia, information on genotype, comorbidities and hematological cell counts should be included, along with the transcriptome, for a more detailed genetic stratification and mechanistic exploration of schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "To develop and internally validate a machine-learning algorithm to reliably predict cost after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).\nA retrospective review of the New York State Ambulatory Surgery and Services database was performed to identify patients who underwent elective ACLR from 2015 to 2016. Features included in initial models consisted of patient characteristics (age, sex, insurance status, income, medical comorbidities as classified by the Clinical Classifications Software diagnosis code) as well as intraoperative variables (type of anesthesia and procedure-specific factors). Models were generated to predict total charges using 4 algorithms: random forest, extreme gradient boost, elastic net penalized regression, and support vector machines with radial kernels. Training was performed with 10-fold cross-validation followed by internal validation via 0.632 bootstrapping. Model discriminative performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration, and the Brier score. Decision curve analysis was performed to demonstrate the net benefit of using the final model in practice.\nIn total, 7,311 patients undergoing ambulatory ACLR were included. The random forest model demonstrated the best performance assessed via internal validation (area under the curve\u00a0= 0.85), calibration, and the Brier score (0.208). Cost incurred was influenced by anesthesia type, operating room time, and number of chronic comorbidities. Decision curve analysis revealed a net benefit for use of the random forest model and the model was integrated into a web-based open-access application.\nThe random forest model predicted cost after ambulatory ACLR using a large, statewide database with good performance. The top variables found to predict increased charges were general anesthesia, operating room time, meniscal repair, self-pay insurance, patient neighborhood characteristics, and number of chronic conditions.\nIII, retrospective cohort study.",

    "abstract": "Human emotions affect psychological health to a great level. Positive emotions relate to health improvement; whereas negative emotions may aggravate psychological disorders such as anxiety, stress, and depression. Although there exist several computational methods to predict psychological disorders, most of them provide a black-box view of uncertainty. This research involves developing a novel predictive model for multi class psychological risk recognition with an accurate explainable interface. Standard questionnaires are utilized as data set and a new approach called a Q-Prioritization is employed to drop insignificant questions from the data set. Moreover, a novel balanced decision tree method based on repetitive oversampling is applied for the training and testing of the model. Predictive nature along with its contributing factors are interpreted with three techniques such as permuted feature importance, contrastive explanation, and counterfactual method, which together form a reasoning engine. The prediction outcome generated an impressive performance with an aggregated accuracy of 98.25%. The mean precision, recall, and F-score metric recorded were 0.98, 0.977, and 0.979, respectively. Also, it was noted that without applying Q-Prioritization, the accuracy significantly drops to 90.25%. The error rate observed with our model was only 0.026. The proposed multi-level psychological disorder predictive model can successfully serve as an assistive deployment for medical experts in the effective treatment of mental health.",

    "abstract": "Chest radiographs (X-rays) combined with Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods have been demonstrated to detect and diagnose the onset of COVID-19, the disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, questions remain regarding the accuracy of those methods as they are often challenged by limited datasets, performance legitimacy on imbalanced data, and have their results typically reported without proper confidence intervals. Considering the opportunity to address these issues, in this study, we propose and test six modified deep learning models, including VGG16, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, ResNet101, and VGG19 to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection from chest X-ray images. Results are evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f- score using a small and balanced dataset (Study One), and a larger and imbalanced dataset (Study Two). With 95% confidence interval, VGG16 and MobileNetV2 show that, on both datasets, the model could identify patients with COVID-19 symptoms with an accuracy of up to 100%. We also present a pilot test of VGG16 models on a multi-class dataset, showing promising results by achieving 91% accuracy in detecting COVID-19, normal, and Pneumonia patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that poorly performing models in Study One (ResNet50 and ResNet101) had their accuracy rise from 70% to 93% once trained with the comparatively larger dataset of Study Two. Still, models like InceptionResNetV2 and VGG19's demonstrated an accuracy of 97% on both datasets, which posits the effectiveness of our proposed methods, ultimately presenting a reasonable and accessible alternative to identify patients with COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "During the past two decades, many remote sensing image fusion techniques have been designed to improve the spatial resolution of the low-spatial-resolution multispectral bands. The main objective is fuse the low-resolution multispectral (MS) image and the high-spatial-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image to obtain a fused image having high spatial and spectral information. Recently, many artificial intelligence-based deep learning models have been designed to fuse the remote sensing images. But these models do not consider the inherent image distribution difference between MS and PAN images. Therefore, the obtained fused images may suffer from gradient and color distortion problems. To overcome these problems, in this paper, an efficient artificial intelligence-based deep transfer learning model is proposed. Inception-ResNet-v2 model is improved by using a color-aware perceptual loss (CPL). The obtained fused images are further improved by using gradient channel prior as a postprocessing step. Gradient channel prior is used to preserve the color and gradient information. Extensive experiments are carried out by considering the benchmark datasets. Performance analysis shows that the proposed model can efficiently preserve color and gradient information in the fused remote sensing images than the existing models.",

    "abstract": "The first step to exercise is preceded by the required assumption of the upright body position, which itself involves physical activity. The gravitational displacement of blood from the chest to the lower parts of the body elicits a fall in central blood volume (CBV), which corresponds to the fraction of thoracic blood volume directly available to the left ventricle. The reduction in CBV and stroke volume (SV) in response to postural stress, post-exercise, or to blood loss results in reduced left ventricular filling, which may manifest as orthostatic intolerance. When termination of exercise removes the leg muscle pump function, CBV is no longer maintained. The resulting imbalance between a reduced cardiac output (CO) and a still enhanced peripheral vascular conductance may provoke post-exercise hypotension (PEH). Instruments that quantify CBV are not readily available and to express which magnitude of the CBV in a healthy subject should remains difficult. In the physiological laboratory, the CBV can be modified by making use of postural stressors, such as lower body \"negative\" or sub-atmospheric pressure (LBNP) or passive head-up tilt (HUT), while quantifying relevant biomedical parameters of blood flow and oxygenation. Several approaches, such as wearable sensors and advanced machine-learning techniques, have been followed in an attempt to improve methodologies for better prediction of outcomes and to guide treatment in civil patients and on the battlefield. In the recent decade, efforts have been made to develop algorithms and apply artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of hemodynamic monitoring. Advances in quantifying and monitoring CBV during environmental stress from exercise to hemorrhage and understanding the analogy between postural stress and central hypovolemia during anesthesia offer great relevance for healthy subjects and clinical populations.",

    "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is initiated by traumatic-stress exposure and manifests into a collection of symptoms including increased anxiety, sleep disturbances, enhanced response to triggers, and increased sympathetic nervous system arousal. PTSD is highly co-occurring with alcohol use disorder. Only some individuals experiencing traumatic stress develop PTSD and a subset of individuals with PTSD develop co-occurring alcohol use disorder. To investigate the basis of these individual responses to traumatic stress, single prolonged stress (SPS) a rodent model of traumatic stress was applied to young adult female rats. Individual responses to SPS were characterized by measuring anxiety-like behaviors with open field and elevated plus maze tests. Rats were then allowed to drink ethanol under an intermittent two bottle choice procedure for 8 weeks, and ethanol consumption was measured. An artificial intelligence algorithm was built to predict resilient and vulnerable individuals based on data from anxiety testing and ethanol consumption. This model was implemented in a second cohort of rats that underwent SPS without ethanol drinking to identify resilient and vulnerable individuals for further study. Analysis of neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels and expression of its receptors Y1R and Y2R mRNA in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and bed nucleus stria terminalis (BNST) were performed. Results demonstrate that resilient rats had higher expression of Y2R mRNA in the CeA compared with vulnerable and control rats and had higher levels of NPY protein in the BNST compared to controls. The results of the study show that an artificial intelligence algorithm can identify individual differences in response to traumatic stress which can be used to predict subsequent ethanol drinking, and the NPY pathway is differentially altered following traumatic stress exposure in resilient and vulnerable populations. Understanding neurochemical alterations following traumatic-stress exposure is critical in developing prevention strategies for the vulnerable phenotype and will help further development of novel therapeutic approaches for individuals suffering from PTSD and at risk for alcohol use disorder.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has found its way into every sphere of human life including the field of medicine. Detection of cancer might be AI's most altruistic and convoluted challenge to date in the field of medicine. Embedding AI into various aspects of cancer diagnostics would be of immense use in dealing with the tedious, repetitive, time-consuming job of lesion detection, remove opportunities for human error, and cut costs and time. This would be of great value in cancer screening programs. By using AI algorithms, data from digital images from radiology and pathology that are imperceptible to the human eye can be identified (radiomics and pathomics). Correlating radiomics and pathomics with clinico-demographic-therapy-morbidity-mortality profiles will lead to a greater understanding of cancers. Specific imaging phenotypes have been found to be associated with specific gene-determined molecular pathways involved in cancer pathogenesis (radiogenomics). All these developments would not only help to personalize oncologic practice but also lead to the development of new imaging biomarkers. AI algorithms in oncoimaging and oncopathology will broadly have the following uses: cancer screening (detection of lesions), characterization and grading of tumors, and clinical decision-making and prognostication. However, AI cannot be a foolproof panacea nor can it supplant the role of humans. It can however be a powerful and useful complement to human insights and deeper understanding. Multiple issues like standardization, validity, ethics, privacy, finances, legal liability, training, accreditation, etc., need to be overcome before the vast potential of AI in diagnostic oncology can be fully harnessed.",

    "abstract": "The quality of EGD is a prerequisite for a high detection rate of upper GI lesions, especially early gastric cancer. Our previous study showed that an artificial intelligence system, named intelligent detection endoscopic assistant (IDEA), could help to monitor blind spots and provide an operation score during EGD. Here, we verified the effectiveness of IDEA to help evaluate the quality of EGD in a large-scale multicenter trial.\nPatients undergoing EGD in 12 hospitals were consecutively enrolled. All hospitals were equipped with IDEA developed using deep convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory. Patients were examined by EGD, and the results were recorded by IDEA. The primary outcome was the detection rate of upper GI cancer. Secondary outcomes were part scores, total scores, and endoscopic procedure time, which were analyzed by IDEA.\nA total of 17,787 patients were recruited. The total detection rate of cancer-positive cases was 1.50%, ranging\u00a0from .60% to 3.94% in each hospital. The total detection rate of early cancer-positive cases was .36%, ranging from .00% to 1.58% in each hospital. The average total score analyzed by IDEA ranged from 64.87 \u00b1 16.87 to 83.50 \u00b1\u00a09.57 in each hospital. The cancer detection rate in each hospital was positively correlated with total score (r\u00a0= .775, P\u00a0= .003). Similarly, the early cancer detection rate was positively correlated with total score (r\u00a0= .756, P\u00a0= .004).\nThis multicenter trial confirmed that the quality of the EGD result is positively correlated with the detection rate of cancer, which can be monitored by IDEA.

    "abstract": "The validity and reliability of the psychological assessment of auditory perceptions, as typified by the grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, and strain (GRBAS) scale, have been widely recognized. However, due to their subjective nature, inter- and intra-examiner reliability are unavoidable. In this study, we aimed to add objectivity to the GRBAS scale using artificial intelligence and to compare the accuracy of two methods-one based on Google's TensorFlow and another based on Apple's Core ML.\nThe GRBAS scale of 1,377 vowel samples was evaluated and used as training data to create a machine learning model. We used TensorFlow and Apple's Create ML to create two machine learning models and examined the difference in their accuracies for classifying the severity of pathological Voice data based on the GRBAS scale.\nAbsolute comparisons are difficult to make because of the difference in methods; however, both training models could objectively evaluate GRBAS scales and were statistically correlated in G and B.\nWhile TensorFlow requires creation of a training model from scratch, Create ML is a relatively easy way to create a training model for voice by adding training data for GRBAS scales to an existing training model for sounds. Although the data handling and learning methods are different, both models performed well. Findings from this study could be used for medical screening purposes, and there is the potential to change the clinical approach to voice diagnostics in the future.",

    "abstract": "The effect of emotional intelligence in the field of mental health is of particular interest, as it is an intensely emotional field. The nursing staff has as an object the healthcare of people with mental problems, where emotions and their management are key factors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the levels of emotional intelligence and caring behaviors among mental health nurses as well as the correlation between these variables. In this cross-sectional study, 191 nurses completed the tools Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form (TEIQue-SF) and the Caring Behaviors Inventory-24 scale (CBI-24) for assessing the degree of emotional intelligence and caring behaviors, respectively. Demographic and job characteristics were recorded. Results: The results showed that the majority of participants were female and the average age was 44.69\u00a0years. According to the total but also the individual scoring of the TEIQue-SF, emotional intelligence was found to be at a relatively high level (total mean: 4.92) and was associated directly (r\u00a0=\u00a00.448, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) with the frequency of caring behaviors of the CBI-24 which was found to be at a fairly high level (total mean 5.08). The study findings showed that as the overall emotional intelligence increased, the frequency of occurrence and the importance of behavioral behaviors increased.",

    "abstract": "Social and health care equity and justice should be prioritized by the mantra of medicine, first do no harm. Despite highly motivated national and global health strategies, there remains significant health care inequity. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including a number of biases, are key drivers of ongoing health inequity including equity of access and opportunity for nuclear medicine and radiology services. There is a substantial gap in the global practice of nuclear medicine in particular, but also radiology, between developed health economies and those considered developing or undeveloped. At a local level, even in developed health economies, there can be a significant disparity between health services, including medical imaging, between communities based on socioeconomic, cultural or geographic differences. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to either widen the health inequity divide or substantially reduce it. Distributed generally, AI technology could be used to overcome geographic boundaries to health care, thus bringing general and specialist care into underserved communities. However, should AI technology be limited to localities already enjoying ample healthcare access and direct access to health infrastructure, like radiology and nuclear medicine, it could then accentuate the gap. There are a number of challenges across the AI pipeline that need careful attention to ensure beneficence over maleficence. Fully realized, AI augmented health care could be crafted as an integral part of the broader strategy convergence on local, national and global health equity. The applications of AI in nuclear medicine and radiology could emerge as a powerful tool in social and health equity.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops an artificial intelligence based automated valuation model (AI-AVM) using the boosting tree ensemble technique to predict housing prices in Singapore. We use more than 300,000 private and public housing transactions in Singapore for the period from 1995 to 2017 in the training of the AI-AVM models. The boosting model is the best predictive model that produce the most robust and accurate predictions for housing prices compared to the decision tree and multiple regression analysis (MRA) models. The boosting AI-AVM models explain 91.33% and 94.28% of the price variances, and keep the mean absolute percentage errors at 8.55% and 5.34% for the public housing market and the private housing market, respectively. When subject the AI-AVM to the out-of-sample forecasting using the 2018 housing sale samples, the prediction errors remain within a narrow range of between 5% and 9%.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a technology at the center of many political, economic, and societal debates. This paper formulates a new AI patent search strategy and applies this to provide a landscape analysis of AI innovation dynamics and technology evolution. The paper uses patent analyses, network analyses, and source path link count algorithms to examine AI spatial and temporal trends, cooperation features, cross-organization knowledge flow and technological routes. Results indicate a growing yet concentrated, non-collaborative and multi-path development and protection profile for AI patenting, with cross-organization knowledge flows based mainly on interorganizational knowledge citation links.",

    "abstract": "We introduce and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-accelerated multi-shot echo-planar imaging (msEPI)-based method that provides T1w, T2w, \nThe rapid imaging technique combines a novel machine learning (ML) scheme to limit g-factor noise amplification and improve SNR, a magnetization transfer preparation module to provide clinically desirable contrast, and high per-shot EPI undersampling factors to reduce distortion. The ML training and image reconstruction incorporates a tunable parameter for controlling the level of denoising/smoothness. The performance of the reconstruction method is evaluated across various acceleration factors, contrasts, and SNR conditions. The 2-minute protocol is directly compared to a 10-minute clinical reference protocol through deployment in a clinical setting, where five representative cases with pathology are examined.\nOptimization of custom msEPI sequences and protocols was performed to balance acquisition efficiency and image quality compared to the five-fold longer clinical reference. Training data from 16 healthy subjects across multiple contrasts and orientations were used to produce ML networks at various acceleration levels. The flexibility of the ML reconstruction was demonstrated across SNR levels, and an optimized regularization was determined through radiological review. Network generalization toward novel pathology, unobserved during training, was illustrated in five clinical case studies with clinical reference images provided for comparison.\nThe rapid 2-minute msEPI-based protocol with tunable ML reconstruction allows for advantageous trade-offs between acquisition speed, SNR, and tissue contrast when compared to the five-fold slower standard clinical reference exam.",

An AI algorithm (RetinaNet) was trained to analyze and detect TPF on the X-rays. The ability of the AI algorithm was determined by indexes such as detection accuracy and time taken for analysis. The algorithm performance was also compared with orthopedic physicians.\nThe AI algorithm showed a detection accuracy of 0.91 for the identification of TPF, which was similar to the performance of orthopedic physicians (0.92\u00b10.03). The average time spent for analysis of the AI was 0.56 s, which was 16 times faster than human performance (8.44\u00b13.26 s).\nThe AI algorithm is a valid and efficient method for the clinical diagnosis of TPF.

    "abstract": "Approximately 7%-50% of children with medulloblastoma (MB) develop postoperative cerebellar mutism syndrome (pCMS). pCMS has a short-term negative impact on intelligence, but effects on long-term outcomes are contradictory. The aim of this study was to assess long-term effects of pCMS in MB patients on aspects of intelligence quotient (IQ) and its perioperative risk factors.\nIn this single-center retrospective cohort study, 31 children were included (14 pCMS). Perioperative risk factors included brainstem invasion, vermis incision, hydrocephalus, tumor size, severity of pCMS, neurological symptoms, mean body temperature (BT) on days 1-4 post surgery, and age at resection. Age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence tests were assessed at least 2\u00a0years after tumor resection.\nMean interval between tumor resection and neuropsychological evaluation was 3.9\u00a0years in pCMS and 4\u00a0years and 11\u00a0months in the no-pCMS group. No significant differences in IQ scores were found between groups. The pCMS group had a clinically relevant difference of 10 points when compared to age norms on verbal IQ (VIQ). Bilateral pyramidal and swallowing problems were risk factors for lower performance. In the overall group, tumor size, younger age at surgery, and raised mean BT were negatively correlated with aspects of IQ.\nWe found a clinically significant reduction of VIQ in the pCMS patient group. pCMS patients with a larger tumor size, younger age at surgery, a higher mean BT in the first days after surgery, bilateral pyramidal symptoms, and swallowing problems 10\u00a0days post surgery are more at risk for VIQ deficits at long-term.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, researchers have applied it to the diagnosis of various tumors in the urinary system in recent years, and have obtained many valuable research results. The article sorted the research status of artificial intelligence technology in the fields of renal tumors, bladder tumors and prostate tumors from three aspects: the number of papers, image data, and clinical tasks. The purpose is to summarize and analyze the research status and find new valuable research ideas in the future. The results show that the artificial intelligence model based on medical data such as digital imaging and pathological images is effective in completing basic diagnosis of urinary system tumors, image segmentation of tumor infiltration areas or specific organs, gene mutation prediction and prognostic effect prediction, but most of the models for the requirement of clinical application still need to be improved. On the one hand, it is necessary to further improve the detection, classification, segmentation and other performance of the core algorithm. On the other hand, it is necessary to integrate more standardized medical databases to effectively improve the diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence models and make it play greater clinical value.\n\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u76ee\u524d\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u6ccc\u5c3f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5404\u7c7b\u80bf\u7624\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u5bf9\u8fd1\u5e74\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u5728\u80be\u810f\u80bf\u7624\u3001\u8180\u80f1\u80bf\u7624\u3001\u524d\u5217\u817a\u80bf\u7624\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u72b6\u51b5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6574\u7406\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u603b\u7ed3\u548c\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u601d\u8def\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5f71\u50cf\u3001\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u7b49\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u6ccc\u5c3f\u7cfb\u7edf\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u80bf\u7624\u6d78\u6da6\u533a\u57df\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u5668\u5b98\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u7a81\u53d8\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u9884\u540e\u6548\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u533b\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6838\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5206\u5272\u7b49\u6548\u80fd\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u66f4\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e4b\u53d1\u6325\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u4ef7\u503c\u3002.",

    "abstract": "Aiming at the limitations of clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, an intelligent-aided diagnosis method based on few-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) and time-frequency deep network is proposed for PD with RBD. Firstly, in order to improve the speed of the operation and robustness of the algorithm, the 6-channel scalp EEG of each subject were segmented with the same time-window. Secondly, the model of time-frequency deep network was constructed and trained with time-window EEG data to obtain the segmentation-based classification result. Finally, the output of time-frequency deep network was postprocessed to obtain the subject-based diagnosis result. Polysomnography (PSG) of 60 patients, including 30 idiopathic PD and 30 PD with RBD, were collected by Nanjing Brain Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University and the doctor's detection results of PSG were taken as the gold standard in our study. The accuracy of the segmentation-based classification was 0.902 4 in the validation set. The accuracy of the subject-based classification was 0.933 3 in the test set. Compared with the RBD screening questionnaire (RBDSQ), the novel approach has clinical application value.\n\u9488\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\uff08PD\uff09\u4f34\u5feb\u901f\u773c\u52a8\u7761\u7720\u884c\u4e3a\u969c\u788d\uff08RBD\uff09\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c11\u5bfc\u8054\u8111\u7535\u548c\u65f6\u9891\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd0\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u53ca\u7b97\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u5404\u88ab\u8bd5\u8005\u76846\u5bfc\u8054\u5934\u76ae\u8111\u7535\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7b49\u957f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u63d0\u53d6\uff1b\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u8111\u7535\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u9891\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5bf9\u5404\u88ab\u8bd5\u8005\u6240\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u8111\u7535\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u88ab\u8bd5\u8005\u7684PD\u4f34RBD\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ee5\u5357\u4eac\u533b\u79d1\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u5c5e\u8111\u79d1\u533b\u9662\u91c7\u96c6\u7684PD\u4f34\u548c\u4e0d\u4f34RBD\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u591a\u5bfc\u7761\u7720\u56fe\uff08PSG\uff09\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4e24\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u540430\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u533b\u751f\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a0.902 4\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u88ab\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a0.933 3\uff0c\u6bd4RBD\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b5b\u67e5\u95ee\u5377\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d ",

    "abstract": "Diagnostic tests that detect antibodies (AB) against SARS-CoV-2 for evaluation of seroprevalence and guidance of health care measures are important tools for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Current tests have certain limitations with regard to turnaround time, costs and availability, particularly in point-of-care (POC) settings. We established a hemagglutination-based AB test that is based on bi-specific proteins which contain a dromedary-derived antibody (nanobody) binding red blood cells (RBD) and a SARS-CoV-2-derived antigen, such as the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein (Spike-RBD). While the nanobody mediates swift binding to RBC, the antigen moiety directs instantaneous, visually apparent hemagglutination in the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific AB generated in COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals. Method comparison studies with assays cleared by emergency use authorization demonstrate high specificity and sensitivity. To further increase objectivity of test interpretation, we developed an image analysis tool based on digital image acquisition (via a cell phone) and a machine learning algorithm based on defined sample-training and -validation datasets. Preliminary data, including a small clinical study, provides proof of principle for test performance in a POC setting. Together, the data support the interpretation that this AB test format, which we refer to as 'NanoSpot.ai', is suitable for POC testing, can be manufactured at very low costs and, based on its generic mode of action, can likely be adapted to a variety of other pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Given the complexities of testing the translational capability of new artificial intelligence (AI) tools, we aimed to map the pathways of training/validation/testing in development process and external validation of AI tools evaluated in dedicated randomised controlled trials (AI-RCTs).\nWe searched for peer-reviewed protocols and completed AI-RCTs evaluating the clinical effectiveness of AI tools and identified development and validation studies of AI tools. We collected detailed information, and evaluated patterns of development and external validation of AI tools.\nWe found 23 AI-RCTs evaluating the clinical impact of 18 unique AI tools (2009-2021). Standard-of-care interventions were used in the control arms in all but one AI-RCT. Investigators did not provide access to the software code of the AI tool in any of the studies. Considering the primary outcome, the results were in favour of the AI intervention in 82% of the completed AI-RCTs (14 out of 17). We identified significant variation in the patterns of development, external validation and clinical evaluation approaches among different AI tools. A published development study was found only for 10 of the 18 AI tools. Median time from the publication of a development study to the respective AI-RCT was 1.4 years (IQR 0.2-2.2).\nWe found significant variation in the patterns of development and validation for AI tools before their evaluation in dedicated AI-RCTs. Published peer-reviewed protocols and completed AI-RCTs were also heterogeneous in design and reporting. Upcoming guidelines providing guidance for the development and clinical translation process aim to improve these aspects.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are poised to transform infectious disease testing. Uniquely, infectious disease testing is technologically diverse spaces in laboratory medicine, where multiple platforms and approaches may be required to support clinical decision-making. Despite advances in laboratory informatics, the vast array of infectious disease data is constrained by human analytical limitations. Machine learning can exploit multiple data streams, including but not limited to laboratory information and overcome human limitations to provide physicians with predictive and actionable results. As a quickly evolving area of computer science, laboratory professionals should become aware of AI/ML applications for infectious disease testing as more platforms are become commercially available.\nIn this review we: (a) define both AI/ML, (b) provide an overview of common ML approaches used in laboratory medicine, (c) describe the current AI/ML landscape as it relates infectious disease testing, and (d) discuss the future evolution AI/ML for infectious disease testing in both laboratory and point-of-care applications.\nThe review provides an important educational overview of AI/ML technique in the context of infectious disease testing. This includes supervised ML approaches, which are frequently used in laboratory medicine applications including infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, sepsis, hepatitis, malaria, meningitis, Lyme disease, and tuberculosis. We also apply the concept of \"data fusion\" describing the future of laboratory testing where multiple data streams are integrated by AI/ML to provide actionable clinical knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Neurotoxicology is a specialty that aims to understand and explain the impact of chemicals, xenobiotics and physical conditions on nervous system function throughout the life span. Herein, we point to the need for integration of novel translational bioinformatics and chemo-informatics approaches, such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to the discipline. Specifically, we advance the notion that AI and ML will be helpful in identifying neurotoxic signatures, provide reliable data in predicting neurotoxicity in the context of genetic variability, and improve the understanding of neurotoxic outcomes associated with exposures to mixtures, to name a few.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence, or the ability to perceive, understand, and regulate emotions, has been identified as a protective factor for one's adaptation. Measuring emotional intelligence using performance-based approach is thought to be objective and effective. However, performance-based emotional intelligence instruments for non-Western adolescents are rarely available. To facilitate research on emotional intelligence, the present study developed and validated the emotional intelligence test for adolescents (A-EIT) using a Chinese sample. Study 1 (N = 1,536) showed that emotional intelligence consists of three subabilities (i.e., emotion perception, emotion understanding, and emotion regulation) and identified eligible items for each subtest through exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Study 2 (N = 2,568) confirmed the three-factor structure and its measurement invariance across gender and age groups by (multiple-group) confirmatory factor analyses. Both the full test and its three subtests showed acceptable internal consistencies, and their scores increased with age and showed female advantage. Also, the A-EIT scores were significantly correlated with indicators related to emotional and cognitive skills (convergent validity) and were independent of personality (discriminant validity). Additionally, higher scores on the A-EIT were related to better intrapersonal, interpersonal, and academic adaption (criterion validity), as expected. Study 3 (N = 163) provided further convergent validity evidence for each subtest by using validity tools not based on an emotional intelligence framework. Additionally, the A-EIT displayed satisfactory test-retest reliability. Generally, the A-EIT appears to be a valid and reliable instrument to assess adolescents' emotion intelligence, especially those with relatively low level.

    "abstract": "The excessive number of COVID-19 cases reported worldwide so far, supplemented by a high rate of false alarms in its diagnosis using the conventional polymerase chain reaction method, has led to an increased number of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) examinations conducted. The manual inspection of the latter, besides being slow, is susceptible to human errors, especially because of an uncanny resemblance between the CT scans of COVID-19 and those of pneumonia, and therefore demands a proportional increase in the number of expert radiologists. Artificial intelligence-based computer-aided diagnosis of COVID-19 using the CT scans has been recently coined, which has proven its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and computation time. In this work, a similar framework for classification of COVID-19 using CT scans is proposed. The proposed method includes four core steps: (i) preparing a database of three different classes such as COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal; (ii) modifying three pretrained deep learning models such as VGG16, ResNet50, and ResNet101 for the classification of COVID-19-positive scans; (iii) proposing an activation function and improving the firefly algorithm for feature selection; and (iv) fusing optimal selected features using descending order serial approach and classifying using multiclass supervised learning algorithms. We demonstrate that once this method is performed on a publicly available dataset, this system attains an improved accuracy of 97.9% and the computational time is almost 34 (sec).",

    "abstract": "Most early lung cancers present as pulmonary nodules on imaging, but these can be easily missed on chest radiographs.\nTo assess if a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm can help detect pulmonary nodules on radiographs at different levels of detection difficulty.\nThis diagnostic study included 100 posteroanterior chest radiograph images taken between 2000 and 2010 of adult patients from an ambulatory health care center in Germany and a lung image database in the US. Included images were selected to represent nodules with different levels of detection difficulties (from easy to difficult), and comprised both normal and nonnormal control.\nAll images were processed with a novel AI algorithm, the AI Rad Companion Chest X-ray. Two thoracic radiologists established the ground truth and 9 test radiologists from Germany and the US independently reviewed all images in 2 sessions (unaided and AI-aided mode) with at least a 1-month washout period.\nEach test radiologist recorded the presence of 5 findings (pulmonary nodules, atelectasis, consolidation, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion) and their level of confidence for detecting the individual finding on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 representing lowest confidence; 10, highest confidence). The analyzed metrics for nodules included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and receiver operating characteristics curve area under the curve (AUC).\nImages from 100 patients were included, with a mean (SD) age of 55 (20) years and including 64 men and 36 women. Mean detection accuracy across the 9 radiologists improved by 6.4% (95% CI, 2.3% to 10.6%) with AI-aided interpretation compared with unaided interpretation. Partial AUCs within the effective interval range of 0 to 0.2 false positive rate improved by 5.6% (95% CI, -1.4% to 12.0%) with AI-aided interpretation. Junior radiologists saw greater improvement in sensitivity for nodule detection with AI-aided interpretation as compared with their senior counterparts (12%; 95% CI, 4% to 19% vs 9%; 95% CI, 1% to 17%) while senior radiologists experienced similar improvement in specificity (4%; 95% CI, -2% to 9%) as compared with junior radiologists (4%; 95% CI, -3% to 5%).\nIn this diagnostic study, an AI algorithm was associated with improved detection of pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs compared with unaided interpretation for different levels of detection difficulty and for readers with different experience.",

    "abstract": "Earlier research has identified both synergistic and compensatory personality traits by intelligence interaction effects on academic performance.\nThe present study employed data on intelligence, personality traits, and academic performance in the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97, N\u2009=\u20098984).\nSome intelligence by personality trait interaction effects, mainly involving indicators of dependability, on high school grades were identified.

    "abstract": "The aim of this scoping review is to examine artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual teaching models within the context of dental education, establish methods to address the resources being investigated, and ultimately augment this approach for future scientific research.\nTo evaluate the applications of AI and immersive technology, a scoping literature review was conducted using the Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library database from the years 2018 to May 19, 2021. Additionally, a manual search was completed. The search strategy was formulated according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Studies that addressed the current uses of virtual devices and their revolutionary potential in dental education were categorized separately for further evaluation.\n\u00a0Of the 2500 articles found in our initial search results, 31 articles met the inclusion criteria set for this review. The selected studies were directly related to AI and immersive tools in dental education.\nTo our knowledge, there are very few comprehensive literature reviews identifying the applications and efficacy of virtual and AI-driven tools in dental education. With limited verifiable evidence, an improved understanding of virtual and AI domains is needed to enable dental students to adapt to changes within and beyond their dental training education. To increase the scientific value of digital-related research, the scientific community must quickly define guidelines to enhance methodological approaches in order to effectively digitalize dentistry.",

    "conclusions": "To our knowledge, there are very few comprehensive literature reviews identifying the applications and efficacy of virtual and AI-driven tools in dental education. With limited verifiable evidence, an improved understanding of virtual and AI domains is needed to enable dental students to adapt to changes within and beyond their dental training education. To increase the scientific value of digital-related research, the scientific community must quickly define guidelines to enhance methodological approaches in order to effectively digitalize dentistry.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the application of positron emission tomography- (PET-) computed tomography (CT) image information data combined with serous cavity effusion based on clone selection artificial intelligence algorithm in the diagnosis of patients with malignant tumors. A total of 97 patients with PET-CT scanning and empirically confirmed as serous cavity effusion were retrospectively analyzed in this study. The clone selection artificial intelligence algorithm was applied to register the PET-CT images, and the patients were rolled into a benign effusion group and a malignant effusion group according to the benign and malignant conditions of the serous cavity effusion. Besides, the causes of patients from the two groups were analyzed, and there was a comparison of their physiological conditions. Subsequently, CT values of different KeV, lipid/water, water/iodine, and water/calcium concentrations were measured, and the differences of the above quantitative parameters between benign and malignant serous cavity effusion were compared, as well as the registration results of the clone algorithm. The results showed that the registration time and misalignment times of clonal selection algorithm (13.88, 0) were lower than those of genetic algorithm (18.72, 8). There were marked differences in CT values of 40-60\u2009keV and 130-140\u2009keV between the two groups. The concentrations of lipid/water, water/iodine, and water/calcium in basal substances of the malignant effusion group were obviously higher than the concentrations of the benign effusion group (",

    "abstract": "Physiological measures, such as heart rate variability (HRV) and beats per minute (BPM), can be powerful health indicators of respiratory infections. HRV and BPM can be acquired through widely available wrist-worn biometric wearables and smartphones. Successive abnormal changes in these indicators could potentially be an early sign of respiratory infections such as COVID-19. Thus, wearables and smartphones should play a significant role in combating COVID-19 through the early detection supported by other contextual data and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. In this paper, we investigate the role of the heart measurements (i.e., HRV and BPM) collected from wearables and smartphones in demonstrating early onsets of the inflammatory response to the COVID-19. The AI framework consists of two blocks: an interpretable prediction model to classify the HRV measurements status (as normal or affected by inflammation) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to analyze users' daily status (i.e., textual logs in a mobile application). Both classification decisions are integrated to generate the final decision as either \"potentially COVID-19 infected\" or \"no evident signs of infection\". We used a publicly available dataset, which comprises 186 patients with more than 3200 HRV readings and numerous user textual logs. The first evaluation of the approach showed an accuracy of 83.34 \u00b1 1.68% with 0.91, 0.88, 0.89 precision, recall, and F1-Score, respectively, in predicting the infection two days before the onset of the symptoms supported by a model interpretation using the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).",

    "abstract": "The development of artificial intelligence and the Internet of things has motivated extensive research on self-powered flexible sensors. The conventional sensor must be powered by a battery device, while innovative self-powered sensors can provide power for the sensing device. Self-powered flexible sensors can have higher mobility, wider distribution, and even wireless operation, while solving the problem of the limited life of the battery so that it can be continuously operated and widely utilized. In recent years, the studies on piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have mainly concentrated on self-powered flexible sensors. Self-powered flexible sensors based on PENGs and TENGs have been reported as sensing devices in many application fields, such as human health monitoring, environmental monitoring, wearable devices, electronic skin, human-machine interfaces, robots, and intelligent transportation and cities. This review summarizes the development process of the sensor in terms of material design and structural optimization, as well as introduces its frontier applications in related fields. We also look forward to the development prospects and future of self-powered flexible sensors.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of machine learning methods, the continuous improvement of forecast accuracy has become an important task, which is especially crucial for landslide displacement predictions. This study aimed to propose a novel prediction model to improve accuracy in landslide prediction, based on the combination of multiple new algorithms. The proposed new method includes three parts: data preparation, multi-swarm intelligence (MSI) optimization, and displacement prediction. In the data preparation, the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) is adopted to separate the trend and periodic displacements from the observed cumulative landslide displacement. The frequency component and residual component of reconstructed inducing factors that related to landslide movements are also extracted by the CEEMD and ",

There is a great increase in the crime rate, and the handling officers are responsible for dealing with a broad range of cyber and Internet issues during investigation. IoT technologies are helpful in the identification of suspects, and few technologies are available that use IoT and deep learning together for face sketch synthesis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other constructs of deep learning have become major tools in recent approaches. A new-found architecture of the neural network is anticipated in this work. It is called Spiral-Net, which is a modified version of U-Net fto perform face sketch synthesis (the phase is known as the compiler network C here).

    "abstract": "Malnutrition is common, especially among older, hospitalised patients, and is associated with higher mortality, longer hospitalisation stays, infections, and loss of muscle mass. It is therefore of utmost importance to employ a proper method for dietary assessment that can be used for the identification and management of malnourished hospitalised patients. In this study, we propose an automated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based system that receives input images of the meals before and after their consumption and is able to estimate the patient's energy, carbohydrate, protein, fat, and fatty acids intake. The system jointly segments the images into the different food components and plate types, estimates the volume of each component before and after consumption, and calculates the energy and macronutrient intake for every meal, based on the kitchen's menu database. Data acquired from an acute geriatric hospital as well as from our previous study were used for the fine-tuning and evaluation of the system. The results from both our system and the hospital's standard procedure were compared to the estimations of experts. Agreement was better with the system, suggesting that it has the potential to replace standard clinical procedures with a positive impact on time spent directly with the patients.",

    "abstract": "Given the globally abundant availability of waste plastics and the negative environmental impacts of textile dyeing sludge (TDS), their co-combustion can effectively enhance the circular economies, energy recovery, and environmental pollution control. The (co-)combustion performances, gas emissions, and ashes of TDS and two plastics of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were quantified and characterized. The increased blend ratio of PP and PE improved the ignition, burnout, and comprehensive combustion indices. The two plastics interacted with TDS significantly in the range of 200-600\u00a0\u2103. TDS pre-ignited the combustion of the plastics which in turn promoted the combustion of TDS. The co-combustions released more CO",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) performs human intelligence-dependant tasks using tools such as Machine Learning, and its subtype Deep Learning. AI has incorporated itself in the field of cardiovascular medicine, and increasingly employed to revolutionize diagnosis, treatment, risk prediction, clinical care, and drug discovery. Heart failure has a high prevalence, and mortality rate following hospitalization being 10.4% at 30-days, 22% at 1-year, and 42.3% at 5-years. Early detection of heart failure is of vital importance in shaping the medical, and surgical interventions specific to HF patients. This has been accomplished with the advent of Neural Network (NN) model, the accuracy of which has proven to be 85%. AI can be of tremendous help in analyzing raw image data from cardiac imaging techniques (such as echocardiography, computed tomography, cardiac MRI amongst others) and electrocardiogram recordings through incorporation of an algorithm. The use of decision trees by Rough Sets (RS), and logistic regression (LR) methods utilized to construct decision-making model to diagnose congestive heart failure, and role of AI in early detection of future mortality and destabilization episodes has played a vital role in optimizing cardiovascular disease outcomes. The review highlights the major achievements of AI in recent years that has radically changed nearly all areas of HF prevention, diagnosis, and management.",

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) is an auxiliary modality in the diagnosis of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease and can guide physicians in the presence of lung involvement. In this study, we aimed to investigate the contribution of deep learning to diagnosis in patients with typical COVID-19 pneumonia findings on CT.\nThis study retrospectively evaluated 690 lesions obtained from 35 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia based on typical findings on non-contrast high-resolution CT (HRCT) in our hospital. The diagnoses of the patients were also confirmed by other necessary tests. HRCT images were assessed in the parenchymal window. In the images obtained, COVID-19 lesions were detected. For the deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm, the Confusion matrix was used based on a Tensorflow Framework in Python.\nA total of 596 labeled lesions obtained from 224 sections of the images were used for the training of the algorithm, 89 labeled lesions from 27 sections were used in validation, and 67 labeled lesions from 25 images in testing. Fifty-six of the 67 lesions used in the testing stage were accurately detected by the algorithm while the remaining 11 were not recognized. There was no false positive. The Recall, Precision and F1 score values in the test group were 83.58, 1, and 91.06, respectively.\nWe successfully detected the COVID-19 pneumonia lesions on CT images using the algorithms created with artificial intelligence. The integration of deep learning into the diagnostic stage in medicine is an important step for the diagnosis of diseases that can cause lung involvement in possible future pandemics.",

    "abstract": "Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) is a cardiac disease that can lead to fatal consequences. MitraClip (MC) intervention is a percutaneous procedure whereby the mitral valve (MV) leaflets are connected along the edge using MCs. The outcomes of the MC intervention are not known in advance, i.e., the outcomes are quite variable. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to guide the cardiologist in selecting optimal MC scenarios. In this study, we describe an atlas of shapes as well as different scenarios for MC implantation for such an AI analysis. We generated the MV geometrical data from three different sources. First, the patients' 3-dimensional echo images were used. The pixel data from six key points were obtained from three views of the echo images. Using PyGem, an open-source morphing library in Python, these coordinates were used to create the geometry by morphing a template geometry. Second, the dimensions of the MV, from the literature were used to create data. Third, we used machine learning methods, principal component analysis, and generative adversarial networks to generate more shapes. We used the finite element (FE) software ABAQUS to simulate smoothed particle hydrodynamics in different scenarios for MC intervention. The MR and stresses in the leaflets were post-processed. Our physics-based FE models simulated the outcomes of MC intervention for different scenarios. The MR and stresses in the leaflets were computed by the FE models for a single clip at different locations as well as two and three clips. Results from FE simulations showed that the location and number of MCs affect subsequent residual MR, and that leaflet stresses do not follow a simple pattern. Furthermore, FE models need several hours to provide the results, and they are not applicable for clinical usage where the predicted outcomes of MC therapy are needed in real-time. In this study, we generated the required dataset for the AI models which can provide the results in a matter of seconds.",

The differences in accuracy (Acc), recall (RE), sensitivity (Sen), and running time between the two models before and after optimization and other algorithms are compared. A total of 48 female patients with nipple discharge are enrolled. The differences in SE, specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of conventional ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography are analyzed based on pathological examination results. The results showed that when the number of network layers is 5, the classification accuracies of DNS and ODNS model data reached the highest values, which were 91.45% and 98.64%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "This study was aimed at exploring the application value of transcranial Doppler (TCD) based on artificial intelligence algorithm in monitoring the neuroendocrine changes in patients with severe head injury in the acute phase; 80 patients with severe brain injury were included in this study as the study subjects, and they were randomly divided into the control group (conventional TCD) and the experimental group (algorithm-optimized TCD), 40 patients in each group. An artificial intelligence neighborhood segmentation algorithm for TCD images was designed to comprehensively evaluate the application value of this algorithm by measuring the TCD image area segmentation error and running time of this algorithm. In addition, the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and each neuroendocrine hormone level were used to assess the neuroendocrine status of the patients. The results showed that the running time of the artificial intelligence neighborhood segmentation algorithm for TCD was 3.14 \u00b1 1.02\u2009s, which was significantly shorter than 32.23 \u00b1 9.56\u2009s of traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms (",

    "abstract": "Research in molecular sciences witnessed the rise and fall of Artificial Intelligence (AI)/ Machine Learning (ML) methods, especially artificial neural networks, few decades ago. However, we see a major resurgence in the use of modern ML methods in scientific research during the last few years. These methods have had phenomenal success in the areas of computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), etc. This has inspired chemists and biologists to apply these algorithms to problems in natural sciences. Availability of high performance Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerators, large datasets, new algorithms, and libraries has enabled this surge. ML algorithms have successfully been applied to various domains in molecular sciences by providing much faster and sometimes more accurate solutions compared to traditional methods like Quantum Mechanical (QM) calculations, Density Functional Theory (DFT) or Molecular Mechanics (MM) based methods, etc. Some of the areas where the potential of ML methods are shown to be effective are in drug design, prediction of high-level quantum mechanical energies, molecular design, molecular dynamics materials, and retrosynthesis of organic compounds, etc. This article intends to conceptually introduce various modern ML methods and their relevance and applications in computational natural sciences.

    "abstract": "The Trauma Outcomes Predictor tool was recently derived using a machine learning methodology called optimal classification trees and validated for prediction of outcomes in trauma patients. The Trauma Outcomes Predictor is available as an interactive smartphone application. In this study, we sought to assess the performance of the Trauma Outcomes Predictor in the elderly trauma patient.\nAll patients aged 65 years and older in the American College of Surgeons-Trauma Quality Improvement Program 2017 database were included. The performance of the Trauma Outcomes Predictor in predicting in-hospital mortality and combined and specific morbidity based on incidence of 9 specific in-hospital complications was assessed using the c-statistic methodology, with planned subanalyses for patients 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85+ years.\nA total of 260,505 patients were included. Median age was 77 (71-84) years, 57% were women, and 98.8% had a blunt mechanism of injury. The Trauma Outcomes Predictor accurately predicted mortality in all patients, with excellent performance for penetrating trauma (c-statistic: 0.92) and good performance for blunt trauma (c-statistic: 0.83). Its best performance was in patients 65 to 74 years (c-statistic: blunt 0.86, penetrating 0.93). Among blunt trauma patients, the Trauma Outcomes Predictor had the best discrimination for predicting acute respiratory distress syndrome (c-statistic 0.75) and cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (c-statistic 0.75). Among penetrating trauma patients, the Trauma Outcomes Predictor had the best discrimination for deep and organ space surgical site infections (c-statistics 0.95 and 0.84, respectively).\nThe Trauma Outcomes Predictor is a novel, interpretable, and highly accurate predictor of in-hospital mortality in the elderly trauma patient up to age 85 years. The Trauma Outcomes Predictor could prove useful for bedside counseling of elderly patients and their families and for benchmarking the quality of geriatric trauma care.",

    "abstract": "Since the coronavirus disease has been declared a global pandemic, it had posed a challenge among researchers and raised common awareness and collaborative efforts towards finding the solution. Caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus drug design strategy needs to be optimized. It is understandable that cognizance of the pathobiology of COVID-19 can help scientists in the development and discovery of therapeutically effective antiviral drugs by elucidating the unknown viral pathways and structures. Considering the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning with its advancements in the field of science, it is rational to use these methods which can aid in the discovery of new potent candidates in silico. Our review utilizes similar methodologies and focuses on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), based on its importance as an essential element for virus replication and also a promising target for COVID-19 therapeutics. Artificial neural network technique was used to shortlist articles with the support of PRISMA, from different research platforms including Scopus, PubMed, PubChem, and Web of Science, through a combination of keywords. \"English language\", from the year \"2000\" and \"published articles in journals\" were selected to carry out this research. We summarized that structural details of the RdRp reviewed in this analysis will have the potential to be taken into consideration when developing therapeutic solutions and if further multidisciplinary efforts are taken in this domain then potential clinical candidates for RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 could be successfully delivered for experimental validations.",

    "abstract": "Proteins interact through their interfaces to fulfill essential functions in the cell. They bind to their partners in a highly specific manner and form complexes that have a profound effect on understanding the biological pathways they are involved in. Any abnormal interactions may cause diseases. Therefore, the identification of small molecules which modulate protein interactions through their interfaces has high therapeutic potential. However, discovering such molecules is challenging. Most protein-protein binding affinity is attributed to a small set of amino acids found in protein interfaces known as hot spots. Recent studies demonstrate that drug-like small molecules specifically may bind to hot spots. Therefore, hot spot prediction is crucial. As experimental data accumulates, artificial intelligence begins to be used for computational hot spot prediction. First, we review machine learning and deep learning for computational hot spot prediction and then explain the significance of hot spots toward\u00a0drug design.",

    "abstract": "Primary care is the largest healthcare delivery platform in the US. Facing the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technology (AI/ML) revolution, the primary care community would benefit from a roadmap revealing priority areas and opportunities for developing and integrating AI/ML-driven clinical tools. This article presents a framework that identifies five domains for AI/ML integration in primary care to support care delivery transformation and achieve the Quintuple Aims of the healthcare system. We concluded that primary care plays a critical role in developing, introducing, implementing, and monitoring AI/ML tools in healthcare and must not be overlooked as AI/ML transforms healthcare.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesize that artificial intelligence (AI) applied to relevant clinical testing in glaucoma has the potential to enhance the ability to detect glaucoma. This premise was discussed at the recent Collaborative Community on Ophthalmic Imaging meeting, \"The Future of Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Ophthalmic Image Interpretation: Accelerating Innovation and Implementation Pathways,\" held virtually September 3-4,\u00a02020. The Collaborative Community on Ophthalmic Imaging (CCOI) is an independent self-governing consortium of stakeholders with broad international representation from academic institutions, government agencies, and the private sector whose mission is to act as a forum for the purpose of helping speed innovation in healthcare technology. It was 1 of the first 2 such organizations officially designated by the Food and Drug Administration in September 2019 in response to their announcement of the collaborative community program as a strategic priority for 2018-2020. Further information on the CCOI can be found online at their website (https://www.cc-oi.org/about). Artificial intelligence for glaucoma diagnosis would have high utility globally, because access to care is limited in many parts of the world and half of all people with glaucoma are unaware of their illness. The application of AI technology to glaucoma diagnosis has the potential to broadly increase access to care worldwide, in essence flattening the Earth by providing expert-level evaluation to individuals even in the most remote regions of the planet.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm relies on surgical repair and the indication mainly depends on its size evaluated by the maximal diameter (Dmax). The aim of this study was to evaluate a new automatic method based on artificial intelligence to measure the Dmax on computed tomography angiography.\nA fully automatic segmentation of the vascular system was performed using a hybrid method combining expert system with supervised deep learning. The aorta centreline was extracted from the segmented aorta and the aortic diameters were automatically calculated. Results were compared to manual segmentation performed by two human operators.\nThe median absolute error between the two human operators was 1.2 mm (IQR 0.5-1.9). The automatic method using the deep learning algorithm demonstrated correlation with the human segmentation, with a median absolute error of 0.8 (0.5-4.2) mm and a coefficient correlation of 0.91 (P < 0.001).\nAlthough validation in larger cohorts is required, this method brings perspectives to develop new tools to standardize and automate the measurement of abdominal aortic aneurysm Dmax in order to help clinicians in the decision-making process.",

    "abstract": "India reported a severe public health challenge not only due to the COVID-19 outbreak but also the increasing number of associated mucormycosis cases since 2021.This study aimed at developing artificial intelligence based models to predict the risk of mucormycosis among the patients at the time of discharge from hospital.\nThe dataset included of 1229 COVID-19 positive patients, and additional 214 inpatients, COVID-19 positive as well as infected with mucormycosis. We used logistic regression, decision tree and random forest and the extreme gradient boosting algorithm. All our models were evaluated with 5-fold validation to derive a reliable estimate of the model error.\nThe logistic regression, XGBoost and random forest performed equally well with AUROC 95.0, 94.0, and 94.0 respectively. The best accuracy and precision (PPV) were 0.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.026 and 0.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0526, respectively achieved by XGBoost, followed by logistic regression. This study also determined top five variables namely obesity, anosmia, de novo diabetes, myalgia, and nasal discharge, which showed positive impact towards the risk of mucormycosis.\nThe developed model has the potential to predict the patients at high risk and thus, consequently initiating preventive care or aiding in early detection of mucormycosis infection. Thus, this study, holds potential for early treatment and better management of patients suffering from COVID-19 associated mucormycosis.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis plays an essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing cancer progression. Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic protein, is an important modulator of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and is a promising target for anticancer therapy. In this study, we identified octenidine as a novel Bcl-xL inhibitor through structural feature-based deep learning and molecular docking from a library of approved drugs. The NMR experiments demonstrated that octenidine binds to the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain-binding hydrophobic region that consists of the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains in Bcl-xL. A structural model of the Bcl-xL/octenidine complex revealed that octenidine binds to Bcl-xL in a similar manner to that of the well-known Bcl-2 family protein antagonist ABT-737. Using the NanoBiT protein-protein interaction system, we confirmed that the interaction between Bcl-xL and Bak-BH3 domains within cells was inhibited by octenidine. Furthermore, octenidine inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 breast and H1299 lung cancer cells by promoting apoptosis. Taken together, our results shed light on a novel mechanism in which octenidine directly targets anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL to trigger mitochondrial apoptosis in cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Aifred is a clinical decision support system (CDSS) that uses artificial intelligence to assist physicians in selecting treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) by providing probabilities of remission for different treatment options based on patient characteristics. We evaluated the utility of the CDSS as perceived by physicians participating in simulated clinical interactions. Twenty physicians who were either staff or residents in psychiatry or family medicine completed a study in which they had three 10-minute clinical interactions with standardized patients portraying mild, moderate, and severe episodes of MDD. During these scenarios, physicians were given access to the CDSS, which they could use in their treatment decisions. The perceived utility of the CDSS was assessed through self-report questionnaires, scenario observations, and interviews. 60% of physicians perceived the CDSS to be a useful tool in their treatment-selection process, with family physicians perceiving the greatest utility. Moreover, 50% of physicians would use the tool for all patients with depression, with an additional 35% noting that they would reserve the tool for more severe or treatment-resistant patients. Furthermore, clinicians found the tool to be useful in discussing treatment options with patients. The efficacy of this CDSS and its potential to improve treatment outcomes must be further evaluated in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Chronic diseases are a growing concern worldwide, with nearly 25% of adults suffering from one or more chronic health conditions, thus placing a heavy burden on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. With the advent of the \"Smart Healthcare\" era, a series of cutting-edge technologies has brought new experiences to the management of chronic diseases. Among them, smart wearable technology not only helps people pursue a healthier lifestyle but also provides a continuous flow of healthcare data for disease diagnosis and treatment by actively recording physiological parameters and tracking the metabolic state. However, how to organize and analyze the data to achieve the ultimate goal of improving chronic disease management, in terms of quality of life, patient outcomes, and privacy protection, is an urgent issue that needs to be addressed. Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide intelligent suggestions by analyzing a patient's physiological data from wearable devices for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. In addition, blockchain can improve healthcare services by authorizing decentralized data sharing, protecting the privacy of users, providing data empowerment, and ensuring the reliability of data management. Integrating AI, blockchain, and wearable technology could optimize the existing chronic disease management models, with a shift from a hospital-centered model to a patient-centered one. In this paper, we conceptually demonstrate a patient-centric technical framework based on AI, blockchain, and wearable technology and further explore the application of these integrated technologies in chronic disease management. Finally, the shortcomings of this new paradigm and future research directions are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds are increasingly engaging in research and development in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The main activities, although still nascent, are coalescing around three core activities: innovation, policy, and capacity building. Within agriculture, which is the focus of this paper, AI is working with converging technologies, particularly data optimization, to add value along the entire agricultural value chain, including procurement, farm automation, and market access. Our key takeaway is that, despite the promising opportunities for development, there are actual and potential challenges that African countries need to consider in deciding whether to scale up or down the application of AI in agriculture. Input from African innovators, policymakers, and academics is essential to ensure that AI solutions are aligned with African needs and priorities. This paper proposes questions that can be used to form a road map to inform research and development in this area.",

    "abstract": "The beliefs of laypeople and medical professionals often diverge with regards to disease, and technology has had a positive impact on how research is conducted. Surprisingly, given the expanding worldwide funding and research into Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare, there is a paucity of research exploring the public patient perspective on this technology. Our study sets out to address this knowledge gap, by applying the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) to explore patient public views on AI.\nA Nominal Group Technique (NGT) was used involving four study groups with seven participants in each group. This started with a silent generation of ideas regarding the benefits and concerns of AI in Healthcare. Then a group discussion and round-robin process were conducted until no new ideas were generated. Participants ranked their top five benefits and top five concerns regarding the use of AI in healthcare. A final group consensus was reached.\nTwenty-Eight participants were recruited with the mean age of 47 years. The top five benefits were: Faster health services, Greater accuracy in management, AI systems available 24/7, reducing workforce burden, and equality in healthcare decision making. The top five concerns were: Data cybersecurity, bias and quality of AI data, less human interaction, algorithm errors and responsibility, and limitation in technology.\nThis is the first formal qualitative study exploring patient public views on the use of AI in healthcare, and highlights that there is a clear understanding of the potential benefits delivered by this technology. Greater patient public group involvement, and a strong regulatory framework is recommended.",

    "abstract": "To study the relationship between folic acid and 25-hydroxy vitamin D[25(OH)D] and intelligence and core symptoms in children with autism.\nA total of 124 children with autism aged 3-6 years who were admitted to The Fouth Affiliated Hospital of Qiqihar Medical College from March 2018 to March 2021 were enrolled as the case group, and 120 healthy children who underwent physical examination in hospital during the same period were selected as the control group. Respectively in the hospital the same day or physical examination on two groups of children fasting venous blood collected 4 mL, let stand centrifugal after processing into-80 \u2103 refrigerator, using chemiluminescence immunoassay and high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry detection of two groups of children folic acid and serum 25(OH)D level, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent method to detect the serum level of folic acid metabolites. For the children in the case group and the control group, the Wechsler scale for early childhood and child intelligence(WISC) was used to assess intelligence. Core symptoms of autism were assessed using the behavior scale for autistic children(ABC). T test was used to compare serum folic acid and 25(OH)D levels, WISC and ABC scale scores between the case group and the control group. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between serum folic acid, 25(OH)D level and intelligence and core symptoms in children with autism.\nThe serum folic acid and 25(OH)D levels in the case group were(16.13\u00b14.26) ng/mL and(25.78\u00b13.24) ng/mL respectively, which were lower than those in the control group(21.58\u00b15.37) ng/mL and(36.94\u00b16.11) ng/mL, with statistical significance(all P&lt;0.05). The WISC scale score of the case group was(62.83\u00b111.73) points, lower than that of the control group(89.42\u00b112.58) points, while the ABC scale score was(77.39\u00b110.28) points, higher than that of the control group(42.30\u00b15.87) points, with statistical significance(all P&lt;0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed that serum folic acid and 25(OH)D levels were positively correlated with WISC score(r=0.512, 0.584; P=0.012, 0.001), and was negatively correlated with ABC scale score(r=-0.546, -0.602; P=0.008, &lt;0.001). The serum THFA and 5-MTHF levels in the case group were(3.85\u00b11.22) ng/mL and(4.84\u00b11.32) ng/mL respectively, which were lower than those in the control group(4.30\u00b11.51) ng/mL and(5.34\u00b11.34) ng/mL respectively. The serum FRAA level was(433.29\u00b174.34) pg/mL, higher than that of the control group(402.10\u00b165.87) pg/mL, with statistical significance(all P&lt;0.05).\nThe serum folic acid and 25(OH)D levels are lower in children with autism, and are closely related to the intelligence and core symptoms of the children, that is, with the decline of the two serological indicators, the lower the intelligence of children with autism, and the more obvious the core symptoms.",

    "abstract": "As recent meta-analyses confirmed that emotional intelligence (EI), particularly strategic EI, adjoins intelligence and personality in predicting academic achievement, we explored possible arrangements in which these predictors affect the given outcome in adolescents. Three models, with versions including either overall strategic EI or its branches, were considered: (a) a mediation model, whereby strategic EI partially mediates the effects of verbal intelligence (VI) and personality on achievement; the branch-level version assumed that emotion understanding affects achievement in a cascade via emotion management; (b) a direct effects model, with strategic EI/branches placed alongside VI and personality as another independent predictor of achievement; and (c) a moderation model, whereby personality moderates the effects of VI and strategic EI/branches on achievement. We tested these models in a sample of 227 students (",

The present study therefore aims to determine the association of vitamin D status with the different domains of intelligence among Saudi Arabian adolescents. This study used relational survey method among 1864 Saudi adolescent, including 549 boys and 1315 girls (mean age 14.7 \u00b1 1.7 years) recruited using a multistage, stratified cluster randomization of 47 public and private schools in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. A general questionnaire was used to collect demographic information. Intelligence was assessed using multiple intelligence inventory. Anthropometrics were measured and fasting blood samples collected for assessment of glucose and lipid profile. Vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <50 nmol/L) was observed in 84.2% of boys and 93.5% of girls. Girls had higher levels of verbal, kinesthetic, musical, naturalist and existential intelligence than boys, while boys have higher logical intelligence than girls (",

    "abstract": "Due to the demanding changes caused in the population by the COVID-19 pandemic, including a persisting experience of fear and social isolation, multiple studies have focused on the protective role of several psychological characteristics on mental health. Emotional intelligence and social support are commonly linked to mental health and well-being. The present study aims to analyze the mediator role of emotional intelligence and social support on university students' mental health, taking into consideration the role of gender differences. An online questionnaire was administered to a sample of 923 university students during the COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal. Significant gender differences were found on mental health symptoms, emotional intelligence, and social support. A double mediation model was computed to verify if gender influences on mental health were mediated by emotional intelligence and social support. The results show indirect effects of gender on mental health. However, as both mediators mediate in the opposite direction, the total indirect effects become null. Thus, a strong direct effect of gender on mental health remains. The results of the present study have theoretical implications on protective factors of mental health by gender and practical implications for psychological intervention in university counselling services.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to perceive, express, understand, and manage emotions. Current research indicates that it may protect against the emotional burden experienced in certain professions. This article aims to provide an updated systematic review of existing instruments to assess EI in professionals, focusing on the description of their characteristics as well as their psychometric properties (reliability and validity). A literature search was conducted in Web of Science (WoS). A total of 2761 items met the eligibility criteria, from which a total of 40 different instruments were extracted and analysed. Most were based on three main models (i.e., skill-based, trait-based, and mixed), which differ in the way they conceptualize and measure EI. All have been shown to have advantages and disadvantages inherent to the type of tool. The instruments reported in the largest number of studies are Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i), Schutte Self Report-Inventory (SSRI), Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test 2.0 (MSCEIT 2.0), Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS), Wong and Law's Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS), and Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue). The main measure of the estimated reliability has been internal consistency, and the construction of EI measures was predominantly based on linear modelling or classical test theory. The study has limitations: we only searched a single database, the impossibility of estimating inter-rater reliability, and non-compliance with some items required by PRISMA.",

    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of hospitalization that greatly and negatively affects the short-term and long-term outcomes of patients. Current guidelines use serum creatinine level and urine output rate for defining AKI and as the staging criteria of AKI. However, because they are not sensitive or specific markers of AKI, clinicians find it difficult to predict the occurrence of AKI and prescribe timely treatment. Advances in computing technology have led to the recent use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in AKI prediction, recent research reported that by using electronic health records (EHR) the AKI prediction via machine-learning models can reach AUROC over 0.80, in some studies even reach 0.93. Our review begins with the background and history of the definition of AKI, and the evolution of AKI risk factors and prediction models is also appraised. Then, we summarize the current evidence regarding the application of e-alert systems and machine-learning models in AKI prediction.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the use of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) has been increased to claim reimbursement for inpatient care. The overall benefits of using DRGs depend upon the accuracy of clinical coding to obtain reasonable reimbursement. However, the selection of appropriate codes is always challenging and requires professional expertise. The rate of incorrect DRGs is always high due to the heavy workload, poor quality of documentation, and lack of computer assistance. We therefore developed deep learning (DL) models to predict the primary diagnosis for appropriate reimbursement and improving hospital performance. A dataset consisting of 81,486 patients with 128,105 episodes was used for model training and testing. Patients' age, sex, drugs, diseases, laboratory tests, procedures, and operation history were used as inputs to our multiclass prediction model. Gated recurrent unit (GRU) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed to predict 200 primary diagnoses. The performance of the DL models was measured by the area under the receiver operating curve, precision, recall, and F1 score. Of the two DL models, the GRU method, had the best performance in predicting the primary diagnosis (AUC: 0.99, precision: 83.2%, and recall: 66.0%). However, the performance of ANN model for DRGs prediction achieved AUC of 0.99 with a precision of 0.82 and recall of 0.57. The findings of our study show that DL algorithms, especially GRU, can be used to develop DRGs prediction models for identifying primary diagnosis accurately. DeepDRGs would help to claim appropriate financial incentives, enable proper utilization of medical resources, and improve hospital performance.",

    "abstract": "Consultation prioritization is fundamental in optimal healthcare management and its performance can be helped by artificial intelligence (AI)-dedicated software and by digital medicine in general. The need for remote consultation has been demonstrated not only in the pandemic-induced lock-down but also in rurality conditions for which access to health centers is constantly limited. The term \"AI\" indicates the use of a computer to simulate human intellectual behavior with minimal human intervention. AI is based on a \"machine learning\" process or on an artificial neural network. AI provides accurate diagnostic algorithms and personalized treatments in many fields, including oncology, ophthalmology, traumatology, and dermatology. AI can help vascular specialists in diagnostics of peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and deep vein thrombosis by analyzing contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound data and in diagnostics of pulmonary embolism on multi-slice computed angiograms. Automatic methods based on AI may be applied to detect the presence and determine the clinical class of chronic venous disease. Nevertheless, data on using AI in this field are still scarce. In this narrative review, the authors discuss available data on AI implementation in arterial and venous disease diagnostics and care.",

    "abstract": "Fruits provide various vitamins to the human body. The chemical properties of fruits provide useful information to researchers, including determining the ripening time of fruits and the lack of nutrients in them. Conventional methods for determining the chemical properties of fruits are destructive and time-consuming methods that have no application for online operations. For that, various researchers have conducted various studies on non-destructive methods, which are currently in the research and development stage. Thus, the present paper focusses on a non-destructive method based on spectral data in the 200-1100-nm region for estimation of total soluble solids and BrimA in Gala apples. The work steps included: (1) collecting different samples of Gala apples at different stages of maturity; (2) extracting spectral data of samples and pre-preprocessing them; (3) measuring the chemical properties of TSS and BrimA; (4) selecting optimal (effective) wavelengths using artificial neural network-simulated annealing algorithm (ANN-SA); and (5) estimating chemical properties based on partial least squares regression (PLSR) and hybrid artificial neural network known as the imperialist competitive algorithm (ANN-ICA). It should be noted that, in order to investigate the validity of the methods, the estimation algorithm was repeated 500 times. In the end, the results displayed that, in the best training, the ANN-ICA predicted the TSS and BrimA with correlation coefficients of 0.963 and 0.965 and root mean squared error of 0.167% and 0.596%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Stem/progenitor cell transplantation is a potential novel therapeutic strategy to induce angiogenesis in ischemic tissue, which can prevent major amputation in patients with advanced peripheral artery disease (PAD). Thus, clinicians can use cell therapies worldwide to treat PAD. However, some cell therapy studies did not report beneficial outcomes. Clinical researchers have suggested that classical risk factors and comorbidities may adversely affect the efficacy of cell therapy. Some studies have indicated that the response to stem cell therapy varies among patients, even in those harboring limited risk factors. This suggests the role of undetermined risk factors, including genetic alterations, somatic mutations, and clonal hematopoiesis. Personalized stem cell-based therapy can be developed by analyzing individual risk factors. These approaches must consider several clinical biomarkers and perform studies (such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS)) on disease-related genetic traits and integrate the findings with those of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and whole-genome sequencing in PAD. Additional unbiased analyses with state-of-the-art computational methods, such as machine learning-based patient stratification, are suited for predictions in clinical investigations. The integration of these complex approaches into a unified analysis procedure for the identification of responders and non-responders before stem cell therapy, which can decrease treatment expenditure, is a major challenge for increasing the efficacy of therapies.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the 1-year visual acuity predictive performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) based model applied to optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) vascular layers scans from eyes with a full-thickness macular hole (FTMH).\nIn this observational cross-sectional, single-center study, 35 eyes of 35 patients with FTMH were analyzed by OCT-A before and 1-year after surgery. Superficial vascular plexus (SVP) and deep vascular plexus (DVP) images were collected for the analysis. AI approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) was used to generate a continuous predictive variable based on both SVP and DPV. Different pre-trained CNN networks were used for feature extraction and compared for predictive accuracy.\nAmong the different tested models, the inception V3 network, applied on the combination of deep and superficial OCT-A images, showed the most significant differences between the two obtained image clusters defined in C1 and C2 (best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) C1 = 66.67 (16.00 SD) and BCVA C2 = 49.10 (18.60 SD, p = 0.005)).\nThe AI-based analysis of preoperative OCT-A images of eyes affected by FTMH may be a useful support system in setting up visual acuity recovery prediction. The combination of preoperative SVP and DVP images showed a significant morphological predictive performance for visual acuity recovery.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in global disruptions within healthcare systems, leading to quick dynamic fluctuations in hospital operations and supply chain management. During the early months of the pandemic, tertiary multihospital systems were highly viewed as the go-to hospitals for handling these rapid healthcare challenges caused by the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases. Yet, this pandemic has created an urgent need for coordinated mechanisms to alleviate increasing pressures on these large multihospital systems and ensure services remain high-quality, accessible, and sustainable. Digital health solutions have been identified as promising approaches to address these challenges. This case report describes results for developing multidisciplinary visualizations to support digital health operations in one of the largest tertiary multihospital systems in the Middle East. The report concludes with some lessons and insights learned from the rapid development and delivery of this user-centric COVID-19 multihospital operations intelligent platform.",

    "abstract": "The early detection of carotid wall plaque is recommended in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in moderate-risk patients. Previous techniques for B-mode carotid atherosclerotic wall plaque segmentation used artificial intelligence (AI) methods on monoethnic databases, where training and testing are from the \"same\" ethnic group (\"Seen AI\"). Therefore, the versatility of the system is questionable. This is the first study of its kind that uses the \"Unseen AI\" paradigm where training and testing are from \"different\" ethnic groups. We hypothesized that deep learning (DL) models should perform in 10% proximity between \"Unseen AI\" and \"Seen AI\".\nTwo cohorts from multi-ethnic groups (330 Japanese and 300 Hong Kong (HK)) were used for the validation of our hypothesis. We used a four-layered UNet architecture for the segmentation of the atherosclerotic wall with low plaque. \"Unseen AI\" (training: Japanese, testing: HK or vice versa) and \"Seen AI\" experiments (single ethnicity or mixed ethnicity) were performed. Evaluation was conducted by measuring the wall plaque area. Statistical tests were conducted for its stability and reliability.\nWhen using the UNet DL architecture, the \"Unseen AI\" pair one (Training: 330 Japanese and Testing: 300 HK), the mean accuracy, dice-similarity, and correlation-coefficient were 98.55, 78.38, and 0.80 (\nWe demonstrated that \"Unseen AI\" was in close proximity (<10%) to \"Seen AI\", validating our DL model for low atherosclerotic wall plaque segmentation.

    "abstract": "Our systematic review investigated the additional effect of artificial intelligence-based devices on human observers when diagnosing and/or detecting thoracic pathologies using different diagnostic imaging modalities, such as chest X-ray and CT. Peer-reviewed, original research articles from EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane library, SCOPUS, and Web of Science were retrieved. Included articles were published within the last 20 years and used a device based on artificial intelligence (AI) technology to detect or diagnose pulmonary findings. The AI-based device had to be used in an observer test where the performance of human observers with and without addition of the device was measured as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, AUC, or time spent on image reading. A total of 38 studies were included for final assessment. The quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) was used for bias assessment. The average sensitivity increased from 67.8% to 74.6%; specificity from 82.2% to 85.4%; accuracy from 75.4% to 81.7%; and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) from 0.75 to 0.80. Generally, a faster reading time was reported when radiologists were aided by AI-based devices. Our systematic review showed that performance generally improved for the physicians when assisted by AI-based devices compared to unaided interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) is widely used to evaluate growth potential in the field of orthodontics. This study is aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system to automatically determine the CVM status and evaluate the AI performance.\nA total of 1080 cephalometric radiographs, with the age of patients ranging from 6 to 22 years old, were included in the dataset (980 in training dataset and 100 in testing dataset). Two reference points and thirteen anatomical points were labelled and the cervical vertebral maturation staging (CS) was assessed by human examiners as gold standard. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model was built to train on 980 images and to test on 100 images. Statistical analysis was conducted to detect labelling differences between AI and human examiners, AI performance was also evaluated.\nThe mean labelling error between human examiners was 0.48 \u00b1 0.12 mm. The mean labelling error between AI and human examiners was 0.36 \u00b1 0.09 mm. In general, the agreement between AI results and the gold standard was good, with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value being up to 98%. Moreover, the accuracy of CVM staging was 71%. In terms of F1 score, CS6 stage (85%) ranked the highest accuracy.\nIn this study, AI showed a good agreement with human examiners, being a useful and reliable tool in assessing the cervical vertebral maturation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the impact of oral health on adolescent quality of life and to compare the results obtained using standard statistical methods and artificial intelligence algorithms. In order to measure the impact of oral health on adolescent quality of life, a validated Serbian version of the Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP) scale was used. The total sample comprised 374 respondents. The obtained results were processed using standard statistical methods and machine learning, i.e., artificial intelligence algorithms-singular value decomposition. OIDP score was dichotomized into two categories depending on whether the respondents had or did not have oral or teeth problems affecting their life quality. Human intuition and machine algorithms came to the same conclusion on how the respondents should be divided. As such, method quality and the need to perform analyses of this type in dentistry studies were demonstrated. Using artificial intelligence algorithms, the respondents can be clustered into characteristic groups that allow the discovery of details not possible with the intuitive division of respondents by gender.",

    "abstract": "Neurodiagnostic investigation requirements are expanding for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in children, especially in those with developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID). Thus, determination of optimal sedatives to achieve successful sedation and immobility without further neurological compromise is important in children with DD/ID. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and adverse reactions of chloral hydrate (CH) for brain magnetic resonance imaging (B-MRI) in children with DD/ID compared to those with normal intelligence (NI). We performed a retrospective chart review of children aged from 1 day to 12 years who required elective sedation using CH for B-MRI. About 730 cases (415 with DD/ID and 315 with NI) of CH sedation were conducted for B-MRI. Children with DD/ID showed a higher failure rate (22%) than did those with NI (6%); additional CH and prolonged sedation time were required. There was no difference in incidence of adverse reactions between DD/ID and NI groups (",

    "abstract": "As costs decline and technology inevitably improves, current trends suggest that artificial intelligence (AI) and a variety of \"carebots\" will increasingly be adopted in medical care. Medical ethicists have long expressed concerns that such technologies remove the human element from medicine, resulting in dehumanization and depersonalized care. However, we argue that where shame presents a barrier to medical care, it is sometimes ethically permissible and even desirable to deploy AI/carebots because (i) dehumanization in medicine is not always morally wrong, and (ii) dehumanization can sometimes better promote and protect important medical values. Shame is often a consequence of the human-to-human element of medical care and can prevent patients from seeking treatment and from disclosing important information to their healthcare provider. Conditions and treatments that are shame-inducing offer opportunities for introducing AI/carebots in a manner that removes the human element of medicine but does so ethically. We outline numerous examples of shame-inducing interactions and how they are overcome by implementing existing and expected developments of AI/carebot technology that remove the human element from care.",

    "abstract": "Blocklisting malicious activities in health care is challenging in relation to access control in health care security practices due to the fear of preventing legitimate access for therapeutic reasons. Inadvertent prevention of legitimate access can contravene the availability trait of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability triad, and may result in worsening health conditions, leading to serious consequences, including deaths. Therefore, health care staff are often provided with a wide range of access such as a \"breaking-the-glass\" or \"self-authorization\" mechanism for emergency access. However, this broad access can undermine the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive health care data because breaking-the-glass can lead to vast unauthorized access, which could be problematic when determining illegitimate access in security practices.\nA review was performed to pinpoint appropriate artificial intelligence (AI) methods and data sources that can be used for effective modeling and analysis of health care staff security practices. Based on knowledge obtained from the review, a framework was developed and implemented with simulated data to provide a comprehensive approach toward effective modeling and analyzing security practices of health care staff in real access logs.\nThe flow of our approach was a mapping review to provide AI methods, data sources and their attributes, along with other categories as input for framework development. To assess implementation of the framework, electronic health record (EHR) log data were simulated and analyzed, and the performance of various approaches in the framework was compared.\nAmong the total 130 articles initially identified, 18 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A thorough assessment and analysis of the included articles revealed that K-nearest neighbor, Bayesian network, and decision tree (C4.5) algorithms were predominantly applied to EHR and network logs with varying input features of health care staff security practices. Based on the review results, a framework was developed and implemented with simulated logs. The decision tree obtained the best precision of 0.655, whereas the best recall was achieved by the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm at 0.977. However, the best F1-score was obtained by random forest at 0.775. In brief, three classifiers (random forest, decision tree, and SVM) in the two-class approach achieved the best precision of 0.998.\nThe security practices of health care staff can be effectively analyzed using a two-class approach to detect malicious and nonmalicious security practices. Based on our comparative study, the algorithms that can effectively be used in related studies include random forest, decision tree, and SVM. Deviations of security practices from required health care staff's security behavior in the big data context can be analyzed with real access logs to define appropriate incentives for improving conscious care security practice.",

    "abstract": "Chuna manual therapy (CMT) is a type of manual medicine practiced by Korean medical doctors in South Korea. Spinal diagnosis in CMT uses a system that applies manual diagnostic and X-ray tests to detect specific vertebral malpositions, based on the relative alignment across vertebral bodies. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) programs have been developed to assist in the radiological diagnosis of CMT using X-ray images. Nevertheless, a few clinical studies have reported on the concordance between diagnosticians, diagnostics methodologies, and the use of AI programs for diagnosing CMT. At present, the evidence to support CMT diagnosis is insufficient. This study thus aims to overcome such limitations by collecting and comparing CMT diagnostic data from experts and non-experts through manual diagnosis, X-ray test, and images obtained using an AI program. The study aims to search for CMT diagnosis methods with more outstanding rationality and consistency and to explore the potential use of AI-based CMT diagnosis programs.\nThis study will be conducted as an exploratory, cross-sectional, prospective observational study that will recruit 100 non-specialist subjects. Each subject will submit a signed consent after the screening test and undergo L-spine standing AP & lateral X-ray imaging. Manual CMT diagnosis will be performed by 3 CMT experts according to the standard operation procedure (SOP). The X-ray images of the 100 subjects will subsequently be used to make the CMT radiological diagnoses according to the same SOP by the CMT expert group (n\u200a=\u200a3) and CMT non-expert group (n\u200a=\u200a3). Among the subjects, those in the non-expert group will receive another CMT radiological diagnosis with spinal data obtained using the AI program, approximately 1\u200amonth from after initial diagnosis.Based on the collected diagnostic data, within- and between-group concordance levels will be assessed for each diagnostic method. The verified level of concordance will be used to test the potential use of CMT diagnostic method and CMT AI programs with high levels of rationality and consistency.\nThis trial has received complete ethical approval from the Wonkwang University Korean Medicine Hospital (IRB 2021-8). We intend to submit the results of the trial to a peer-reviewed journal and/or conferences.\nhttps://cris.nih.go.kr/cris/search/detailSearch.do?search_lang=E&search_page=M&pageSize=10&page=undefined&seq=20613&status=5&seq_group=20613, Identifier: KCT0006707.",

    "abstract": "Next generation sequencing generates copious amounts of genomics data, causing manual interpretation to be laborious and non-scalable while remaining subjective (even for highly trained specialists). We evaluated the performance of the artificial intelligence-based offering Watson for Genomics (WfG), a variant interpretation platform, in hematologic malignancies for the first time.Next generation sequencing was performed for patients treated for various hematological malignancies at Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, South Korea, between December 2017 and August 2020 using a 54-gene panel. Both WfG and expert manual curation were used to evaluate the performance of WfG. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) molecular profiles were compared between Koreans and other ethnic groups using a publicly available dataset.Seventy-seven patients were analyzed (AML: 45, myeloproliferative neoplasms: 12, multiple myeloma: 7, myelodysplastic syndromes: 6, and others: 7). The concordance between the manual and WfG interpretations of 35 variants in 11 random patients was 94%. Among all patients, WfG identified 39 (51%) with at least 1 clinically actionable therapeutic alteration (i.e., a variant targeted by a United States Food and Drug Administration [US FDA]-approved drug, off-label drug, or clinical trial). Moreover, 46% of these patients (18/39) had genes that were targeted by a US FDA-approved therapy. WfG identified diagnostic or prognostic insights in 65% of the patients with no targetable alterations. In those with AML, FLT3-internal tandem duplications or tyrosine kinase domain mutations were less frequent among Koreans than among Caucasians (6.7% vs 30.2%, P\u200a<\u200a.001) or Hispanics (6.7% vs 28.3%, P\u200a=\u200a.005), suggesting ethnic differences.Variant interpretation using WfG correlated well with manually curated expert opinions. WfG provided therapeutic insights (including variant-specific drugs and clinical trials that cannot easily be provided by expert manual curation), as well as diagnostic and/or prognostic information.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this retrospective study is to assess any association between abdominal CT findings and the radiological stage of COVID-19 pneumonia, pulmonary embolism and patient outcomes. We included 158 adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients between 1 March 2020 and 1 March 2021 who underwent 206 abdominal CTs. Two radiologists reviewed all CT images. Pathological findings were classified as acute or not. A subset of patients with inflammatory pathology in ACE2 organs (bowel, biliary tract, pancreas, urinary system) was identified. The radiological stage of COVID pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, overall days of hospitalization, ICU admission and outcome were registered. Univariate statistical analysis coupled with explainable artificial intelligence (AI) techniques were used to discover associations between variables. The most frequent acute findings were bowel abnormalities (",

Practical intelligence rises in value relative to abstract intelligence; and 2. social intelligence shifts from measuring how well individuals can negotiate the social world to achieve their personal aims to measuring how well they can do so to achieve group aims. We document these shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic and argue that they led to an increase in the size and strength of social movements.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the advantages of viewing intelligence not as a fixed trait residing within an individual, but rather as a person \u00d7 task \u00d7 situation interaction. The emphasis in the article is on the role of persons solving tasks embedded in situations involving learning, intellectual abilities, and competencies. The article opens with a consideration of the role of situations in intelligent behavior. The article then discusses how intelligence is more similar to creativity and wisdom, in terms of the role of situations, than many psychologists have realized. Then the article reviews the role of situations in identity-based and irrational thinking and in conspiratorial thinking and cults. Next the article discusses the demonstrated importance of situations in assessment, but also notes the difficulties in sampling situations. Finally, the article draws conclusions, in particular, that, given our lack of situation-based tests, we need to be more modest in our interpretations results from conventional tests of intelligence.",

    "abstract": "In the US, undeniable evidence shows that socioeconomic inequities explain a high proportion of individual differences in school achievement. Although not all countries show this same effect due to socioeconomic status, it is consistently found that social inequities lead to achievement gaps. These achievement gaps then manifest into trajectories that set some individuals on a path of lower incomes, poorer health and higher mortality, lower wellbeing, and other poor adult outcomes. Like James Flynn so handily reminded the scientific literature that achievement gaps are explainable by environmental factors, the inequities we see around the world are based on environments some children are exposed to. In his work, Flynn stated his belief that the suppression of scientific work on intelligence would continue to lead to social inequities. We wish to take this idea and move it forward. We believe that the scientific construct of intelligence plays a key role in helping create a more equitable society through science. We also believe that the poor perception of intelligence, rooted in historical realities, means that it will continue to be misunderstood, feared, and misused, limiting how effective it could be in helping to close gaps in achievement and in creating a more equitable society.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are starting to be used in IVF, in particular for selecting which embryos to transfer to the woman. AI has the potential to process complex data sets, to be better at identifying subtle but important patterns, and to be more objective than humans when evaluating embryos. However, a current review of the literature shows much work is still needed before AI can be ethically implemented for this purpose. No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published, and the efficacy studies which exist demonstrate that algorithms can broadly differentiate well between 'good-' and 'poor-' quality embryos but not necessarily between embryos of similar quality, which is the actual clinical need. Almost universally, the AI models were opaque ('black-box') in that at least some part of the process was uninterpretable. This gives rise to a number of epistemic and ethical concerns, including problems with trust, the possibility of using algorithms that generalize poorly to different populations, adverse economic implications for IVF clinics, potential misrepresentation of patient values, broader societal implications, a responsibility gap in the case of poor selection choices and introduction of a more paternalistic decision-making process. Use of interpretable models, which are constrained so that a human can easily understand and explain them, could overcome these concerns. The contribution of AI to IVF is potentially significant, but we recommend that AI models used in this field should be interpretable, and rigorously evaluated with RCTs before implementation. We also recommend long-term follow-up of children born after AI for embryo selection, regulatory oversight for implementation, and public availability of data and code to enable research teams to independently reproduce and validate existing models.",

    "abstract": "With the progress of science and technology, artificial intelligence represented by deep learning has gradually begun to be applied in the medical field. Artificial intelligence has been applied to benign gastrointestinal lesions, tumors, early cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, gallbladder, pancreas, and other diseases. This review summarizes the latest research results on artificial intelligence in digestive endoscopy and discusses the prospect of artificial intelligence in digestive system diseases.\nWe retrieved relevant documents on artificial intelligence in digestive tract diseases from PubMed and Medline. This review elaborates on the knowledge of computer-aided diagnosis in digestive endoscopy.\nArtificial intelligence significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, reduces physicians' workload, and provides a shred of evidence for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Shortly, artificial intelligence will have high application value in the field of medicine.",

    "abstract": "The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) eighth edition schema for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treats T and N stage as independent factors and uses positive lymph nodes (PLNs) to define N stage, despite data favoring lymph node ratio (LNR). We used artificial intelligence-based techniques to compare PLN with LNR and investigate interactions between tumor size and nodal status.\nPatients who underwent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma resection between 2000 and 2017 at six institutions were identified. LNR and PLN were compared through shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis, with the best predictor used to define nodal status. We trained optimal classification trees (OCTs) to predict 1-year and 3-year risk of death, incorporating only tumor size and nodal status as variables. The OCTs were compared with the AJCC schema and similarly trained XGBoost models. Variable interactions were explored via SHAP.\nTwo thousand eight hundred seventy-four patients comprised the derivation and 1,231 the validation cohort. SHAP identified LNR as a superior predictor. The OCTs outperformed the AJCC schema in the derivation and validation cohorts (1-year area under the curve: 0.681 \nOur findings highlight the superiority of LNR and the importance of interactions between tumor size and nodal status. These results and the potential of the OCT methodology to combine them into a powerful, visually interpretable model can help inform future staging systems.",

    "abstract": "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) not only yields in advantages for healthcare but raises several ethical questions. Extant research on ethical considerations of AI in digital health is quite sparse and a holistic overview is lacking. A systematic literature review searching across 853 peer-reviewed journals and conferences yielded in 50 relevant articles categorized in five major ethical principles: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability. The ethical landscape of AI in digital health is portrayed including a snapshot guiding future development. The status quo highlights potential areas with little empirical but required research. Less explored areas with remaining ethical questions are validated and guide scholars' efforts by outlining an overview of addressed ethical principles and intensity of studies including correlations. Practitioners understand novel questions AI raises eventually leading to properly regulated implementations and further comprehend that society is on its way from supporting technologies to autonomous decision-making systems.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of sectors are delivering customer services powered by artificial intelligence (AI) instead of humans, with evidence indicating labor cost reduction and efficiency improvement. However, it would be worthwhile to examine the extent to which consumers are satisfied with AI service agents. In two studies based on an analysis of 17,673 Weibo data (Study 1) and 33 interviews (Study 2), we constructed a pair of theoretical models of consumer attitudes toward AI services: a sentiment model and an evaluation model. The results from Weibo data analysis showed that consumers display a stronger negative attitude toward AI customer service than toward their human counterparts. Complaints regarding AI customer service is mainly about its poor problem-solving ability, while untimely response and lack of human touch also dissatisfy customers. Whether consumers offer positive feedback mainly depends on voice traits and service attitudes. The results from the interviews confirm an overall negative attitude of consumers toward AI customer service. Consumers also recognize AI customer service agents as human like and social interaction stress relieving. Taken together, these findings reveal Chinese customers' attitudes toward AI service solutions and provide concrete suggestions for the development and upgrade of AI customer services.",

However, there are reasons why the antiquated measurement of medical impairment continues to be in use. We propose solutions for a fairer process using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) at the level of the medical boards augmented by telemedicine and artificial intelligence (AI). The proposed technologies (Level 1 and Level 2 AI) need to be tried in pilot projects. It will accomplish two goals, the first being the measurement of disability and not merely the impairment.

    "abstract": "Nanophotonics inverse design is a rapidly expanding research field whose goal is to focus users on defining complex, high-level optical functionalities while leveraging machines to search for the required material and geometry configurations in sub-wavelength structures. The journey of inverse design begins with traditional optimization tools such as topology optimization and heuristics methods, including simulated annealing, swarm optimization, and genetic algorithms. Recently, the blossoming of deep learning in various areas of data-driven science and engineering has begun to permeate nanophotonics inverse design intensely. This review discusses state-of-the-art optimizations methods, deep learning, and more recent hybrid techniques, analyzing the advantages, challenges, and perspectives of inverse design both as a science and an engineering.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies in adults showed heterogeneous results regarding the associations of personality with intelligence and executive functions (EF). In children, there is a lack of studies investigating the relations between personality and EF. Therefore, the aim of our study was to examine the relations between the Big Five personality traits, EF, and intelligence in a sample of children (Experiment 1) and young adults (Experiment 2). A total of 155 children (Experiment 1, mean age\u2009=\u20099.54\u00a0years) and 91 young adults (Experiment 2, mean age\u2009=\u200923.49\u00a0years) participated in the two studies. In both studies, participants performed tasks measuring working memory (WM), inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, and fluid intelligence and completed a personality questionnaire. In Experiment 1, we found a negative relation between neuroticism and intelligence. In Experiment 2, we found a positive relation between conscientiousness and intelligence and a positive relation between conscientiousness and cognitive flexibility. Our results suggest a complex interplay between personality factors, EF, and intelligence both in children as well as in young adults.",

    "abstract": "Background Missed fractures are a common cause of diagnostic discrepancy between initial radiographic interpretation and the final read by board-certified radiologists. Purpose To assess the effect of assistance by artificial intelligence (AI) on diagnostic performances of physicians for fractures on radiographs. Materials and Methods This retrospective diagnostic study used the multi-reader, multi-case methodology based on an external multicenter data set of 480 examinations with at least 60 examinations per body region (foot and ankle, knee and leg, hip and pelvis, hand and wrist, elbow and arm, shoulder and clavicle, rib cage, and thoracolumbar spine) between July 2020 and January 2021. Fracture prevalence was set at 50%. The ground truth was determined by two musculoskeletal radiologists, with discrepancies solved by a third. Twenty-four readers (radiologists, orthopedists, emergency physicians, physician assistants, rheumatologists, family physicians) were presented the whole validation data set (",

    "abstract": "Systematic reviews are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine. However, systematic reviews are time consuming and there is growing demand to produce evidence more quickly, while maintaining robust methods. In recent years, artificial intelligence and active-machine learning (AML) have been implemented into several SR software applications. As some of the barriers to adoption of new technologies are the challenges in set-up and how best to use these technologies, we have provided different situations and considerations for knowledge synthesis teams to consider when using artificial intelligence and AML for title and abstract screening.\nWe retrospectively evaluated the implementation and performance of AML across a set of ten historically completed systematic reviews. Based upon the findings from this work and in consideration of the barriers we have encountered and navigated during the past 24\u2009months in using these tools prospectively in our research, we discussed and developed a series of practical recommendations for research teams to consider in seeking to implement AML tools for citation screening into their workflow.\nWe developed a seven-step framework and provide guidance for when and how to integrate artificial intelligence and AML into the title and abstract screening process. Steps include: (1) Consulting with Knowledge user/Expert Panel; (2) Developing the search strategy; (3) Preparing your review team; (4) Preparing your database; (5) Building the initial training set; (6) Ongoing screening; and (7) Truncating screening. During Step 6 and/or 7, you may also choose to optimize your team, by shifting some members to other review stages (e.g., full-text screening, data extraction).\nArtificial intelligence and, more specifically, AML are well-developed tools for title and abstract screening and can be integrated into the screening process in several ways. Regardless of the method chosen, transparent reporting of these methods is critical for future studies evaluating artificial intelligence and AML.",

    "abstract": "This research aims to know the influence of fluoride in drinking water towards Fluorosis and the Intelligence Level of Elementary School Students in Palu City.\nThis cross-sectional study was performed through descriptive analysis on 100 students aged 6-12 years old selected by stratified random sampling from two different areas with different levels of fluoride in drinking water in Palu City. The samples were collected from two different elementary schools which were SDN 2 Talise and SDN Inpres 1 Birobuli. The examination was performed by a dentist using Dean's Fluorosis Index and philology, who measured students' IQ using Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices.\nHigh level of F in drinking water affects the fluorosis status of students (p=0.001), in which among 40 students (40%) who experienced fluorosis, 38 (38%) of them are from the area whose F level is high. The high level of F also affected the children's IQ, obtaining a p-value of 0.001, showing that there were no students with low IQ found in the area with low F level. For the status of Fluorosis and IQ, p=0.001 was obtained. Among the 60 students who did not experience fluorosis, 96.6% of them had a high IQ level.\nThe recent research found that fluorosis was found more often in the area of which F level was high, where the IQ level of the students was found to be lower compared to the students who loved in the area with low F level.",

    "abstract": "Adenoma detection rate is the crucial parameter for colorectal cancer screening. Increasing the field of view with additional side optics has been reported to detect flat adenomas hidden behind folds. Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) has also recently been introduced to detect more adenomas. We therefore aimed to combine both technologies in a new prototypic colonoscopy concept.\nA 3-dimensional-printed cap including 2 microcameras was attached to a conventional endoscope. The prototype was applied in 8 gene-targeted pigs with mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene. The first 4 animals were used to train an AI system based on the images generated by microcameras. Thereafter, the conceptual prototype for detecting adenomas was tested in a further series of 4 pigs.\nUsing our prototype, we detected, with side optics, adenomas that might have been missed conventionally. Furthermore, the newly developed AI could detect, mark, and present adenomas visualized with side optics outside of the conventional field of view.\nCombining AI with side optics might help detect adenomas that otherwise might have been missed.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize society by automating tasks as diverse as driving cars, diagnosing diseases, and providing legal advice. The degree to which AI can improve outcomes in these and other domains depends on how comfortable people are trusting AI for these tasks, which in turn depends on lay perceptions of AI. The present research examines how these critical lay perceptions may vary as a function of conservatism. Using five survey experiments, we find that political conservatism is associated with low comfort with and trust in AI-i.e., with AI aversion. This relationship between conservatism and AI aversion is explained by the link between conservatism and risk perception; more conservative individuals perceive AI as being riskier and are therefore more averse to its adoption. Finally, we test whether a moral reframing intervention can reduce AI aversion among conservatives.",

    "abstract": "AI is a broad concept, grouping initiatives that use a computer to perform tasks that would usually require a human to complete. AI methods are well suited to predict clinical outcomes. In practice, AI methods can be thought of as functions that learn the outcomes accompanying standardized input data to produce accurate outcome predictions when trialed with new data. Current methods for cleaning, creating, accessing, extracting, augmenting, and representing data for training AI clinical prediction models are well defined. The use of AI to predict clinical outcomes is a dynamic and rapidly evolving arena, with new methods and applications emerging. Extraction or accession of electronic health care records and combining these with patient genetic data is an area of present attention, with tremendous potential for future growth. Machine learning approaches, including decision tree methods of Random Forest and XGBoost, and deep learning techniques including deep multi-layer and recurrent neural networks, afford unique capabilities to accurately create predictions from high dimensional, multimodal data. Furthermore, AI methods are increasing our ability to accurately predict clinical outcomes that previously were difficult to model, including time-dependent and multi-class outcomes. Barriers to robust AI-based clinical outcome model deployment include changing AI product development interfaces, the specificity of regulation requirements, and limitations in ensuring model interpretability, generalizability, and adaptability over time.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac arrest is a life-threatening cessation of activity in the heart. Early prediction of cardiac arrest is important, as it allows for the necessary measures to be taken to prevent or intervene during the onset. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and big data have been increasingly used to enhance the ability to predict and prepare for the patients at risk.\nThis study aims to explore the use of AI technology in predicting cardiac arrest as reported in the literature.\nA scoping review was conducted in line with the guidelines of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for scoping reviews. Scopus, ScienceDirect, Embase, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and Google Scholar were searched to identify relevant studies. Backward reference list checks of the included studies were also conducted. Study selection and data extraction were independently conducted by 2 reviewers. Data extracted from the included studies were synthesized narratively.\nOut of 697 citations retrieved, 41 studies were included in the review, and 6 were added after backward citation checking. The included studies reported the use of AI in the prediction of cardiac arrest. Of the 47 studies, we were able to classify the approaches taken by the studies into 3 different categories: 26 (55%) studies predicted cardiac arrest by analyzing specific parameters or variables of the patients, whereas 16 (34%) studies developed an AI-based warning system. The remaining 11% (5/47) of studies focused on distinguishing patients at high risk of cardiac arrest from patients who were not at risk. Two studies focused on the pediatric population, and the rest focused on adults (45/47, 96%). Most of the studies used data sets with a size of <10,000 samples (32/47, 68%). Machine learning models were the most prominent branch of AI used in the prediction of cardiac arrest in the studies (38/47, 81%), and the most used algorithm was the neural network (23/47, 49%). K-fold cross-validation was the most used algorithm evaluation tool reported in the studies (24/47, 51%).\nAI is extensively used to predict cardiac arrest in different patient settings. Technology is expected to play an integral role in improving cardiac medicine. There is a need for more reviews to learn the obstacles to the implementation of AI technologies in clinical settings. Moreover, research focusing on how to best provide clinicians with support to understand, adapt, and implement this technology in their practice is also necessary.",

The included studies reported the use of AI in the prediction of cardiac arrest. Of the 47 studies, we were able to classify the approaches taken by the studies into 3 different categories: 26 (55%) studies predicted cardiac arrest by analyzing specific parameters or variables of the patients, whereas 16 (34%) studies developed an AI-based warning system. The remaining 11% (5/47) of studies focused on distinguishing patients at high risk of cardiac arrest from patients who were not at risk. Two studies focused on the pediatric population, and the rest focused on adults (45/47, 96%). Most of the studies used data sets with a size of <10,000 samples (32/47, 68%). Machine learning models were the most prominent branch of AI used in the prediction of cardiac arrest in the studies (38/47, 81%), and the most used algorithm was the neural network (23/47, 49%). K-fold cross-validation was the most used algorithm evaluation tool reported in the studies (24/47, 51%).",

    "abstract": "The immunohistochemical method serves as one of the most practical tools in clinical cancer detection and thus has great application value to overcome the existing limits of the conventional method and further improve the detecting efficiency and sensitivity. This study employed 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB), a conventional color indicator for immunohistochemistry, as a novel high-sensitive scattering reagent to provide a multidimensional image signal varying with the overexpression rate of tumor markers. Based on the scattering properties of DAB aggregates, an efficient and robust artificial intelligence-aided immunohistochemical method based on dark-field imaging has been established, with improvement in both the imaging quality and interpretation efficiency in comparison with the conventional manual-operated immunohistochemical method. Referencing the diagnosis from three independent pathologists, this method succeeded in detecting HER2 overexpressed breast tumors with a sensitivity of 95.2% and a specificity of 100.0%; meanwhile, it was found to be applicable for non-small-cell lung tumors and malignant lymphoma as well. As demonstrated, this study provided an effective and reliable means for making diagnostic suggestions, which exhibited great potential in multiple tumor pathological detection at low cost.",

    "abstract": "As in other areas, artificial intelligence (AI) is heavily promoted in different scientific fields, including chemistry. Although chemistry traditionally tends to be a conservative field and slower than others to adapt new concepts, AI is increasingly being investigated across chemical disciplines. In medicinal chemistry, supported by computer-aided drug design and cheminformatics, computational methods have long been employed to aid in the search for and optimization of active compounds. We are currently witnessing a multitude of AI-related publications in the medicinal-chemistry-relevant literature and anticipate that the numbers will further increase. Often, advances through AI promoted in such reports are difficult to reconcile or remain questionable, which hampers the acceptance of computational work in interdisciplinary environments. Herein we attempt to highlight selected investigations in which AI has shown promise to impact medicinal chemistry in areas such as compound design and synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Built on the foundation of the randomized controlled trial (RCT), Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) is at its best when optimizing outcomes for homogeneous cohorts of patients like those participating in an RCT. Its weakness is a failure to resolve a clinical quandary: patients appear for care individually, each may differ in important ways from an RCT cohort, and the physician will wonder each time if following EBM will provide best guidance for this unique patient. In an effort to overcome this weakness, and promote higher quality care through a more personalized approach, a new framework has been proposed: Medicine-Based Evidence (MBE). In this approach, big data and deep learning techniques are embraced to interrogate treatment responses among patients in real-world clinical practice. Such statistical models are then integrated with mechanistic disease models to construct a \"digital twin,\" which serves as the real-time digital counterpart of a patient. MBE is thereby capable of dynamically modeling the effects of various treatment decisions in the context of an individual's specific characteristics. In this article, we discuss how MBE could benefit patients with congenital heart disease, a field where RCTs are difficult to conduct and often fail to provide definitive solutions because of a small number of subjects, their clinical complexity, and heterogeneity. We will also highlight the challenges that must be addressed before MBE can be embraced in clinical practice and its full potential can be realized.",

    "abstract": "To assist with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) screening, artificial intelligence (AI) methods based on deep learning (DL) have been developed to alleviate the pressure experienced by ophthalmologists and discover and treat RVO as early as possible.\nA total of 8600 color fundus photographs (CFPs) were included for training, validation, and testing of disease recognition models and lesion segmentation models. Four disease recognition and four lesion segmentation models were established and compared. Finally, one disease recognition model and one lesion segmentation model were selected as superior. Additionally, 224 CFPs from 130 patients were included as an external test set to determine the abilities of the two selected models.\nUsing the Inception-v3 model for disease identification, the mean sensitivity, specificity, and F1 for the three disease types and normal CFPs were 0.93, 0.99, and 0.95, respectively, and the mean area under the curve (AUC) was 0.99. Using the DeepLab-v3 model for lesion segmentation, the mean sensitivity, specificity, and F1 for four lesion types (abnormally dilated and tortuous blood vessels, cotton-wool spots, flame-shaped hemorrhages, and hard exudates) were 0.74, 0.97, and 0.83, respectively.\nDL models show good performance when recognizing RVO and identifying lesions using CFPs. Because of the increasing number of RVO patients and increasing demand for trained ophthalmologists, DL models will be helpful for diagnosing RVO early in life and reducing vision impairment.",

    "abstract": "In neuro-oncology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critically important, non-invasive radiologic assessment technique for brain tumor diagnosis, especially glioma. Deep learning improves MRI image characterization and interpretation through the utilization of raw imaging data and provides unprecedented enhancement of images and representation for detection and classification through deep neural networks. This systematic review and quality appraisal method aim to summarize deep learning approaches used in neuro-oncology imaging to aid healthcare professionals. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a total of 20 low-risk studies on the established use of deep learning models to identify glioma genetic mutations and grading were selected, based on a Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 score of \u22659. The included studies provided the deep learning models used alongside their outcome measures, the number of patients, and the molecular markers for brain glioma classification. In 19 studies, the researchers determined that the deep learning model improved the clinical outcome and treatment protocol in patients with a brain tumor. In five studies, the authors determined the sensitivity of the deep learning model used, and\u00a0in four studies, the authors determined the specificity of the models. Convolutional neural network models were used in 16 studies. In eight studies, the researchers examined glioma grading by using different deep learning models compared with other models. In this review, we found that deep learning models significantly improve the diagnostic and classification accuracy of brain tumors, particularly gliomas without the need for invasive methods. Most studies have presented validated results and can be used in clinical practice to improve patient care and prognosis.",

    "abstract": "The artificial intelligence algorithm was used to analyze the characteristics of computed tomography (CT) images before and after interventional treatment of children's lymphangioma. Retrospective analysis was performed, and 30 children with lymphangioma from the hospital were recruited as the study subjects. The ultrasound-guided bleomycin interventional therapy was adopted and applied to CT scanning through convolutional neural network (CNN). The CT imaging-related indicators before and after interventional therapy were detected, and feature analysis was performed. In addition, the CNN algorithm was adopted to segment the image of the tumor was clearer and more accurate. At the same time, the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of the CNN algorithm was 0.9, which had a higher degree of agreement. In terms of clinical symptoms, the cured children's lesions disappeared, the skin surface returned to normal color, and the treatment was smooth. In the two cases with effective treatment, the cystic mass at the lesion site was significantly smaller, and the nodules disappeared. CT images before interventional therapy showed that lymphangiomas in children were more common in the neck. The cystic masses at all lesion sites varied in diameter and size, and most of them were similar to round and irregular, with uniform density distribution. The boundary was clear, the cyst was solid, and there were different degrees of compression and spread to the surrounding structure. Most of them were polycystic, and a few of them were single cystic. After interventional treatment, CT images showed that 27 cases of cured children's lymphangioma completely disappeared. Lymphangioma was significantly reduced in two children with effective treatment. Edema around the tumor also decreased significantly. Patients who did not respond to the treatment received interventional treatment again, and the tumors disappeared completely on CT imaging. No recurrence or new occurrence was found in three-month follow-up. The total effective rate of interventional therapy for lymphangioma in children was 96.67%. The CNN algorithm can effectively compare the CT image features before and after interventional treatment for children's lymphangioma. It was suggested that the artificial intelligence algorithm-aided CT imaging examination was helpful to guide physicians in the accurate treatment of children's lymphangioma.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies, AI algorithms are being embedded into various health information technologies that assist clinicians in clinical decision making.\nThis study aimed to explore how clinicians perceive AI assistance in diagnostic decision making and suggest the paths forward for AI-human teaming for clinical decision making in health care.\nThis study used a mixed methods approach, utilizing hierarchical linear modeling and sentiment analysis through natural language understanding techniques.\nA total of 114 clinicians participated in online simulation surveys in 2020 and 2021. These clinicians studied family medicine and used AI algorithms to aid in patient diagnosis. Their overall sentiment toward AI-assisted diagnosis was positive and comparable with diagnoses made without the assistance of AI. However, AI-guided decision making was not congruent with the way clinicians typically made decisions in diagnosing illnesses. In a quantitative survey, clinicians reported perceiving current AI assistance as not likely to enhance diagnostic capability and negatively influenced their overall performance (\u03b2=-0.421, P=.02). Instead, clinicians' diagnostic capabilities tended to be associated with well-known parameters, such as education, age, and daily habit of technology use on social media platforms.\nThis study elucidated clinicians' current perceptions and sentiments toward AI-enabled diagnosis. Although the sentiment was positive, the current form of AI assistance may not be linked with efficient decision making, as AI algorithms are not well aligned with subjective human reasoning in clinical diagnosis. Developers and policy makers in health could gather behavioral data from clinicians in various disciplines to help align AI algorithms with the unique subjective patterns of reasoning that humans employ in clinical diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Direct visual enumeration of viruses under dark-field microscope (DFM) using plasmon resonance probes (PRPs) is fast and convenient; however, it is greatly limited in the assay of real samples because of its inability to accurately identify false positives owing to non-specific adsorption. In this study, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted DFM enumeration strategy for the accurate assay of Enterovirus A71 (an ultra-small human virus) using two PRPs; a 40\u00a0nm silver nanoparticle probe (SNP) that appears bright blue under DFM, and a 120\u00a0nm gold nanorod probe (GNP) that appears red under DFM. The capture chip was prepared by immobilizing the SNPs with antibodies on the glass to capture the target virus and to form dichromatic sandwich structures with the GNPs, followed by imaging under a dark field (DF). Subsequently, the DF images of the capture chip were subjected to a two-step screening: first, using image processing, and thereafter using the AI algorithm screening to eliminate false positive results and background noise. The results revealed that the data from the AI-assisted dual PRPs assay were highly consistent with those of quantitative PCR (qPCR), and that the sensitivity with a minimum detectable concentration of 3 copies/\u03bcL was 5 times higher than that of qPCR. The entire analysis was completed within 45\u00a0min. Therefore, our AI-assisted virus enumeration strategy with two DF PRPs holds great potential for ultra-sensitive and accurate quantification of viruses in real samples.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has transformed the diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer and now plays an upfront role before prostate biopsies. If a suspicious lesion is found on MRI, the subsequent biopsy can be targeted. A sharp increase is expected in the number of men who will undergo prostate MRI. The challenge is to provide good image quality and diagnostic accuracy while meeting the demands of the expected higher workload. A possible solution to this challenge is to include a suitable risk stratification tool before imaging. Other solutions, such as smarter and shorter MRI protocols, need to be explored. For most of these solutions, artificial intelligence (AI) can play an important role. AI applications have the potential to improve the diagnostic quality of the prostate MRI pathway and speed up the work. PATIENT SUMMARY: The use of prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosis of prostate cancer is increasing. Risk stratification of patients before imaging and the use of shorter scan protocols can help in managing MRI resources. Artificial intelligence can also play a role in automating some tasks.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to establish whether an artificially intelligent (AI) system can be developed to automate stress echocardiography analysis and support clinician interpretation.\nCoronary artery disease is the leading global cause of mortality and morbidity and stress echocardiography remains one of the most commonly used diagnostic imaging tests.\nAn automated image processing pipeline was developed to extract novel geometric and kinematic features from stress echocardiograms collected as part of a large, United Kingdom-based prospective, multicenter, multivendor study. An ensemble machine learning classifier was trained, using the extracted features, to identify patients with severe coronary artery disease on invasive coronary angiography. The model was tested in an independent U.S.\nHow availability of an AI classification might impact clinical interpretation of stress echocardiograms was evaluated in a randomized crossover reader study.\nAcceptable classification accuracy for identification of patients with severe coronary artery disease in the training data set was achieved on cross-fold validation based on 31 unique geometric and kinematic features, with a specificity of 92.7% and a sensitivity of 84.4%. This accuracy was maintained in the independent validation data set. The use of the AI classification tool by clinicians increased inter-reader agreement and confidence as well as sensitivity for detection of disease by 10% to achieve an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.93.\nAutomated analysis of stress echocardiograms is possible using AI and provision of automated classifications to clinicians when reading stress echocardiograms could improve accuracy, inter-reader agreement, and reader confidence.",

    "abstract": "Modern artificial intelligence techniques have solved some previously intractable problems and produced impressive results in selected medical domains. One of their drawbacks is that they often need very large amounts of data. Pre-existing datasets in the form of national cancer registries, image/genetic depositories and clinical datasets already exist and have been used for research. In theory, the combination of healthcare Big Data with modern, data-hungry artificial intelligence techniques should offer significant opportunities for artificial intelligence development, but this has not yet happened. Here we discuss some of the structural reasons for this, barriers preventing artificial intelligence from making full use of existing datasets, and make suggestions as to enable progress. To do this, we use the framework of the 6Vs of Big Data and the FAIR criteria for data sharing and availability (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse). We share our experience in navigating these barriers through The Brain Tumour Data Accelerator, a Brain Tumour Charity-supported initiative to integrate fragmented patient data into an enriched dataset. We conclude with some comments as to the limits of such approaches.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates the application of empirical, statistical and machine learning methods to appraise the prediction of transmembrane pressure (TMP) by oscillating slotted pore membrane for the treatment of two kinds of deformable oil drops. Here, we utilized the previous experimental runs with permeate flux, shear rate and filtration time as features, while TMP of crude oil and Tween-20 were two distinct targets. For 87 experimental runs, Response surface methodology (RSM) and Artificial Neural network (ANN) modelling were opted as statistical and machine learning tools, respectively, which were comprehensively compared with empirical slot-pore blocking model (SBM) considering accuracy and generalization. ANN with 10 neurons in the hidden layer could approximate the TMP of both oils better than RSM and SBM, which is reflected by computed performance metrics. Under the given conditions, almost similar analysis were predicted for TMP of both oils except changes in magnitude which were interpreted by (1) line plots, which showed that TMP of crude oil and Tween-20 were linearly related to flux rate and filtration time, and there was an inverse relationship between TMP and shear rate, (2) contour plots, which illustrated the strong interaction effect of flux rate and time on TMP, and (3)- sensitivity analysis, which revealed the influential sequence of variables on TMP as; flux rate\u00a0>\u00a0filtration time\u00a0>\u00a0shear rate, for both cases. The optimisation of the process showed that minimum TMP can be attained by maintaining higher shear rate and lower flux rate and time. Conclusively, the current findings indicate the utilization of ANN for the accurate assessment of TMP and can be helpful for the process designing and scale up.",

    "abstract": "Air pollution is the existence of atmospheric chemicals damaging the health of human beings and other living organisms or damaging the environment or resources. Rarely any common contaminants are smog, nicotine, mold, yeast, biogas, or carbon dioxide. The paper will primarily observe, visualize and anticipate pollution levels. In particular, three algorithms of Artificial Intelligence were used to create good forecasting models and a predictive AQI model for 4 distinct gases: carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and atmospheric particulate matter. Thus, in this paper, the Air Qualification Index is developed utilizing Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and the Gradient Boosted Decision Tree GBDT Ensembles model over the next 5\u00a0h and analyzes air qualities using various sensors. The hypothesized artificial intelligence models are evaluated to the Root Mean Squares Error, Mean Squared Error and Mean absolute error, depending upon the performance measurements and a lower error value model is chosen. Based on the algorithm of the Artificial Intelligent System, the level of 5 air pollutants like CO2, SO2, NO2, PM 2.5 and PM10 can be predicted immediately by integrating the observations with errors. It may be used to detect air quality from distance in large cities and can assist lower the degree of environmental pollution.",

    "abstract": "To demonstrate the feasibility of an automated, non-invasive approach to estimate bone marrow (BM) infiltration of multiple myeloma (MM) by dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) after virtual non-calcium (VNCa) post-processing.\nIndividuals with MM and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) with concurrent DECT and BM biopsy between May 2018 and July 2020 were included in this retrospective observational study. Two pathologists and three radiologists reported BM infiltration and presence of osteolytic bone lesions, respectively. Bone mineral density (BMD) was quantified CT-based by a CE-certified software. Automated spine segmentation was implemented by a pre-trained convolutional neural network. The non-fatty portion of BM was defined as voxels\u2009>\u20090 HU in VNCa. For statistical assessment, multivariate regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were conducted.\nThirty-five patients (mean age 65\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u00a0years; 18 female) were evaluated. The non-fatty portion of BM significantly predicted BM infiltration after adjusting for the covariable BMD (p\u2009=\u20090.007, r\u2009=\u20090.46). A non-fatty portion of BM\u2009>\u20090.93% could anticipate osteolytic lesions and the clinical diagnosis of MM with an area under the ROC curve of 0.70 [0.49-0.90] and 0.71 [0.54-0.89], respectively. Our approach identified MM-patients without osteolytic lesions on conventional CT with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.63 and 0.71, respectively.\nAutomated, AI-supported attenuation assessment of the spine in DECT VNCa is feasible to predict BM infiltration in MM. Further, the proposed method might allow for pre-selecting patients with higher pre-test probability of osteolytic bone lesions and support the clinical diagnosis of MM without pathognomonic lesions on conventional CT.\n\u2022 The retrospective study provides an automated approach for quantification of the non-fatty portion of bone marrow, based on AI-supported spine segmentation and virtual non-calcium dual-energy CT data. \u2022 An increasing non-fatty portion of bone marrow is associated with a higher infiltration determined by invasive biopsy after adjusting for bone mineral density as a control variable (p\u2009=\u20090.007, r\u2009=\u20090.46). \u2022 The non-fatty portion of bone marrow might support the clinical diagnosis of multiple myeloma when conventional CT images are negative (sensitivity 0.63, specificity 0.71).",

    "abstract": "This study was aimed at comparing the conscientious intelligence levels of nursing students and determining the factors affecting their conscientious intelligence.\nTwo hundred and forty nursing students were involved in the study.\nThere were no\u00a0statistically significant differences between the first and fourth-year students in terms of the mean scores they obtained from the compassion, responsibility toward the creator, conscious awareness, and social sensitivity sub-dimensions. Of the students, those who chose the profession willingly, those who were women and those who did not perceive nursing as a profession just to earn money obtained higher mean scores in\u00a0the Conscientious Intelligence Scale.\nThe results of the study revealed that Nurse Academics should make more attempts to improve students' conscientious intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence system is a deep learning system based on computer-assisted ultrasonic image diagnosis, which can extract morphological features of breast mass and conduct objective and efficient image analysis, thus automatically intelligent classification of breast mass, avoiding subjective error and improving the accuracy of diagnosis.[1-2] A large number of studies have confirmed that artificial intelligence (AI) has high effectiveness and reliability in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant breast diseases.[3-4] However, the results of these studies have been contradictory. Therefore, this meta-analysis tested the hypothesis that artificial intelligence system is accurate in distinguishing benign and malignant breast diseases.\nWe will search PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Chinese biomedical databases from their inceptions to the November 20, 2021, without language restrictions. Two authors will independently carry out searching literature records, scanning titles and abstracts, full texts, collecting data, and assessing risk of bias. Review Manager 5.2 and Stata14.0 software will be used for data analysis.\nThis systematic review will determine the accuracy of AI in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant breast diseases.\nIts findings will provide helpful evidence for the accuracy of AI in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant breast diseases.\nINPLASY2021110087.",

    "abstract": "Treatment planning of radiotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer patients can be a time consuming process. Artificial intelligence based treatment planning could be used as a tool to speed up this process and maintain plan quality consistency. The purpose of this study was to create treatment plans for locally advanced breast cancer patients using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).\nData of 60 patients treated for left-sided breast cancer was used with a training, validation and test split of 36/12/12, respectively. The in-house built CNN model was a hierarchically densely connected U-net (HD U-net). The inputs for the HD U-net were 2D distance maps of the relevant regions of interest. Dose predictions, generated by the HD U-net, were used for a mimicking algorithm in order to create clinically deliverable plans.\nDose predictions were generated by the HD U-net and mimicked using a commercial treatment planning system. The predicted plans fulfilling all clinical goals while showing small (\u22640.5\u00a0Gy) statistically significant differences (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the doses compared to the manual plans. The mimicked plans show statistically significant differences in the average doses for the heart and lung of \u22640.5\u00a0Gy and a reduced D2% of all PTVs. In total, ten of the twelve mimicked plans were clinically acceptable.\nWe created a CNN model which can generate clinically acceptable plans for left-sided locally advanced breast cancer patients. This model shows great potential to speed up the treatment planning process while maintaining consistent plan quality.",

    "abstract": "In settings without access to rapid expert radiographic interpretation, artificial intelligence (AI)-based chest radiograph (CXR) analysis can triage persons presenting with possible tuberculosis (TB) symptoms, to identify those who require additional microbiological testing. However, there is limited evidence of the cost-effectiveness of this technology as a triage tool.\nA decision analysis model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of triage strategies with AI-based CXR analysis for patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary TB in Karachi, Pakistan. These strategies were compared to the current standard of care using microbiological testing with smear microscopy or GeneXpert, without prior triage. Positive triage CXRs were considered to improve referral success for microbiologic testing, from 91% to 100% for eligible persons. Software diagnostic accuracy was based on a prospective field study in Karachi. Other inputs were obtained from the Pakistan TB Program. The analysis was conducted from the healthcare provider perspective, and costs were expressed in 2020 US dollars.\nCompared to upfront smear microscopy for all persons with presumptive TB, triage strategies with AI-based CXR analysis were projected to lower costs by 19%, from $23233 per 1000 persons, and avert 3%-4% disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), from 372 DALYs. Compared to upfront GeneXpert, AI-based triage strategies lowered projected costs by 37%, from $34346 and averted 4% additional DALYs, from 369 DALYs. Reinforced follow-up for persons with positive triage CXRs but negative microbiologic tests was particularly cost-effective.\nIn lower-resource settings, the addition of AI-based CXR triage before microbiologic testing for persons with possible TB symptoms can reduce costs, avert additional DALYs, and improve TB detection.",

    "results": "Compared to upfront smear microscopy for all persons with presumptive TB, triage strategies with AI-based CXR analysis were projected to lower costs by 19%, from $23233 per 1000 persons, and avert 3%-4% disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), from 372 DALYs. Compared to upfront GeneXpert, AI-based triage strategies lowered projected costs by 37%, from $34346 and averted 4% additional DALYs, from 369 DALYs. Reinforced follow-up for persons with positive triage CXRs but negative microbiologic tests was particularly cost-effective.",

    "abstract": "Extensive sampling of neural activity during rich cognitive phenomena is critical for robust understanding of brain function. Here we present the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), in which high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging responses to tens of thousands of richly annotated natural scenes were measured while participants performed a continuous recognition task. To optimize data quality, we developed and applied novel estimation and denoising techniques. Simple visual inspections of the NSD data reveal clear representational transformations along the ventral visual pathway. Further exemplifying the inferential power of the dataset, we used NSD to build and train deep neural network models that predict brain activity more accurately than state-of-the-art models from computer vision. NSD also includes substantial resting-state and diffusion data, enabling network neuroscience perspectives to constrain and enhance models of perception and memory. Given its unprecedented scale, quality and breadth, NSD opens new avenues of inquiry in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated promise in predicting mortality; however, understanding spatial variation in risk factor contributions to mortality rate requires explainability. We applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) on a stack-ensemble machine learning model framework to explore and visualize the spatial distribution of the contributions of known risk factors to lung and bronchus cancer (LBC) mortality rates in the conterminous United States. We used five base-learners-generalized linear model (GLM), random forest (RF), Gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme Gradient boosting machine (XGBoost), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) for developing stack-ensemble models. Then we applied several model-agnostic approaches to interpret and visualize the stack ensemble model's output in global and local scales (at the county level). The stack ensemble generally performs better than all the base learners and three spatial regression models. A permutation-based feature importance technique ranked smoking prevalence as the most important predictor, followed by poverty and elevation. However, the impact of these risk factors on LBC mortality rates varies spatially. This is the first study to use ensemble machine learning with explainable algorithms to explore and visualize the spatial heterogeneity of the relationships between LBC mortality and risk factors in the contiguous USA.",

    "abstract": "To develop a comprehensive three-dimensional analyses of segmental tomography (placido and optical coherence tomography) using artificial intelligence (AI).\nPreoperative imaging data (MS-39, CSO, Italy) of refractive surgery patients with stable outcomes and diagnosed with asymmetric or bilateral keratoconus (KC) were used. The curvature, wavefront aberrations and thickness distributions were analysed with Zernike polynomials (ZP) and a random forest (RF) AI model. For training and cross-validation, there were groups of healthy (n=527), very asymmetric ectasia (VAE; n=144) and KC (n=454). The VAE eyes were the fellow eyes of KC patients but no further manual segregation of these eyes into subclinical or forme-fruste was performed.\nThe AI achieved an excellent area under the curve (0.994), accuracy (95.6%), recall (98.5%) and precision (92.7%) for the healthy eyes. For the KC eyes, the same were 0.997, 99.1%, 98.7% and 99.1%, respectively. For the VAE eyes, the same were 0.976, 95.5%, 71.5% and 91.2%, respectively. Interestingly, the AI reclassified 36 (subclinical) of the VAE eyes as healthy though these eyes were distinct from healthy eyes. Most of the remaining VAE (n=104; forme fruste) eyes retained their classification, and were distinct from both KC and healthy eyes. Further, the posterior surface features were not among the highest ranked variables by the AI model.\nA universal architecture of combining segmental tomography with ZP and AI was developed. It achieved an excellent classification of healthy and KC eyes. The AI efficiently classified the VAE eyes as 'subclinical' and 'forme-fruste'.",

    "abstract": "The risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) clinical manifestations and patient management is estimated according to risk scores accounting multifactorial risk factors, thus failing to cover the individual cardiovascular risk. Technological improvements in the field of medical imaging, in particular, in cardiac computed tomography angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance protocols, laid the development of radiogenomics. Radiogenomics aims to integrate a huge number of imaging features and molecular profiles to identify optimal radiomic/biomarker signatures. In addition, supervised and unsupervised artificial intelligence algorithms have the potential to combine different layers of data (imaging parameters and features, clinical variables and biomarkers) and elaborate complex and specific CHD risk models allowing more accurate diagnosis and reliable prognosis prediction. Literature from the past 5 years was systematically collected from PubMed and Scopus databases, and 60 studies were selected. We speculated the applicability of radiogenomics and artificial intelligence through the application of machine learning algorithms to identify CHD and characterize atherosclerotic lesions and myocardial abnormalities. Radiomic features extracted by cardiac computed tomography angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance showed good diagnostic accuracy for the identification of coronary plaques and myocardium structure; on the other hand, few studies exploited radiogenomics integration, thus suggesting further research efforts in this field. Cardiac computed tomography angiography resulted the most used noninvasive imaging modality for artificial intelligence applications. Several studies provided high performance for CHD diagnosis, classification, and prognostic assessment even though several efforts are still needed to validate and standardize algorithms for CHD patient routine according to good medical practice.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer remains a major public health challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to financial and logistical issues. WHO recommendation for cervical cancer screening in LMICs includes HPV testing as primary screening followed by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and treatment. However, VIA is a subjective procedure dependent on the healthcare provider's experience. Its accuracy can be improved by computer-aided detection techniques. Our aim is to assess the performance of a smartphone-based Automated VIA Classifier (AVC) relying on Artificial Intelligence to discriminate precancerous and cancerous lesions from normal cervical tissue.\nThe AVC study will be nested in an ongoing cervical cancer screening program called \"3T-study\" (for Test, Triage and Treat), including HPV self-sampling followed by VIA triage and treatment if needed. After application of acetic acid on the cervix, precancerous and cancerous cells whiten more rapidly than non-cancerous ones and their whiteness persists stronger overtime. The AVC relies on this key feature to determine whether the cervix is suspect for precancer or cancer. In order to train and validate the AVC, 6000 women aged 30 to 49 years meeting the inclusion criteria will be recruited on a voluntary basis, with an estimated 100 CIN2+, calculated using a confidence level of 95% and an estimated sensitivity of 90% +/-7% precision on either side. Diagnostic test performance of AVC test and two current standard tests (VIA and cytology) used routinely for triage will be evaluated and compared. Histopathological examination will serve as reference standard. Participants' and providers' acceptability of the technology will also be assessed. The study protocol was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT04859530).\nThe study will determine whether AVC test can be an effective method for cervical cancer screening in LMICs.",

    "abstract": "This paper combines echocardiographic signal processing and artificial intelligence technology to propose a deep neural network model adapted to echocardiographic signals to achieve left atrial volume measurement and automatic assessment of pulmonary veins efficiently and quickly. Based on the echocardiographic signal generation mechanism and detection method, an experimental scheme for the echocardiographic signal acquisition was designed. The echocardiographic signal data of healthy subjects were measured in four different experimental states, and a database of left atrial volume measurements and pulmonary veins was constructed. Combining the correspondence between ECG signals and echocardiographic signals in the time domain, a series of preprocessing such as denoising, feature point localization, and segmentation of the cardiac cycle was realized by wavelet transform and threshold method to complete the data collection. This paper proposes a comparative model based on artificial intelligence, adapts to the characteristics of one-dimensional time-series echocardiographic signals, automatically extracts the deep features of echocardiographic signals, effectively reduces the subjective influence of manual feature selection, and realizes the automatic classification and evaluation of human left atrial volume measurement and pulmonary veins under different states. The experimental results show that the proposed BP neural network model has good adaptability and classification performance in the tasks of LV volume measurement and pulmonary vein automatic classification evaluation and achieves an average test accuracy of over 96.58%. The average root-mean-square error percentage of signal compression is only 0.65% by extracting the coding features of the original echocardiographic signal through the convolutional autoencoder, which completes the signal compression with low loss. Comparing the training time and classification accuracy of the LSTM network with the original signal and encoded features, the experimental results show that the AI model can greatly reduce the model training time cost and achieve an average accuracy of 97.97% in the test set and increase the real-time performance of the left atrial volume measurement and pulmonary vein evaluation as well as the security of the data transmission process, which is very important for the comparison of left atrial volume measurement and pulmonary vein. It is of great practical importance to compare left atrial volume measurements with pulmonary veins.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been applied in various medical domains to predict patient outcomes with high accuracy. As AI becomes more widely adopted, the problem of model bias is increasingly apparent. In this study, we investigate the model bias that can occur when training a model using datasets for only one particular gender and aim to present new insights into the bias issue. For the investigation, we considered an AI model that predicts severity at an early stage based on the medical records of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. For 5,601 confirmed COVID-19 patients, we used 37 medical records, namely, basic patient information, physical index, initial examination findings, clinical findings, comorbidity diseases, and general blood test results at an early stage. To investigate the gender-based AI model bias, we trained and evaluated two separate models-one that was trained using only the male group, and the other using only the female group. When the model trained by the male-group data was applied to the female testing data, the overall accuracy decreased-sensitivity from 0.93 to 0.86, specificity from 0.92 to 0.86, accuracy from 0.92 to 0.86, balanced accuracy from 0.93 to 0.86, and area under the curve (AUC) from 0.97 to 0.94. Similarly, when the model trained by the female-group data was applied to the male testing data, once again, the overall accuracy decreased-sensitivity from 0.97 to 0.90, specificity from 0.96 to 0.91, accuracy from 0.96 to 0.91, balanced accuracy from 0.96 to 0.90, and AUC from 0.97 to 0.95. Furthermore, when we evaluated each gender-dependent model with the test data from the same gender used for training, the resultant accuracy was also lower than that from the unbiased model.",

    "abstract": "To accelerate cancer research that correlates biomarkers with clinical endpoints, methods are needed to ascertain outcomes from electronic health records at scale. Here, we train deep natural language processing (NLP) models to extract outcomes for participants with any of 7 solid tumors in a precision oncology study. Outcomes are extracted from 305,151 imaging reports for 13,130 patients and 233,517 oncologist notes for 13,511 patients, including patients with 6 additional cancer types. NLP models recapitulate outcome annotation from these documents, including the presence of cancer, progression/worsening, response/improvement, and metastases, with excellent discrimination (AUROC\u2009>\u20090.90). Models generalize to cancers excluded from training and yield outcomes correlated with survival. Among patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors, we confirm that high tumor mutation burden is associated with superior progression-free survival ascertained using NLP. Here, we show that deep NLP can accelerate annotation of molecular cancer datasets with clinically meaningful endpoints to facilitate discovery.",

    "abstract": "Basic foundations of artificial intelligence (AI) include analyzing large amounts of data, recognizing patterns, and predicting outcomes. At the core of AI are well-defined areas, such as machine learning, natural language processing, artificial neural networks, and computer vision. Although research and development of AI in health care is being conducted in many medical subspecialties, only a few applications have been implemented in clinical practice. This is true in vascular surgery, where applications are mostly in the translational research stage. These AI applications are being evaluated in the realms of vascular diagnostics, perioperative medicine, risk stratification, and outcome prediction, among others. Apart from the technical challenges of AI and research outcomes on safe and beneficial use in patient care, ethical issues and policy surrounding AI will present future challenges for its successful implementation. This review will give a brief overview and a basic understanding of AI and summarize the currently available and used clinical AI applications in vascular surgery.",

We investigated whether the likelihood of LA remodeling, LA dysfunction, altered hemodynamics, and risk for incident AF could be identified from a single 12-lead ECG using a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled ECG analysis.\nPatients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (n=613) underwent AI-enabled ECG analysis, echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization. Individuals were grouped by AI-enabled ECG probability of contemporaneous AF, taken as an indicator of underlying LA myopathy.\nStructural heart disease was more severe in patients with higher AI-probability of AF, with more left ventricular hypertrophy, larger LA volumes, and lower LA reservoir and booster strain. Cardiac filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressures were higher in patients with higher AI-probability, while cardiac output reserve was more impaired during exercise. Among patients with sinus rhythm and no prior AF, each 10% increase in AI-probability was associated with a 31% greater risk of developing new-onset AF (hazard ratio, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.20-1.42]; \nA novel AI-enabled score derived from a single 12-lead ECG identifies the presence of underlying LA myopathy in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction as evidenced by structural, functional, and hemodynamic abnormalities, as well as long-term risk for incident AF.

Cardiac filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressures were higher in patients with higher AI-probability, while cardiac output reserve was more impaired during exercise. Among patients with sinus rhythm and no prior AF, each 10% increase in AI-probability was associated with a 31% greater risk of developing new-onset AF (hazard ratio, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.20-1.42]; ",

    "abstract": "There is a need for an improved understanding of clinical and biologic risk factors in pediatric cancer to improve patient outcomes. Machine learning (ML) represents the application of computational inference from advanced statistical methods that can be applied to increasing amount of data available for study in pediatric oncology. The goal of this systematic review was to systematically characterize the state of ML in pediatric oncology and highlight advances and opportunities in the field.\nWe conducted a systematic review of the Embase, Scopus, and MEDLINE databases for applications of ML in pediatric oncology. Query results from all three databases were aggregated and duplicate studies were removed.\nA total of 42 unique articles that examined the applications of ML in pediatric oncology met inclusion criteria for review. We identified 20 studies of CNS tumors, 13 of solid tumors, and nine of leukemia. ML tasks included classification, prediction of treatment response, and dose optimization with a variety of methods being used including neural network, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, naive Bayes, and support vector machines. Strengths of the identified studies included matching or outperforming physician comparators via automated analysis and predicting therapeutic response. Common limitations included significant heterogeneity in reporting standards, clinical applicability, small sample sizes, and missing external validation cohorts.\nWe identified areas where ML can enhance clinical care in ways that may not otherwise be achievable. Although ML promises enormous potential in improving diagnostics, decision making, and monitoring for children with cancer, the field remains in early stages and future work will be aided by standards and guidelines to ensure rigorous methodologic design and maximizing clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "Computational approaches have been used at different stages of drug development with the purpose of decreasing the time and cost of conventional experimental procedures. Lately, techniques mainly developed and applied in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), have been transferred to different application domains such as biomedicine.\nIn this study, we conducted an investigative analysis via data-driven evaluation of potential hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapeutics in the context of AI-assisted drug discovery/repurposing. First, we discussed basic concepts, computational approaches, databases, modeling approaches, and featurization techniques in drug discovery/repurposing. In the analysis part, we automatically integrated HCC-related biological entities such as genes/proteins, pathways, phenotypes, drugs/compounds, and other diseases with similar implications, and represented these heterogeneous relationships via a knowledge graph using the CROssBAR system.\nFollowing the system-level evaluation and selection of critical genes/proteins and pathways to target, our deep learning-based drug/compound-target protein interaction predictors DEEPScreen and MDeePred have been employed for predicting new bioactive drugs and compounds for these critical targets. Finally, we embedded ligands of selected HCC-associated proteins which had a significant enrichment with the CROssBAR system into a 2-D space to identify and repurpose small molecule inhibitors as potential drug candidates based on their molecular similarities to known HCC drugs.\nWe expect that these series of data-driven analyses can be used as a roadmap to propose early-stage potential inhibitors (from database-scale sets of compounds) to both HCC and other complex diseases, which may subsequently be analyzed with more targeted in silico and experimental approaches.",

    "abstract": "The research achievements of artificial intelligence technology in the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were explored, and the advantages and problems encountered in the development of intelligent nursing were analyzed. This paper presents the application of artificial intelligence in the emergency care of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The method included 447 COPD patients in a randomized controlled trial to observe the improvement of quality of life at 4 and 12 months after artificial intelligence medical intervention. A prospective randomized controlled trial included 101 patients with COPD who underwent a 9-month web-based knowledge exercise on the prevention of acute exacerbation of COPD through artificial intelligence medicine and were randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group and the control group. The results show that, in the experimental group and the control group, after 4 months, the quality of life does not change; after 12 months, compared with controls, the quality of life and emotional and psychological conditions have improved obviously. 29 patients who participated in the experiment and were randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group showed satisfactory results. COPD hospitalized rate and length of hospital stay were decreased in the experimental group than in the control group. For single-factor analysis, artificial intelligence medical intervention has not achieved significant significance, and the experimental results have preliminarily confirmed the effectiveness of artificial intelligence medical treatment.",

    "abstract": "In many reviews, it is found that parental responsiveness, parental emotion-related coaching, and parental positive demandingness are related to children's higher emotional intelligence (EI), while parental negative demandingness is related to children's lower EI. There is a lack of Indian work in this area.\nTo study the role of EI and parenting style in predicting psychological well-being among adolescents in an Indian scenario.\nThis cross-sectional, analytical study was carried out on 75 boys and 75 girls in the age range of 15-18 years and attending school. They were assessed with the sociodemographic data sheet, trait EI questionnaire, psychological well-being inventory, and parental authority questionnaire. After the administration on different scales, the scoring was done and data were analyzed with SPSS.\nThere were no gender differences in the scores of EI, psychological well-being, and self-reported parenting style scores. There was a significant positive co-relation between well being and authoritative, authoritarian and autonomy, positive relationship. and self acceptance. Authoritarian parenting style is highly correlated with EI in comparison to authoritative and permissive parenting styles.\nAuthoritarian parenting style is most suitable for the development of EI and on the other hand, permissive parenting style has the least role in the development of EI. EI and parenting style are found to predict the psychological well-being in adolescents.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and variant prioritization tools for genomic variant analysis are being rapidly developed for use in clinical diagnostic testing. However, their clinical utility and reliability are currently limited. Therefore, we performed a validation of a commercial AI tool (Moon) and a comprehensive reanalysis of previously collected clinical exome sequencing cases using an open-source variant prioritization tool (Exomiser) and the now-validated AI tool to test their feasibility in clinical diagnostics.\nA validation study of Moon was performed with 29 positive cases determined by previous manual analysis. After validation, reanalysis was performed on 80 previously manually analyzed nondiagnostic exome cases using Moon. Finally, a comparison between Moon and Exomiser was completed regarding their ability to identify previously completed positive cases and to identify new positive cases.\nMoon correctly selected the causal variant(s) in 97% of manually analyzed positive cases and identified 7 new positive cases. Exomiser correctly identified the causal gene in 85% of positive cases and agreed with Moon by ranking the new gene in its top 10 list 43% of the time.\nThe use of AI in diagnostic laboratories greatly enhances exome sequencing analysis by reducing analysis time and increasing the diagnostic rate.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence in healthcare refers to the use of complex algorithms designed to conduct certain tasks in an automated manner. Artificial intelligence has a transformative power in radiation oncology to improve the quality and efficiency of patient care, given the increase in volume and complexity of digital data, as well as the multi-faceted and highly technical nature of this field of medicine. However, artificial intelligence alone will not be able to fix healthcare's problem, because new technologies bring unexpected and potentially underappreciated obstacles. The inclusion of multicentre datasets, the incorporation of time-varying data, the assessment of missing data as well as informative censoring and the addition of clinical utility could significantly improve artificial intelligence models. Standardisation plays a crucial, supportive and leading role in artificial intelligence. Clinical trials are the most reliable method of demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a treatment or clinical approach, as well as providing high-level evidence to justify artificial intelligence. The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the Gynecologic Oncology Group collaborated to form NRG Oncology (acronym NRG derived from the names of the parental groups). NRG Oncology is one of the adult cancer clinical trial groups containing radiotherapy specialty of the National Cancer Institute's Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). Standardisation from NRG/NCTN has the potential to reduce variation in clinical treatment and patient outcome by eliminating potential errors, enabling broader application of artificial intelligence tools. NCTN, NRG and Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core are in a unique position to help with standards development, advocacy and enforcement, all of which can benefit from artificial intelligence, as artificial intelligence has the ability to improve trial success rates by transforming crucial phases in clinical trial design, from study planning through to execution. Here we will examine: (i) how to conduct technical and clinical evaluations before adopting artificial intelligence technologies, (ii) how to obtain high-quality data for artificial intelligence, (iii) the NCTN infrastructure and standards, (iv) radiotherapy standardisation for clinical trials and (v) artificial intelligence applications in standardisation.",

    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common medical problem in hospitalised patients worldwide that may result in negative physiological, social and economic consequences. Amongst patients admitted to ICU with AKI, over 40% have had either elective or emergency surgery prior to admission. Predicting outcomes after AKI is difficult and the decision on whom to initiate RRT with a goal of renal recovery or predict a long-term survival benefit still poses a challenge for acute care physicians. With the increasing use of electronic healthcare records, artificial intelligence may allow postoperative AKI prognostication and aid clinical management. Patients will benefit if the data can be readily\u00a0accessed andregulatory, ethical and human factors challenges can be overcome.",

    "abstract": "The electronic vaccine intelligence network (eVIN) was introduced by India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 12 states and was implemented by the United Nations Development Programme through the Gavi health system strengthening support during 2014-17 to replace the traditional paper-based cold-chain management system with an electronic vaccine logistics management system. An economic assessment was conducted as part of the overall assessment of eVIN. The objective of the economic assessment was to conduct a return on investment analysis of eVIN implementation. Return on investment was defined as the ratio of total benefits (savings) from eVIN to total investment in eVIN. All costs were calculated in 2020 prices and reported in Indian rupees (1 US dollar\u00a0=\u00a0INR 74.132). A one-rupee investment in eVIN led to a return of INR 0.52 for traditional vaccines. The highest cost savings from eVIN was from better vaccine stock management. When same percentage of savings from the new vaccines were incorporated into the analysis, one-rupee investment in eVIN led to a return of INR 1.41. In the future, when only recurrent costs will exist, the return from eVIN will be even higher: a one-rupee investment in eVIN will yield a return of INR 2.93. The assessment of eVIN showed promising results in streamlining the vaccine flow network and ensuring equity in vaccine stock management along with good return on investment; hence, there was a rapid expansion of eVIN in all 731 districts across 36 states and union territories in the country.",

    "abstract": "In large-scale events such as concerts and sports competitions, participants often leave the venue at the same time to return to their respective destinations. Improper traffic planning and traffic light operation usually lead to traffic congestion and road chaos near the sites. Rapid evacuation of participants has become an important issue.\nIn this work, a one-way road orientation planning problem with multiple venues is studied in which all roads near the venues are to be scheduled into a one-way orientation with strong connectivity to increase the evacuation efficiency of participants.\nIn accordance with Robbins' theorem and a random sequence of integers, an encoding scheme based on module operator is presented to construct a strongly connected graph and plan a one-way orientation for all roads. The proposed encoding scheme is further embedded into four artificial intelligence approaches, namely, grey wolf optimization, immune algorithm, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization, to solve the one-way road orientation planning problem such that the total distance of all vehicles from venues to their destinations is minimized.\nNumerical results of test problems with multiple venues in Taiwan are provided and analyzed. As shown, all four algorithms can obtain the best solution for the test problems.\nThe new presented encoding scheme with four algorithms can be used to effectively solve the one-way road orientation planning problem for the evacuation of participants. Moreover, grey wolf optimization is superior to the other three algorithms and particle swarm optimization is faster than the other three algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Background Use of artificial intelligence (AI) as a stand-alone reader for digital mammography (DM) or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) breast screening could ease radiologists' workload while maintaining quality. Purpose To retrospectively evaluate the stand-alone performance of an AI system as an independent reader of DM and DBT screening examinations. Materials and Methods Consecutive screening-paired and independently read DM and DBT images acquired between January 2015 and December 2016 were retrospectively collected from the Tomosynthesis Cordoba Screening Trial. An AI system computed a cancer risk score (range, 1-100) for DM and DBT examinations independently. AI stand-alone performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity and recall rate at different operating points selected to have noninferior sensitivity compared with the human readings (noninferiority margin, 5%). The recall rate of AI and the human readings were compared using a McNemar test. Results A total of 15\u2009999 DM and DBT examinations (113 breast cancers, including 98 screen-detected and 15 interval cancers) from 15\u2009998 women (mean age, 58 years \u00b1 6 [standard deviation]) were evaluated. AI achieved an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.96) for DM and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.97) for DBT. For DM, AI achieved noninferior sensitivity as a single (58.4%; 66 of 113; 95% CI: 49.2, 67.1) or double (67.3%; 76 of 113; 95% CI: 58.2, 75.2) reader, with a reduction in recall rate (",

    "abstract": "There have been few independent evaluations of computer-aided detection (CAD) software for tuberculosis (TB) screening, despite the rapidly expanding array of available CAD solutions. We developed a test library of chest X-ray (CXR) images which was blindly re-read by two TB clinicians with different levels of experience and then processed by 12 CAD software solutions. Using Xpert MTB/RIF results as the reference standard, we compared the performance characteristics of each CAD software against both an Expert and Intermediate Reader, using cut-off thresholds which were selected to match the sensitivity of each human reader. Six CAD systems performed on par with the Expert Reader (Qure.ai, DeepTek, Delft Imaging, JF Healthcare, OXIPIT, and Lunit) and one additional software (Infervision) performed on par with the Intermediate Reader only. Qure.ai, Delft Imaging and Lunit were the only software to perform significantly better than the Intermediate Reader. The majority of these CAD software showed significantly lower performance among participants with a past history of TB. The radiography equipment used to capture the CXR image was also shown to affect performance for some CAD software. TB program implementers now have a wide selection of quality CAD software solutions to utilize in their CXR screening initiatives.",

    "abstract": "To develop a fully automatic model capable of reliably quantifying epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volumes and attenuation in large scale population studies to investigate their relation to markers of cardiometabolic risk. Non-contrast cardiac CT images from the SCAPIS study were used to train and test a convolutional neural network based model to quantify EAT by: segmenting the pericardium, suppressing noise-induced artifacts in the heart chambers, and, if image sets were incomplete, imputing missing EAT volumes. The model achieved a mean Dice coefficient of 0.90 when tested against expert manual segmentations on 25 image sets. Tested on 1400 image sets, the model successfully segmented 99.4% of the cases. Automatic imputation of missing EAT volumes had an error of less than 3.1% with up to 20% of the slices in image sets missing. The most important predictors of EAT volumes were weight and waist, while EAT attenuation was predicted mainly by EAT volume. A model with excellent performance, capable of fully automatic handling of the most common challenges in large scale EAT quantification has been developed. In studies of the importance of EAT in disease development, the strong co-variation with anthropometric measures needs to be carefully considered.",

    "abstract": "For the association between time-lapse technology (TLT) and embryo ploidy status, there has not yet been fully understood. TLT has the characteristics of large amount of data and non-invasiveness. If we want to accurately predict embryo ploidy status from TLT, artificial intelligence (AI) technology is a good choice. However, the current work of AI in this field needs to be strengthened.\nA total of 469 preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) cycles and 1803 blastocysts from April 2018 to November 2019 were included in the study. All embryo images are captured during 5 or 6 days after fertilization before biopsy by time-lapse microscope system. All euploid embryos or aneuploid embryos are used as data sets. The data set is divided into training set, validation set and test set. The training set is mainly used for model training, the validation set is mainly used to adjust the hyperparameters of the model and the preliminary evaluation of the model, and the test set is used to evaluate the generalization ability of the model. For better verification, we used data other than the training data for external verification. A total of 155 PGT cycles from December 2019 to December 2020 and 523 blastocysts were included in the verification process.\nThe euploid prediction algorithm (EPA) was able to predict euploid on the testing dataset with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.80.\nThe TLT incubator has gradually become the choice of reproductive centers. Our AI model named EPA that can predict embryo ploidy well based on TLT data. We hope that this system can serve all in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) patients in the future, allowing embryologists to have more non-invasive aids when selecting the best embryo to transfer.",

    "abstract": "Upper gastrointestinal (GI) neoplasia account for 35% of GI cancers and 1.5 million cancer-related deaths every year. Despite its efficacy in preventing cancer mortality, diagnostic upper GI endoscopy is affected by a substantial miss rate of neoplastic lesions due to failure to recognize a visible lesion or imperfect navigation. This may be offset by the real-time application of artificial intelligence (AI) for detection (computer-aided detection [CADe]) and characterization (computer-aided diagnosis [CADx]) of upper GI neoplasia. Stand-alone performance of CADe for esophageal squamous cell neoplasia, Barrett's esophagus-related neoplasia, and gastric cancer showed promising accuracy, sensitivity ranging between 83% and 93%. However, incorporation of CADe/CADx in clinical practice depends on several factors, such as possible bias in the training or validation phases of these algorithms, its interaction with human endoscopists, and clinical implications of false-positive results. The aim of this review is to guide the clinician across the multiple steps of AI development in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "With gun crime on the rise, efforts to curb this form of violence have captured the attention of government agencies and police departments alike. One form of such efforts is the proliferation of Crime Gun Intelligence Centers (CGICs) in police departments across the country. However, with only three non-peer-reviewed evaluations of these CGICs to date, our understanding of their effectiveness is limited. The present study aims to fill this gap by examining the impact of the Phoenix Police Department's (PPD) CGIC on clearance rates and prosecutorial outcomes for gun crimes. The data for this study come from PPD's Records Management System (RMS), computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system, impounded evidence, National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN) lead data, and arrest data. Prosecutorial data were supplied by the Maricopa County Attorney's Office (MCAO). This study examined pretest and posttest differences that occurred over the study period. Difference-in-difference (DID) models were calculated to assess the impact of the CGIC on the outcome measures of interest. We found that from the year prior to the CGIC to 2\u00a0years post-CGIC, NIBIN inputs increased by 115%, NIBIN leads increased by 163%, timeliness of entry (of ballistics evidence) improved with 32% of processed items entered within 24-48\u00a0h in the second year of the CGIC compared with only 3% the year preceding the CGIC, and clearance rates for arrests increased significantly. These findings have implications for the continued adoption of CGIC, as well as the utility of NIBIN.",

The mainstream technologies of the AI boom in 2021 are machine learning (ML) and deep learning, which have made significant progress due to the increase in computational resources accompanied by the dramatic improvement in computer performance. In this review, we introduce AI/ML-based medical devices and prediction models regarding diabetes.\nIn the field of diabetes, several AI-/ML-based medical devices and regarding automatic retinal screening, clinical diagnosis support, and patient self-management tool have already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. As for new-onset diabetes prediction using ML methods, its performance is not superior to conventional risk stratification models that use statistical approaches so far. Despite the current situation, it is expected that the predictive performance of AI will soon be maximized by a large amount of organized data and abundant computational resources, which will contribute to a dramatic improvement in the accuracy of disease prediction models for diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a general term that refers to the use of a machine to imitate intelligent behavior for performing complex tasks with minimal human intervention, such as machine learning; this technology is revolutionizing and reshaping medicine. AI has considerable potential to perfect health-care systems in areas such as diagnostics, risk analysis, health information administration, lifestyle supervision, and virtual health assistance. In terms of immunotherapy, AI has been applied to the prediction of immunotherapy responses based on immune signatures, medical imaging and histological analysis. These features could also be highly useful in the management of cancer immunotherapy given their ever-increasing performance in improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing treatment planning, predicting outcomes of care and reducing human resource costs. In this review, we present the details of AI and the current progression and state of the art in employing AI for cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges, opportunities and corresponding strategies in applying the technology for widespread clinical deployment. Finally, we summarize the impact of AI on cancer immunotherapy and provide our perspectives about underlying applications of AI in the future.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the second most dangerous gynecologic cancer with a high mortality rate. The classification of gene expression data from high-dimensional and small-sample gene expression data is a challenging task. The discovery of miRNAs, a small non-coding RNA with 18-25 nucleotides in length that regulates gene expression, has revealed the existence of a new array for regulation of genes and has been reported as playing a serious role in cancer. By using LASSO and Elastic Net as embedded algorithms of feature selection techniques, the present study identified 10 miRNAs that were regulated in ovarian serum cancer samples compared to non-cancer samples in public available dataset GSE106817: hsa-miR-5100, hsa-miR-6800-5p, hsa-miR-1233-5p, hsa-miR-4532, hsa-miR-4783-3p, hsa-miR-4787-3p, hsa-miR-1228-5p, hsa-miR-1290, hsa-miR-3184-5p, and hsa-miR-320b. Further, we implemented state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers, such as logistic regression, random forest, artificial neural network, XGBoost, and decision trees to build clinical prediction models. Next, the diagnostic performance of these models with identified miRNAs was evaluated in the internal (GSE106817) and external validation dataset (GSE113486) by ROC analysis. The results showed that first four prediction models consistently yielded an AUC of 100%. Our findings provide significant evidence that the serum miRNA profile represents a promising diagnostic biomarker for ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a technology that uses electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to control external devices, such as Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). Visual BCI paradigms based on P300 and Steady State Visually Evoked potentials (SSVEP) have shown high potential for clinical purposes. Numerous studies have been published on P300- and SSVEP-based non-invasive BCIs, but many of them present two shortcomings: (1) they are not aimed for motor rehabilitation applications, and (2) they do not report in detail the artificial intelligence (AI) methods used for classification, or their performance metrics. To address this gap, in this paper the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology was applied to prepare a systematic literature review (SLR). Papers older than 10 years, repeated or not related to a motor rehabilitation application, were excluded. Of all the studies, 51.02% referred to theoretical analysis of classification algorithms. Of the remaining, 28.48% were for spelling, 12.73% for diverse applications (control of wheelchair or home appliances), and only 7.77% were focused on motor rehabilitation. After the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and quality screening was performed, 34 articles were selected. Of them, 26.47% used the P300 and 55.8% the SSVEP signal. Five applications categories were established: Rehabilitation Systems (17.64%), Virtual Reality environments (23.52%), FES (17.64%), Orthosis (29.41%), and Prosthesis (11.76%). Of all the works, only four performed tests with patients. The most reported machine learning (ML) algorithms used for classification were linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (48.64%) and support vector machine (16.21%), while only one study used a deep learning algorithm: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The reported accuracy ranged from 38.02 to 100%, and the Information Transfer Rate from 1.55 to 49.25 bits per minute. While LDA is still the most used AI algorithm, CNN has shown promising results, but due to their high technical implementation requirements, many researchers do not justify its implementation as worthwile. To achieve quick and accurate online BCIs for motor rehabilitation applications, future works on SSVEP-, P300-based and hybrid BCIs should focus on optimizing the visual stimulation module and the training stage of ML and DL algorithms.",

However, because of a lack of AI literacy, most HCPs are not adequately prepared for this revolution. This is a significant barrier to adopting and implementing AI that will affect patients. In addition, the limited existing AI education programs face barriers to development and implementation at various levels of medical education.\nWith a view to informing future AI education programs for HCPs, this scoping review aims to provide an overview of the types of current or past AI education programs that pertains to the programs' curricular content, modes of delivery, critical implementation factors for education delivery, and outcomes used to assess the programs' effectiveness.\nAfter the creation of a search strategy and keyword searches, a 2-stage screening process was conducted by 2 independent reviewers to determine study eligibility. When consensus was not reached, the conflict was resolved by consulting a third reviewer. This process consisted of a title and abstract scan and a full-text review. The articles were included if they discussed an actual training program or educational intervention, or a potential training program or educational intervention and the desired content to be covered, focused on AI, and were designed or intended for HCPs (at any stage of their career).\nOf the 10,094 unique citations scanned, 41 (0.41%) studies relevant to our eligibility criteria were identified. Among the 41 included studies, 10 (24%) described 13 unique programs and 31 (76%) discussed recommended curricular content. The curricular content of the unique programs ranged from AI use, AI interpretation, and cultivating skills to explain results derived from AI algorithms. The curricular topics were categorized into three main domains: cognitive, psychomotor, and affective.\nThis review provides an overview of the current landscape of AI in medical education and highlights the skills and competencies required by HCPs to effectively use AI in enhancing the quality of care and optimizing patient outcomes. Future education efforts should focus on the development of regulatory strategies, a multidisciplinary approach to curriculum redesign, a competency-based curriculum, and patient-clinician interaction.",

    "abstract": "Certain types of artificial intelligence (AI), that is, deep learning models, can outperform health care professionals in particular domains. Such models hold considerable promise for improved diagnostics, treatment, and prevention, as well as more cost-efficient health care. They are, however, opaque in the sense that their exact reasoning cannot be fully explicated. Different stakeholders have emphasized the importance of the transparency/explainability of AI decision making. Transparency/explainability may come at the cost of performance. There is need for a public policy regulating the use of AI in health care that balances the societal interests in high performance as well as in transparency/explainability. A public policy should consider the wider public's interests in such features of AI.\nThis study elicited the public's preferences for the performance and explainability of AI decision making in health care and determined whether these preferences depend on respondent characteristics, including trust in health and technology and fears and hopes regarding AI.\nWe conducted a choice-based conjoint survey of public preferences for attributes of AI decision making in health care in a representative sample of the adult Danish population. Initial focus group interviews yielded 6 attributes playing a role in the respondents' views on the use of AI decision support in health care: (1) type of AI decision, (2) level of explanation, (3) performance/accuracy, (4) responsibility for the final decision, (5) possibility of discrimination, and (6) severity of the disease to which the AI is applied. In total, 100 unique choice sets were developed using fractional factorial design. In a 12-task survey, respondents were asked about their preference for AI system use in hospitals in relation to 3 different scenarios.\nOf the 1678 potential respondents, 1027 (61.2%) participated. The respondents consider the physician having the final responsibility for treatment decisions the most important attribute, with 46.8% of the total weight of attributes, followed by explainability of the decision (27.3%) and whether the system has been tested for discrimination (14.8%). Other factors, such as gender, age, level of education, whether respondents live rurally or in towns, respondents' trust in health and technology, and respondents' fears and hopes regarding AI, do not play a significant role in the majority of cases.\nThe 3 factors that are most important to the public are, in descending order of importance, (1) that physicians are ultimately responsible for diagnostics and treatment planning, (2) that the AI decision support is explainable, and (3) that the AI system has been tested for discrimination. Public policy on AI system use in health care should give priority to such AI system use and ensure that patients are provided with information.",

Recently, efforts have been made to engage community hospital ICUs in research albeit with barriers. Automation or artificial intelligence (AI) could aid the performance of routine research tasks. It is unclear which research study processes might be improved through AI automation.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional survey of Canadian ICU research personnel. The survey contained items characterizing opinions regarding research processes that may be amenable to AI automation. We distributed the questionnaire via email distribution lists of 3 Canadian research societies. Open-ended questions were analyzed using a thematic content analysis approach.\nA total of 49 survey responses were received (response rate: 8%). Tasks that respondents felt were time-consuming/tedious/tiresome included: screening for potentially eligible patients (74%), inputting data into case report forms (65%), and preparing internal tracking logs (53%). Tasks that respondents felt could be performed by AI automation included: screening for eligible patients (59%), inputting data into case report forms (55%), preparing internal tracking logs (51%), and randomizing patients into studies (45%). Open-ended questions identified enthusiasm for AI automation to improve information accuracy and efficiency while freeing up RCs to perform tasks that require human interaction. This enthusiasm was tempered by the need for proper AI education and oversight.\nThere were balanced supportive (increased efficiency and re-allocation of tasks) and challenges (informational accuracy and oversight) with regards to AI automation in ICU research.",

    "abstract": "As a result of the decrease in socialization levels in computer-supported collaborative learning settings and/or interactions in social environments during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the adverse influence on the social intelligence development of nursing students could trigger loneliness.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the association of perceived sociability and social intelligence on loneliness in online learning among nursing students in Turkey.\nDescriptive, correlational and predictive study.\nA total of 246 nursing students in the Nursing Department of a state university in the Istanbul province of Turkey were included.\nData were collected using the Participant Information Form, Sociability Scale, UCLA Loneliness Scale-8 (ULS-8) for the Adolescents, and Tromso Social Intelligence Scale (TSIS) between November 2020 and December 2020. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of loneliness. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThe total mean Sociability Scale score was 23.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.51 (range: 10-46). The total mean TSIS score was 74.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.98 (range: 46-105) and the total mean ULS-8 was 13.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.98 (range: 7-27). Perceived sociability in online learning (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.321, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), and social intelligence (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.347, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) were significant negative predictors (R\nPerceived sociability in online learning and social intelligence was associated with the level of loneliness of this population during online learning.",

    "abstract": "Optimal outcomes after large-vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke are highly dependent on prompt diagnosis, effective communication, and treatment, making LVO an attractive avenue for the application of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning (ML). Our objective is to conduct a systematic review to describe existing AI applications for LVO strokes, delineate its effectiveness, and identify areas for future AI applications in stroke treatment and prognostication.\nA systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. After deduplication, studies were screened by title and abstract. Full-text studies were screened for final inclusion based on prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Relevant data were extracted from each study.\nOf 11,512 resultant articles, 40 were included. Of 30 studies with reported ML algorithms, the most commonly used ML algorithms were convolutional neural networks in 10 (33.3%), support vector machines in 10 (33.0%), and random forests in 9 (30.0%). Studies examining triage favored direct transport to a stroke center and predicted improved outcomes. ML techniques proved vastly accurate in identifying LVO on computed tomography. Applications of AI to patient selection for thrombectomy are lacking, although some studies determine individual patient eligibility for endovascular treatment with high accuracy. ML algorithms have reasonable accuracy in predicting clinical and angiographic outcomes and associated factors.\nAI has shown promise in the diagnosis and triage of patients with acute stroke. However, the role of AI in the management and prognostication remains limited and warrants further research to help in decision support.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the change patterns in corneal sub-basal nerve morphology and corneal intrinsic aberrations in dry eye disease (DED). Our study included 229 eyes of 155 patients with DED and 40 eyes of 20 healthy control. We used the Oculus keratograph and the ocular surface disease index questionnaire to assess their signs and symptoms. In vivo confocal microscopy was used to observe the corneal sub-basal nerves, corneal endothelial cells, and Langerhans cells (LCs). An artificial intelligence (AI) technique run by the deep learning model generated the sub-basal nerve fibre parameters. Furthermore, we used the Pentacam HR system to measure the corneal intrinsic aberrations and corneal surface regularity indices. DED patients more frequently had increased anterior and total corneal aberrations than controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, DED had decreased average density and maximum length of corneal nerve. (Both P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) The LC number was significantly correlated with maximum length (CC\u00a0=\u00a0-0.19, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) of the sub-basal nerve fibre. Furthermore, the corneal nerve average density was negatively correlated with IHD, and anterior, posterior, and total corneal aberrations (All P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) especially the higher-order aberrations. Significant correlations were seen between corneal nerve morphology changes, analysed by AI and corneal intrinsic aberrations, particularly higher-order aberrations.",

    "abstract": "Endoscopy is a pivotal method for detecting early gastric cancer (EGC). However, skill among endoscopists varies greatly. Here, we proposed a deep learning-based system named ENDOANGEL-ME to diagnose EGC in magnifying image-enhanced endoscopy (M-IEE).\nM-IEE images were retrospectively obtained from 6 hospitals in China, including 4667 images for training and validation, 1324 images for internal tests, and 4702 images for external tests. One hundred eighty-seven stored videos from 2 hospitals were used to evaluate the performance of ENDOANGEL-ME and endoscopists and to assess the effect of ENDOANGEL-ME on improving the performance of endoscopists. Prospective consecutive patients undergoing M-IEE were enrolled from August 17, 2020 to August 2, 2021 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University to assess the applicability of ENDOANGEL-ME in clinical practice.\nA total of 3099 patients undergoing M-IEE were enrolled in this study. The diagnostic accuracy of ENDOANGEL-ME for diagnosing EGC was 88.44% and 90.49% in internal and external images, respectively. In 93 internal videos, ENDOANGEL-ME achieved an accuracy of 90.32% for diagnosing EGC, significantly superior to that of senior endoscopists (70.16% \u00b1 8.78%). In 94 external videos, with the assistance of ENDOANGEL-ME, endoscopists showed improved accuracy and sensitivity (85.64% vs 80.32% and 82.03% vs 67.19%, respectively). In 194 prospective consecutive patients with 251 lesions, ENDOANGEL-ME achieved a sensitivity of 92.59% (25/27) and an accuracy of 83.67% (210/251) in real clinical practice.\nThis multicenter diagnostic study showed that ENDOANGEL-ME can be well applied in the clinical setting.

    "abstract": "A reliable assessment of bowel preparation is important to ensure high-quality colonoscopy. Current bowel preparation scoring systems are limited by interobserver variability. This study aimed to demonstrate objective assessment of bowel preparation adequacy using an artificial intelligence (AI)/convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm developed from colonoscopy videos.\nTwo CNNs were developed using a training set of 73,304 images from 200 colonoscopies. First, a binary CNN was developed and trained to distinguish video frames that were appropriate versus inappropriate for scoring with the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). A second multiclass CNN was developed and trained on 26,950 appropriate frames that were expertly annotated with BBPS segment scores (0-3). We validated the algorithm using 252 10-second video clips that were assigned BBPS segment scores by 2 experts. The algorithm provided mean BBPS scores based on the algorithm (AI-BBPS) by calculating mean BBPS based on each frame's scoring. We maximized the algorithm's performance by choosing a dichotomized AI-BBPS score that closely matched dichotomized BBPS scores (ie, adequate vs inadequate). We tested the mean BBPS score based on the algorithm AI-BBPS against human rating using 30 independent 10-second video clips (test set 1) and 10 full withdrawal colonoscopy videos (test set 2).\nIn the validation set, the algorithm demonstrated an area under the curve of .918 and accuracy of 85.3% for detection of inadequate bowel cleanliness. In test set 1, sensitivity for inadequate bowel preparation was 100% and agreement between raters and AI was 76.7% to 83.3%. In test set 2, sensitivity for inadequate bowel preparation for each segment was 100% and agreement between raters and AI was 68.9% to 89.7%. Agreement between raters alone versus raters and AI were similar (\u03ba\u00a0= .694 and .649, respectively).\nThe algorithm assessment of bowel cleanliness as measured with the BBPS showed good performance and agreement with experts including full withdrawal colonoscopies.",

    "abstract": "The development of artificial intelligence (AI) began in the mid-20th century but has been rapidly accelerating in the past decade. Reflecting the development of digital health over the past few years, this trend is also seen in medicine. The field of cardiovascular medicine uses a wide variety and a large amount of biosignals, so there are many situations where AI can contribute. The development of AI is in progress for all aspects of the healthcare system, including the prevention, screening, and treatment of diseases and the prediction of the prognosis. AI is expected to be used to provide specialist-level medical care, even in a situation where medical resources are scarce. However, like other medical devices, the concept and mechanism of AI must be fully understood when used; otherwise, it may be used inappropriately, resulting in detriment to the patient. Therefore, it is important to understand what we need to know as a cardiologist handling AI. This review introduces the basics and principles of AI, then shows how far the current development of AI has come, and finally gives a brief introduction of how to start the AI development for those who want to develop their own AI.",

    "abstract": "To explore the value of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based application for identifying plaque-specific stenosis and obstructive coronary artery disease from monoenergetic spectral reconstructions on coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA).\nThis retrospective study enrolled 71 consecutive patients (52 men, 19 women; 63.3 \u00b1 10.7 years) who underwent coronary CTA and invasive coronary angiography for diagnosing coronary artery disease. The conventional 120 kVp images and eight different virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) (from 40 keV to 140 keV at increment of 10 keV) were reconstructed. An AI system automatically detected plaques from the conventional 120 kVp images and VMIs and calculated the degree of stenosis, which was further compared to invasive coronary angiography. The assessment was performed at a segment, vessel, and patient level.\nVessel and segment-based analyses showed comparable diagnostic performance between conventional CTA images and VMIs from 50 keV to 90 keV. For vessel-based analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy of conventional CTA were 74.3% (95% CI: 64.9%-82.0%), 85.6% (95% CI: 77.0%-91.4%), 84.3% (95% CI: 75.2%-90.7%), 76.1% (95% CI: 67.1%-83.3%) and 79.8% (95% CI: 73.7%-84.9%), respectively; the average sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy values of the VMIs ranging from 50 keV to 90 keV were 71.6%, 90.7%, 87.5%, 64.1% and 81.6%, respectively. For plaque-based assessment, diagnostic performance of the average VMIs ranging from 50 keV to 100 keV showed no significant statistical difference in diagnostic accuracy compared to those of conventional CTA images in detecting calcified (91.4% vs. 93.8%, p > 0.05), noncalcified (92.6% vs. 85.2%, p > 0.05) or mixed (80.2% vs. 81.2%, p > 0.05) stenosis, although the specificity was slightly higher (53.4% vs. 40.0%, p > 0.05) in detecting stenosis caused by mixed plaques. For VMIs above 100 keV, the diagnostic accuracy dropped significantly.\nOur study showed that the performance of an AI-based application employed to detect significant coronary stenosis in virtual monoenergetic reconstructions ranging from 50 keV to 90 keV was comparable to conventional 120 kVp reconstructions.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to evaluate AI chatbot characteristics, functions, and core conversational capacities and investigate whether AI chatbot interventions were effective in changing physical activity, healthy eating, weight management behaviors, and other related health outcomes.\nIn collaboration with a medical librarian, six electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, ACM Digital Library, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and IEEE) were searched to identify relevant studies. Only randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies were included. Studies were screened by two independent reviewers, and any discrepancy was resolved by a third reviewer. The National Institutes of Health quality assessment tools were used to assess risk of bias in individual studies. We applied the AI Chatbot Behavior Change Model to characterize components of chatbot interventions, including chatbot characteristics, persuasive and relational capacity, and evaluation of outcomes.\nThe database search retrieved 1692 citations, and 9 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of the 9 studies, 4 were randomized controlled trials and 5 were quasi-experimental studies. Five out of the seven studies suggest chatbot interventions are promising strategies in increasing physical activity. In contrast, the number of studies focusing on changing diet and weight status was limited. Outcome assessments, however, were reported inconsistently across the studies. Eighty-nine and thirty-three percent of the studies specified a name and gender (i.e., woman) of the chatbot, respectively. Over half (56%) of the studies used a constrained chatbot (i.e., rule-based), while the remaining studies used unconstrained chatbots that resemble human-to-human communication.\nChatbots may improve physical activity, but we were not able to make definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of chatbot interventions on physical activity, diet, and weight management/loss. Application of AI chatbots is an emerging field of research in lifestyle modification programs and is expected to grow exponentially. Thus, standardization of designing and reporting chatbot interventions is warranted in the near future.\nInternational Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO): CRD42020216761 .",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to build the supervised learning model to predict the state of cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and cognitive domains including memory, language, action, and visuospatial based on Digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT) precisely.\n207 normal controls, 242 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients, 87 dementia patients, including 53 AD patients, were selected from Shanghai Tongji Hospital. The electromagnetic tablets were used to collect the trajectory points of dCDT. By combining dynamic process and static results, different types of features were extracted, and the prediction models were built based on the feature selection approaches and machine learning methods.\nThe optimal AUC of cognitive impairment's screening, AD's screening and differentiation are 0.782, 0.919 and 0.818, respectively. In addition, the cognitive state of the domains with the best prediction result based on the features of dCDT is action with the optimal AUC 0.794, while the other three cognitive domains got the prediction results between 0.744-0.755.\nBy extracting dCDT features, cognitive impairment and AD patients can be identified early. Through dCDT feature extraction, a prediction model of single cognitive domain damage can be established.",

    "abstract": "There is no satisfactory indicator for monitoring recurrence after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This retrospective study aimed to design and validate an HCC monitor recurrence (HMR) model for patients without metastasis after hepatectomy.\nA training cohort was recruited from 1179 patients with HCC without metastasis after hepatectomy between February 2012 and December 2015. An HMR model was developed using an AdaBoost classifier algorithm. The factors included patient age, TNM staging, tumor size, and pre/postoperative dynamic variations of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). The diagnostic efficacy of the model was evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). The model was validated using a cohort of 695 patients.\nIn preoperative patients with positive or negative AFP, the AUC of the validation cohort in the HMR model was .8877, which indicated better diagnostic efficacy than that of serum AFP (AUC, .7348). The HMR model predicted recurrence earlier than computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging did by 191.58 \u00b1 165 days. In addition, the HMR model can predict the prognosis of patients with HCC after resection.\nThe HMR model established in this study is more accurate than serum AFP for monitoring recurrence after hepatectomy for HCC and can be used for real-time monitoring of the postoperative status in patients with HCC without metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Various studies have investigated cognitive mechanisms underlying culture in humans and other great apes. However, the adaptive reasons for the evolution of uniquely sophisticated cumulative culture in our species remain unclear. We propose that the cultural capabilities of humans are the evolutionary result of a stepwise transition from the ape-like lifestyle of earlier hominins to the foraging niche still observed in extant hunter-gatherers. Recent ethnographic, archaeological and genetic studies have provided compelling evidence that the components of the foraging niche (social egalitarianism, sexual and social division of labour, extensive co-residence and cooperation with unrelated individuals, multilocality, fluid sociality and high between-camp mobility) engendered a unique multilevel social structure where the cognitive mechanisms underlying cultural evolution (high-fidelity transmission, innovation, teaching, recombination, ratcheting) evolved as adaptations. Therefore, multilevel sociality underlies a 'social ratchet' or irreversible task specialization splitting the burden of cultural knowledge across individuals, which may explain why human collective intelligence is uniquely able to produce sophisticated cumulative culture. The foraging niche perspective may explain why a complex gene-culture dual inheritance system evolved uniquely in humans and interprets the cultural, morphological and genetic origins of ",

    "abstract": "This article shows that current ethics guidance documents and initiatives for artificial intelligence (AI) tend to be dominated by a principled approach to ethics. Although this brings value to the field, it also entails some risks, especially in relation to the abstraction of this form of ethics that makes it poorly equipped to engage with and address deep socio-political issues and the material impacts of AI. This is particularly problematic considering the risk for AI to further entrench already existing social inequalities and injustices and contribute to environmental damage. To respond to this challenge posed by AI ethics today, this article proposes to complement the existing principled approach with an approach to ethics as attention to context and relations. It does so by drawing from alternative ethical theories to the dominant principled one, especially the ethics of care or other feminist approaches to ethics. Related to this, it encourages the inclusion of social sciences and humanities in the development, deployment and use of AI, as well as in AI ethics discussions and initiatives. This article presents this proposal for an ethics as attention to context and formulates a series of practical recommendations to implement this proposal concretely.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) as an emerging technology is gaining momentum in medical imaging. Recently, deep learning-based AI techniques have been actively investigated in medical imaging, and its potential applications range from data acquisition and image reconstruction to image analysis and understanding. In this review, we focus on the use of deep learning in image reconstruction for advanced medical imaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET). Particularly, recent deep learning-based methods for image reconstruction will be emphasized, in accordance with their methodology designs and performances in handling volumetric imaging data. It is expected that this review can help relevant researchers understand how to adapt AI for medical imaging and which advantages can be achieved with the assistance of AI.",

    "abstract": "Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) re-humanize or de-humanize medicine? As AI becomes pervasive in clinical medicine, we argue that the ethical framework that sustains a responsible implementation of such technologies should be reconsidered. The emergence of AI in the clinical setting will challenge our traditional moral boundaries surrounding discussions of patient care since it is unclear how the implementation of AI will promote and enhance the humanistic dimensions of medical practice. There are reasons for concern regarding 1) the anthropological implications of AI in the clinical context; 2) the method(s) and framework(s) used to address ethical issues in medicine; and 3) the impact of AI on clinical practice, particularly in the nature of clinical judgment. These three concerns are examined in hopes of providing pointers for subsequent and more in-depth discussions regarding clinical practice but the training of future health professionals.",

    "abstract": "Our aim was to assess the tomographic presence of diabetic macular edema in type 2 diabetes patients screened for diabetic retinopathy with color fundus photographs and an artificial intelligence algorithm. Color fundus photographs obtained with a low-cost smartphone-based handheld retinal camera were analyzed by the algorithm; patients with suspected macular lesions underwent ocular coherence tomography. A total of 366 patients were screened; diabetic macular edema was suspected in 34 and confirmed in 29 individuals, with average age 60.5\u2009\u00b1\u200910.9\u00a0years and glycated hemoglobin 9.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4%; use of insulin, statins, and aspirin were reported in 44.8%, 37.9%, and 34.5% of individuals, respectively; systemic blood hypertension, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, chronic kidney disease, and risk for diabetic foot ulcers were present in 100%, 58.6%, 62.1%, 48.3%, and 27.5% of individuals, respectively. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy was present in 31% of patients with macular edema; severity level was associated with albuminuria (p\u2009=\u20090.028). Eyes with macular edema had average central macular thickness 329.89\u2009\u00b1\u200980.98\u00a0m[Formula: see text]; intraretinal cysts, sub retinal fluid, hyper-reflective foci, epiretinal membrane, and vitreomacular traction were found in 87.2%, 6.4%, 85.1%, 10.6%, and 6.4% of eyes, respectively. Diabetic retinopathy screening overwhelms health systems and is typically based on color fundus photographs, with high false-positive rates for the detection of diabetic macular edema. The present, semi-automated strategy comprising artificial intelligence algorithms integrated with smartphone-based retinal cameras could improve screening in low-resource settings with limited availability of ocular coherence tomography, allowing increased access rates and ultimately contributing to tackle preventable blindness.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have increasingly achieved expert-level performance in medical imaging applications. However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in historically under-served populations such as female patients, Black patients, or patients of low socioeconomic status. Such biases are especially troubling in the context of underdiagnosis, whereby the AI algorithm would inaccurately label an individual with a disease as healthy, potentially delaying access to care. Here, we examine algorithmic underdiagnosis in chest X-ray pathology classification across three large chest X-ray datasets, as well as one multi-source dataset. We find that classifiers produced using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques consistently and selectively underdiagnosed under-served patient populations and that the underdiagnosis rate was higher for intersectional under-served subpopulations, for example, Hispanic female patients. Deployment of AI systems using medical imaging for disease diagnosis with such biases risks exacerbation of existing care biases and can potentially lead to unequal access to medical treatment, thereby raising ethical concerns for the use of these models in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the effect of filtering (or modulating) the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time-series on intelligence metrics predicted using dynamic functional connectivity (dFC). Thirteen brain regions that have highest correlation with intelligence are selected and their corresponding time-series are filtered. Using filtered time-series, the modified intelligence metrics are predicted. This experiment investigates whether modulating the time-series of one or two regions of the brain will increase or decrease the fluid ability and fluid intelligence among healthy humans. Two sets of experiments are performed. In the first case, each of the thirteen regions is separately filtered using four different digital filters with passbands: i) 0 - 0.25\u03c0, ii) 0.25\u03c0 - 0.5\u03c0, iii) 0.5\u03c0 - 0.75\u03c0, and iv) 0.75\u03c0 - \u03c0, respectively. In the second case, two of the thirteen regions are filtered simultaneously using a low-pass filter of passband 0 - 0.25\u03c0. In both cases, the predicted intelligence declined for 45-65% of the subjects after filtering in comparison with the ground truths. In the first case, the low-pass filtering process had the highest predicted intelligence among the four filters. In the second case, it was noticed that the filtering of two regions simultaneously resulted in a higher prediction of intelligence for over 80% of the subjects compared to low-pass filtering of a single region.",

    "abstract": "Visual inspection of microscopic samples is still the gold standard diagnostic methodology for many global health diseases. Soil-transmitted helminth infection affects 1.5 billion people worldwide, and is the most prevalent disease among the Neglected Tropical Diseases. It is diagnosed by manual examination of stool samples by microscopy, which is a time-consuming task and requires trained personnel and high specialization. Artificial intelligence could automate this task making the diagnosis more accessible. Still, it needs a large amount of annotated training data coming from experts.In this work, we proposed the use of crowdsourced annotated medical images to train AI models (neural networks) for the detection of soil-transmitted helminthiasis in microscopy images from stool samples leveraging non-expert knowledge collected through playing a video game. We collected annotations made by both school-age children and adults, and we showed that, although the quality of crowdsourced annotations made by school-age children are sightly inferior than the ones made by adults, AI models trained on these crowdsourced annotations perform similarly (AUC of 0.928 and 0.939 respectively), and reach similar performance to the AI model trained on expert annotations (AUC of 0.932). We also showed the impact of the training sample size and continuous training on the performance of the AI models.In conclusion, the workflow proposed in this work combined collective and artificial intelligence for detecting soil-transmitted helminthiasis. Embedded within a digital health platform can be applied to any other medical image analysis task and contribute to reduce the burden of disease.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning and artificial intelligence have shown remarkable performance in accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cloud computing technologies have great advantages in building an easily accessible platform to deploy advanced algorithms. In this work, we develop an open-access, easy-to-use and high-performance medical intelligence cloud computing platform (XCloud-pFISTA) to reconstruct MRI images from undersampled k-space data. Two state-of-the-art approaches of the Projected Fast Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (pFISTA) family have been successfully implemented on the cloud. This work can be considered as a good example of cloud-based medical image reconstruction and may benefit the future development of integrated reconstruction and online diagnosis system.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease that causes airflow limitation to the lungs and has a high morbidity around the world. The objective of this study was to evaluate how artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied for the management of the disease, analyzing the objectives that are raised, the algorithms that are used and what results they offer.\nWe conducted a scoping review following the Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and Levac et al. (2010) guidelines. Two reviewers independently searched, analyzed and extracted data from papers of five databases: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cinahl and Cochrane. To be included, the studies had to apply some AI techniques for the management of at least one stage of the COPD clinical process. In the event of any discrepancy between both reviewers, the criterion of a third reviewer prevailed.\n380 papers were identified through database searches. After applying the exclusion criteria, 67 papers were included in the study. The studies were of a different nature and pursued a wide range of objectives, highlighting mainly those focused on the identification, classification and prevention of the disease. Neural nets, support vector machines and decision trees were the AI algorithms most commonly used. The mean and median values of all the performance metrics evaluated were between 80% and 90%.\nThe results obtained show a growing interest in the development of medical applications that manage the different phases of the COPD clinical process, especially predictive models. According to the performance shown, these models could be a useful complementary tool in the decision-making by health specialists, although more high-quality ML studies are needed to endorse the findings of this study.",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma can affect the complete skeleton, which makes whole-body imaging necessary. With the current assessment of these complex datasets by radiologists, only a\u00a0small part of the accessible information is assessed and reported.\nDepending on the question and availability, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET) is performed and the results are then visually examined by radiologists.\nA\u00a0combination of automatic skeletal segmentation using artificial intelligence and subsequent radiomics analysis of each individual bone have the potential to provide automatic, comprehensive, and objective skeletal analyses.\nA\u00a0few automatic skeletal segmentation algorithms for CT already show promising results. In addition, first studies indicate correlations between radiomics features of bone and bone marrow with established disease markers and therapy response.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics algorithms for automatic skeletal analysis from whole-body imaging are currently in an early phase of development.\nKLINISCHES/METHODISCHES PROBLEM: Das Multiple Myelom kann mit Pr\u00e4disposition des Axialskeletts das gesamte Skelettsystem betreffen, folglich kommen Ganzk\u00f6rperbildgebungsverfahren zum Einsatz.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL)-based artificial intelligence may have different diagnostic characteristics than human experts in medical diagnosis. As a data-driven knowledge system, heterogeneous population incidence in the clinical world is considered to cause more bias to DL than clinicians. Conversely, by experiencing limited numbers of cases, human experts may exhibit large interindividual variability. Thus, understanding how the 2 groups classify given data differently is an essential step for the cooperative usage of DL in clinical application.\nThis study aimed to evaluate and compare the differential effects of clinical experience in otoendoscopic image diagnosis in both computers and physicians exemplified by the class imbalance problem and guide clinicians when utilizing decision support systems.\nWe used digital otoendoscopic images of patients who visited the outpatient clinic in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at Severance Hospital, Seoul, South Korea, from January 2013 to June 2019, for a total of 22,707 otoendoscopic images. We excluded similar images, and 7500 otoendoscopic images were selected for labeling. We built a DL-based image classification model to classify the given image into 6 disease categories. Two test sets of 300 images were populated: balanced and imbalanced test sets. We included 14 clinicians (otolaryngologists and nonotolaryngology specialists including general practitioners) and 13 DL-based models. We used accuracy (overall and per-class) and kappa statistics to compare the results of individual physicians and the ML models.\nOur ML models had consistently high accuracies (balanced test set: mean 77.14%, SD 1.83%; imbalanced test set: mean 82.03%, SD 3.06%), equivalent to those of otolaryngologists (balanced: mean 71.17%, SD 3.37%; imbalanced: mean 72.84%, SD 6.41%) and far better than those of nonotolaryngologists (balanced: mean 45.63%, SD 7.89%; imbalanced: mean 44.08%, SD 15.83%). However, ML models suffered from class imbalance problems (balanced test set: mean 77.14%, SD 1.83%; imbalanced test set: mean 82.03%, SD 3.06%). This was mitigated by data augmentation, particularly for low incidence classes, but rare disease classes still had low per-class accuracies. Human physicians, despite being less affected by prevalence, showed high interphysician variability (ML models: kappa=0.83, SD 0.02; otolaryngologists: kappa=0.60, SD 0.07).\nEven though ML models deliver excellent performance in classifying ear disease, physicians and ML models have their own strengths. ML models have consistent and high accuracy while considering only the given image and show bias toward prevalence, whereas human physicians have varying performance but do not show bias toward prevalence and may also consider extra information that is not images. To deliver the best patient care in the shortage of otolaryngologists, our ML model can serve a cooperative role for clinicians with diverse expertise, as long as it is kept in mind that models consider only images and could be biased toward prevalent diseases even after data augmentation.",

This was mitigated by data augmentation, particularly for low incidence classes, but rare disease classes still had low per-class accuracies.

    "abstract": "An explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) approach is proposed to longitudinally monitor subjects affected by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) by using high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG). To this end, a group of MCI patients was enrolled at IRCCS Centro Neurolesi Bonino Pulejo of Messina (Italy) within a follow-up protocol that included two evaluations steps: T0 (first evaluation) and T1 (three months later). At T1, four MCI patients converted to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and were included in the analysis as the goal of this work was to use xAI to detect individual changes in EEGs possibly related to the degeneration from MCI to AD. The proposed methodology consists in mapping segments of HD-EEG into channel-frequency maps by means of the power spectral density. Such maps are used as input to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), trained to label the maps as \"T0\" (MCI state) or \"T1\" (AD state). Experimental results reported high intra-subject classification performance (accuracy rate up to 98.97% (95% confidence interval: 98.68-99.26)). Subsequently, the explainability of the proposed CNN is explored via a Grad-CAM approach. The procedure detected which EEG-channels (i.e., head region) and range of frequencies (i.e., sub-bands) were more active in the progression to AD. The xAI analysis showed that the main information is included in the delta sub-band and that, limited to the analyzed dataset, the highest relevant areas are: the left-temporal and central-frontal lobe for Sb01, the parietal lobe for Sb02, the left-frontal lobe for Sb03 and the left-frontotemporal region for Sb04.",

    "abstract": "Patients with schizophrenia can exhibit intelligence decline, which is an important element of cognitive impairment. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia have altered gray matter structures and functional connectivity associated with intelligence decline defined by a difference between premorbid and current intelligence quotients (IQs). However, it has remained unclear whether white matter microstructures are related to intelligence decline. In the present study, the indices of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) obtained from 138 patients with schizophrenia and 554 healthy controls were analyzed. The patients were classified into three subgroups based on intelligence decline: deteriorated (94 patients), preserved (42 patients), and compromised IQ (2 patients) groups. Given that the DTI of each subject was acquired using either one of two different MRI scanners, we analyzed DTI indices separately for each scanner group. In the comparison between the deteriorated IQ group and the healthy controls, differences in some DTI indices were noted in three regions of interest irrespective of the MRI scanners, whereas differences in only one region of interest were noted between the preserved IQ group and the healthy controls. However, the comparisons between the deteriorated and preserved IQ groups did not show any reproducible differences. Together with the previous findings, it is thought that gray matter structures and functional connectivity are more promising as markers of intelligence decline in schizophrenia than white matter microstructures.",

    "abstract": "To predict visual acuity (VA) and post-therapeutic optical coherence tomography (OCT) images 1, 3, and 6\u00a0months after laser treatment in patients with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) by artificial intelligence (AI). Real-world clinical and imaging data were collected at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (ZOC) and Xiamen Eye Center (XEC). The data obtained from ZOC (416 eyes of 401 patients) were used as the training set; the data obtained from XEC (64 eyes of 60 patients) were used as the test set. Six different machine learning algorithms and a blending algorithm were used to predict VA, and a pix2pixHD method was adopted to predict post-therapeutic OCT images in patients after laser treatment. The data for VA predictions included clinical features obtained from electronic medical records (20 features) and measured features obtained from fundus fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, and OCT (145 features). The data for OCT predictions included 480 pairs of pre- and post-therapeutic OCT images. The VA and OCT images predicted by AI were compared with the ground truth. In the VA predictions of XEC dataset, the mean absolute errors (MAEs) were 0.074-0.098 logMAR (within four to five letters), and the root mean square errors were 0.096-0.127 logMAR (within five to seven letters) for the 1-, 3-, and 6-month predictions, respectively; in the post-therapeutic OCT predictions, only about 5.15% (5 of 97) of synthetic OCT images could be accurately identified as synthetic images. The MAEs of central macular thickness of synthetic OCT images were 30.15 \u00b1 13.28\u00a0\u03bcm and 22.46 \u00b1 9.71\u00a0\u03bcm for the 1- and 3-month predictions, respectively. This is the first study to apply AI to predict VA and post-therapeutic OCT of patients with CSC. This work establishes a reliable method of predicting prognosis 6\u00a0months in advance; the application of AI has the potential to help reduce patient anxiety and serve as a reference for ophthalmologists when choosing optimal laser treatments.",

    "abstract": "Modern conformal beam delivery techniques require image-guidance to ensure the prescribed dose to be delivered as planned. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have greatly augmented our ability to accurately localize the treatment target while sparing the normal tissues. In this paper, we review the applications of AI-based algorithms in image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), and discuss the indications of these applications to the future of clinical practice of radiotherapy. The benefits, limitations and some important trends in research and development of the AI-based IGRT techniques are also discussed. AI-based IGRT techniques have the potential to monitor tumor motion, reduce treatment uncertainty and improve treatment precision. Particularly, these techniques also allow more healthy tissue to be spared while keeping tumor coverage the same or even better.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to methods that improve and automate challenging human tasks by systematically capturing and applying relevant knowledge in these tasks. Over the past decades, a number of approaches have been developed to address different types and needs of system intelligence ranging from search strategies to knowledge representation and inference to robotic planning. In the context of radiation treatment planning, multiple AI approaches may be adopted to improve the planning quality and efficiency. For example, knowledge representation and inference methods may improve dose prescription by integrating and reasoning about the domain knowledge described in many clinical guidelines and clinical trials reports. In this review, we will focus on the most studied AI approach in intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)/volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)-machine learning (ML) and describe our recent efforts in applying ML to improve the quality, consistency, and efficiency of IMRT/VMAT planning. With the available high-quality data, we can build models to accurately predict critical variables for each step of the planning process and thus automate and improve its outcomes. Specific to the IMRT/VMAT planning process, we can build models for each of the four critical components in the process: dose-volume histogram (DVH), Dose, Fluence, and Human Planner. These models can be divided into two general groups. The first group focuses on encoding prior experience and knowledge through ML and more recently deep learning (DL) from prior clinical plans and using these models to predict the optimal DVH (DVH prediction model), or 3D dose distribution (dose prediction model), or fluence map (fluence map model). The goal of these models is to reduce or remove the trial-and-error process and guarantee consistently high-quality plans. The second group of models focuses on mimicking human planners' decision-making process (planning strategy model) during the iterative adjustments/guidance of the optimization engine. Each critical step of the IMRT/VMAT treatment planning process can be improved and automated by AI methods. As more training data becomes available and more sophisticated models are developed, we can expect that the AI methods in treatment planning will continue to improve accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) based radiotherapy treatment planning tools have gained interest in automating the treatment planning process. It is essential to understand their overall robustness in various clinical scenarios. This is an existing gap between many AI based tools and their actual clinical deployment. This study works to fill the gap for AI based treatment planning by investigating a clinical robustness assessment (CRA) tool for the AI based planning methods using a phantom simulation approach.\nA cylindrical phantom was created in the treatment planning system (TPS) with the axial dimension of 30 cm by 18 cm. Key structures involved in pancreas stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) including PTV25, PTV33, C-Loop, stomach, bowel and liver were created within the phantom. Several simulation scenarios were created to mimic multiple scenarios of anatomical changes, including displacement, expansion, rotation and combination of three. The goal of treatment planning was to deliver 25 Gy to PTV25 and 33 Gy to PTV33 in 5 fractions in simultaneous integral boost (SIB) manner while limiting luminal organ-at-risk (OAR) max dose to be under 29 Gy. A previously developed deep learning based AI treatment planning tool for pancreas SBRT was identified as the validation object. For each scenario, the anatomy information was fed into the AI tool and the final fluence map associated to the plan was generated, which was subsequently sent to TPS for leaf sequencing and dose calculation. The final auto plan's quality was analyzed against the treatment planning constraint. The final plans' quality was further analyzed to evaluate potential correlation with anatomical changes using the Manhattan plot.\nA total of 32 scenarios were simulated in this study. For all scenarios, the mean PTV25 V25Gy of the AI based auto plans was 96.7% while mean PTV33 V33Gy was 82.2%. Large variation (16.3%) in PTV33 V33Gy was observed due to anatomical variations, a.k.a. proximity of luminal structure to PTV33. Mean max dose was 28.55, 27.68 and 24.63 Gy for C-Loop, bowel and stomach, respectively. Using D\nThe results showed promising robustness of the pancreas SBRT AI tool, providing important evidence of its readiness for clinical implementation. The established workflow could guide the process of assuring clinical readiness of future AI based treatment planning tools.",

    "abstract": "In the radiotherapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used to delineate tumor area more accurately. While MRI offers the higher soft tissue contrast, patient positioning and couch correction based on bony image fusion of computed tomography (CT) is also necessary. There is thus an urgent need to obtain a high image contrast between bone and soft tissue to facilitate target delineation and patient positioning for NPC radiotherapy. In this paper, our aim is to develop a novel image conversion between the CT and MRI modalities to obtain clear bone and soft tissue images simultaneously, here called bone-enhanced MRI (BeMRI).\nThirty-five patients were retrospectively selected for this study. All patients underwent clinical CT simulation and 1.5T MRI within the same week in Shenzhen Second People's Hospital. To synthesize BeMRI, two deep learning networks, U-Net and CycleGAN, were constructed to transform MRI to synthetic CT (sCT) images. Each network used 28 patients' images as the training set, while the remaining 7 patients were used as the test set (~1/5 of all datasets). The bone structure from the sCT was then extracted by the threshold-based method and embedded in the corresponding part of the MRI image to generate the BeMRI image. To evaluate the performance of these networks, the following metrics were applied: mean absolute error (MAE), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).\nIn our experiments, both deep learning models achieved good performance and were able to effectively extract bone structure from MRI. Specifically, the supervised U-Net model achieved the best results with the lowest overall average MAE of 125.55 (P<0.05) and produced the highest SSIM of 0.89 and PSNR of 23.84. These results indicate that BeMRI can display bone structure in higher contrast than conventional MRI.\nA new image modality BeMRI, which is a composite image of CT and MRI, was proposed. With high image contrast of both bone structure and soft tissues, BeMRI will facilitate tumor localization and patient positioning and eliminate the need to frequently check between separate MRI and CT images during NPC radiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to explore the effects of Gamma nail internal fixation for intertrochanteric fracture of femur by X-ray film classification and recognition method based on artificial intelligence algorithm. The study subjects were 100 elderly patients with intertrochanteric fracture of femur admitted to hospital. The cases were diagnosed as elderly (over 60 years old) femoral intertrochanteric fractures by X-ray or CT. They were divided into two groups, with 50 persons in each group: one group used the X-ray film evaluation image guidance based on the artificial intelligence algorithm (research group), and the other group did not use algorithmic guidance (control group). The results showed that the segmentation effect of the proposed algorithm was similar to the gold standard segmentation result, indicating that the algorithm was effective and feasible in the segmentation of fractures and bones. The global level set algorithm was set as the control. The ultimate measurement accuracy (UMA) value of the algorithm group was (1.77 \u00b1 0.22), and the UMA value of the global level set algorithm group was (3.42 \u00b1 0.36), indicating that the image processed by the algorithm group had obvious numerical effect, high accuracy, and good retention of details. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, incision length, hospital stay, weight-bearing time, and fracture healing time of the two groups were all better than those of the control group. One month after surgery, the Harris score of the algorithm group was 67, and that of the control group was 51, with a 16-point difference between the two groups (",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains the most lethal type of cancer. The 5-year survival rate for patients with early-stage diagnosis can be as high as 20%, suggesting that early diagnosis plays a pivotal role in the prognostic improvement of PDAC cases. In the medical field, the broad availability of biomedical data has led to the advent of the \"big data\" era. To overcome this deadly disease, how to fully exploit big data is a new challenge in the era of precision medicine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a machine to learn and display intelligence to solve problems. AI can help to transform big data into clinically actionable insights more efficiently, reduce inevitable errors to improve diagnostic accuracy, and make real-time predictions. AI-based omics analyses will become the next alterative approach to overcome this poor-prognostic disease by discovering biomarkers for early detection, providing molecular/genomic subtyping, offering treatment guidance, and predicting recurrence and survival. Advances in AI may therefore improve PDAC survival outcomes in the near future. The present review mainly focuses on recent advances of AI in PDAC for clinicians. We believe that breakthroughs will soon emerge to fight this deadly disease using AI-navigated precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) has numerous health benefits. Personalized coaching may increase adherence to PA recommendations, but it is challenging to deliver personalized coaching in a scalable manner. The objective of our study was to determine whether novel artificially intelligent (AI) coaching interventions increase PA among overweight or obese, physically inactive cancer survivors compared to a control arm that receives health information. We conducted a single-center, three-arm randomized trial with equal allocation to (1) voice-assisted AI coaching delivered by smart speaker (MyCoach), (2) autonomous AI coaching delivered by text message (SmartText), and (3) control. Data collection was automated via sensors and voice technology, effectively masking outcome ascertainment. The primary outcome was change in mean steps per day from baseline to the end of follow-up at 4 weeks. Of the 42 randomized participants, 91% were female, and 36% were Black; mean age was 62.1 years, and mean BMI was 32.9\u2009kg/m",

    "abstract": "Radiation therapy is a complex process involving multiple professionals and steps from simulation to treatment planning to delivery, and these procedures are prone to error. Additionally, the imaging and treatment delivery equipment in radiotherapy is highly complex and interconnected and represents another risk point in the quality of care. Numerous quality assurance tasks are carried out to ensure quality and to detect and prevent potential errors in the process of care. Recent developments in artificial intelligence provide potential tools to the radiation oncology community to improve the efficiency and performance of quality assurance efforts. Targets for artificial intelligence enhancement include the quality assurance of treatment plans, target and tissue structure delineation used in the plans, delivery of the plans and the radiotherapy delivery equipment itself. Here we review recent developments of artificial intelligence applications that aim to improve quality assurance processes in radiation therapy and discuss some of the challenges and limitations that require further development work to realise the potential of artificial intelligence for quality assurance.",

    "abstract": "Wide-ranging concerns exist regarding the use of black-box modelling methods in sensitive contexts such as healthcare. Despite performance gains and hype, uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) is hindered by these concerns. Explainable AI is thought to help alleviate these concerns. However, existing definitions for explainable are not forming a solid foundation for this work.\nWe critique recent reviews on the literature regarding: the agency of an AI within a team; mental models, especially as they apply to healthcare, and the practical aspects of their elicitation; and existing and current definitions of explainability, especially from the perspective of AI researchers. On the basis of this literature, we create a new definition of explainable, and supporting terms, providing definitions that can be objectively evaluated. Finally, we apply the new definition of explainable to three existing models, demonstrating how it can apply to previous research, and providing guidance for future research on the basis of this definition.\nExisting definitions of explanation are premised on global applicability and don't address the question 'understandable by whom?'. Eliciting mental models can be likened to creating explainable AI if one considers the AI as a member of a team. On this basis, we define explainability in terms of the context of the model, comprising the purpose, audience, and language of the model and explanation. As examples, this definition is applied to regression models, neural nets, and human mental models in operating-room teams.\nExisting definitions of explanation have limitations for ensuring that the concerns for practical applications are resolved. Defining explainability in terms of the context of their application forces evaluations to be aligned with the practical goals of the model. Further, it will allow researchers to explicitly distinguish between explanations for technical and lay audiences, allowing different evaluations to be applied to each.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine relationships and group differences among adult people's (aged 18-74) physical activity (PA), expression of stress, depression, emotional intelligence (EI), logical thinking (LT), and overall health assessment. Two hypotheses were formulated before the study. The first hypothesis is that overweight and obesity in young adults (18 to 34 years) females and males, in particular, should increase sharply and this should be associated with decreased PA, abruptly deteriorating subject health, increased stress, depression, and poorer emotion management and EI. Second hypothesis: We further thought that the better people's reflective thinking, the more they should live a healthier life (e.g., exercise more and eat healthier), their overweight and obesity should be small or none. We aimed to confirm or reject these two hypotheses. We applied a quantitative cross-sectional study design. The study results revealed that during the lifespan of 18-24 and 25-34 years (young adults) there was a sharp increase in overweight and obesity, a decrease in PA (and especially vigorous physical activity (VPA)) (and this was particularly evident in the male), while research participants felt less stress and depression, subjective assessment of health did not change, and EI increased steadily with age (18-24 to 65-74 years). The higher the EI of the research participants from 18-24 to 65-74 years of age the higher their moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), the less stress and depression they felt. Based on the results, it can be said that both females and males prefer PA \"with a hot heart rather than a cold mind.\" We base this conclusion on the fact that females and males who have the highest EI also have the highest MVPA while LT is not associated with MVPA.",

    "abstract": "Although the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is still in its early stages, it is important to understand the factors influencing its adoption. Using a qualitative multi-case study of three hospitals in China, we explored the research of factors affecting AI adoption from a social power perspective with consideration of the learning algorithm abilities of AI systems. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, participative observations, and document analysis, and analyzed using NVivo 11. We classified six social powers into knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based power structures, revealing a social power pattern related to the learning algorithm ability of AI.",

    "abstract": "Several indicators are strongly related to health and well-being in university students, such as emotional intelligence and physical activity. At the same time, some qualities threaten it and are incompatible with students' adaptation to society in general, such as aggressive behaviours. The aim of this research is to analyse the relationship established between emotional intelligence using TMMS-24, physical activity, using IPAQ, and aggression behaviours in university students. For this purpose, a descriptive, cross-sectional and non-experimental study was developed with 932 undergraduates (M = 20.55; SD = 3.673). The findings highlight how emotional intelligence and physical activity practice decrease violent behaviour in university students. In addition, men tend to have more aggressive behaviours than women as well as the relation between physical activity and emotional intelligence is stronger in all its dimensions. Results highlight the importance of including emotional intelligence programs in order to enable undergraduate well-being.",

    "abstract": "The future of healthcare is an organic blend of technology, innovation, and human connection. As artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually becoming a go-to technology in healthcare to improve efficiency and outcomes, we must understand our limitations. We should realize that our goal is not only to provide faster and more efficient care, but also to deliver an integrated solution to ensure that the care is fair and not biased to a group of sub-population. In this context, the field of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, which encompasses a wide range of conditions-from heart failure to stroke-has made some advances to provide assistive tools to care providers. This article aimed to provide an overall thematic review of recent development focusing on various AI applications in cardio-cerebrovascular diseases to identify gaps and potential areas of improvement. If well designed, technological engines have the potential to improve healthcare access and equitability while reducing overall costs, diagnostic errors, and disparity in a system that affects patients and providers and strives for efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising results in digestive endoscopy, especially in capsule endoscopy (CE). However, some physicians still have some difficulties and fear the advent of this technology. We aimed to evaluate the perceptions and current sentiments toward the use of AI in CE. An online survey questionnaire was sent to an audience of gastroenterologists. In addition, several European national leaders of the International CApsule endoscopy REsearch (I CARE) Group were asked to disseminate an online survey among their national communities of CE readers (CER). The survey included 32 questions regarding general information, perceptions of AI, and its use in daily life, medicine, endoscopy, and CE. Among 380 European gastroenterologists who answered this survey, 333 (88%) were CERs. The mean average time length of experience in CE reading was 9.9 years (0.5-22). A majority of CERs agreed that AI would positively impact CE, shorten CE reading time, and help standardize reporting in CE and characterize lesions seen in CE. Nevertheless, in the foreseeable future, a majority of CERs disagreed with the complete replacement all CE reading by AI. Most CERs believed in the high potential of AI for becoming a valuable tool for automated diagnosis and for shortening the reading time. Currently, the perception is that AI will not replace CE reading.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasonic guided waves are sensitive to many different types of defects and have been studied for defect recognition in rail. However, most fault recognition algorithms need to extract features from the time domain, frequency domain, or time-frequency domain based on experience or professional knowledge. This paper proposes a new method for identifying many different types of rail defects. The segment principal components analysis (S-PCA) is developed to extract characteristics from signals collected by sensors located at different positions. Then, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is used to identify different defects depending on the features extracted. Combining simulations and experiments of the rails with different kinds of defects are established to verify the effectiveness of the proposed defect identification techniques, such as crack, corrosion, and transverse crack under the shelling. There are nine channels of the excitation-reception to acquire guided wave detection signals. The results show that the defect classification accuracy rates are 96.29% and 96.15% for combining multiple signals, such as the method of single-point excitation and multi-point reception, or the method of multi-point excitation and reception at a single point.",

    "abstract": "The global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused millions of deaths and affected the livelihood of many more people. Early and rapid detection of COVID-19 is a challenging task for the medical community, but it is also crucial in stopping the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Prior substantiation of artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields of science has encouraged researchers to further address this problem. Various medical imaging modalities including X-ray, computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) using AI techniques have greatly helped to curb the COVID-19 outbreak by assisting with early diagnosis. We carried out a systematic review on state-of-the-art AI techniques applied with X-ray, CT, and US images to detect COVID-19. In this paper, we discuss approaches used by various authors and the significance of these research efforts, the potential challenges, and future trends related to the implementation of an AI system for disease detection during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common cancer in children, and its diagnosis mainly includes microscopic blood tests of the bone marrow. Therefore, there is a need for a correct classification of white blood cells. The approach developed in this article is based on an optimized and small IoT-friendly neural network architecture. The application of learning transfer in hybrid artificial intelligence systems is offered. The hybrid system consisted of a MobileNet v2 encoder pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and machine learning algorithms performing the role of the head. These were the XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms. In this work, the average accuracy was over 90%, reaching 97.4%. This work proves that using hybrid artificial intelligence systems for tasks with a low computational complexity of the processing units demonstrates a high classification accuracy. The methods used in this study, confirmed by the promising results, can be an effective tool in diagnosing other blood diseases, facilitating the work of a network of medical institutions to carry out the correct treatment schedule.",

    "abstract": "Surveys on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are related to biology, clinical trials, fintech management, medicine, neurorobotics, and psychology, among others. Prognostics and health management (PHM) is the discipline that links the studies of failure mechanisms to system lifecycle management. There is a need, which is still absent, to produce an analytical compilation of PHM-XAI works. In this paper, we use preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) to present a state of the art on XAI applied to PHM of industrial assets. This work provides an overview of the trend of XAI in PHM and answers the question of accuracy versus explainability, considering the extent of human involvement, explanation assessment, and uncertainty quantification in this topic. Research articles associated with the subject, since 2015 to 2021, were selected from five databases following the PRISMA methodology, several of them related to sensors. The data were extracted from selected articles and examined obtaining diverse findings that were synthesized as follows. First, while the discipline is still young, the analysis indicates a growing acceptance of XAI in PHM. Second, XAI offers dual advantages, where it is assimilated as a tool to execute PHM tasks and explain diagnostic and anomaly detection activities, implying a real need for XAI in PHM. Third, the review shows that PHM-XAI papers provide interesting results, suggesting that the PHM performance is unaffected by the XAI. Fourth, human role, evaluation metrics, and uncertainty management are areas requiring further attention by the PHM community. Adequate assessment metrics to cater to PHM needs are requested. Finally, most case studies featured in the considered articles are based on real industrial data, and some of them are related to sensors, showing that the available PHM-XAI blends solve real-world challenges, increasing the confidence in the artificial intelligence models' adoption in the industry.",

In this study, we developed an autonomous navigation robot capable of recognizing objects and locations with a high probability of contamination and capable of providing quantified sterilization effects. In order to quantify the 99.9% sterilization effect of various bacterial strains, as representative contaminants with robots operated under different modules, the operating parameters of the moving speed, distance between the sample and the robot, and the radiation angle were determined. We anticipate that the sterilization effect data we obtained with our disinfection robot, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time, will serve as a type of stepping stone, leading to practical applications at various sites requiring disinfection.",

This study aimed to investigate the impact that the types of information as well as agents have on perceptions of privacy risks and concerns. The results showed that participants perceived privacy risk and were most concerned when they were asked to provide digital life information, followed by being asked for digital footprint information, and even more so when they were asked to provide this information to a human agent instead of an artificial intelligence agent. However, there were no differences in the perception of privacy risks and concerns with respect to self-expression and demographic information. The implications of these findings are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated the Danish secular trend of intelligence test scores among young men born between 1940 and 2000, as well as the possible associations of birth cohort changes in family size, nutrition, education, and intelligence test score variability with the increasing secular trend. The study population included all men born from 1940 to 2000 who appeared before a draft board before 2020 (N = 1,556,770). At the mandatory draft board examination, the approximately 19-year-old men underwent a medical examination and an intelligence test. In the statistical analyses, the IQ mean and standard deviation (SD) were estimated separately for each of the included annual birth cohorts based on information from birth cohorts with available total intelligence test scores for all tested individuals (i.e. 1940-1958 and 1987-2000; the mean and SD were interpolated for the intermediate birth cohorts). Moreover, the possible associations with birth cohort changes in family size, height as a proxy for nutritional status, education, and IQ variability were investigated among those birth cohorts for whom a secular increase in intelligence test scores was found. The results showed that the estimated mean IQ score increased from a baseline set to 100 (SD: 15) among individuals born in 1940 to 108.9 (SD: 12.2) among individuals born in 1980, since when it has decreased. Focusing on the birth cohorts of 1940-1980, for whom a secular increase in intelligence test scores was found, birth cohort changes in family size, height, and education explained large proportions of the birth cohort variance in mean intelligence test scores, suggesting that these factors may be important contributors to the observed Flynn effect in Denmark.",

    "abstract": "Drug repositioning aims to reuse existing drugs, shelved drugs, or drug candidates that failed clinical trials for other medical indications. Its attraction is sprung from the reduction in risk associated with safety testing of new medications and the time to get a known drug into the clinics. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been recently pursued to speed up drug repositioning and discovery. The essence of AI in drug repositioning is to unify the knowledge and actions, i.e. incorporating real-world and experimental data to map out the best way forward to identify effective therapeutics against a disease. In this review, we share positive expectations for the evolution of AI and drug repositioning and summarize the role of AI in several methods of drug repositioning.",

    "abstract": "A targeted cancer therapy is only useful if there is a way to accurately identify the tumors that are susceptible to that therapy. Thus rapid expansion in the number of available targeted cancer treatments has been accompanied by a robust effort to subdivide the traditional histological and anatomical tumor classifications into molecularly defined subtypes. This review highlights the history of the paired evolution of targeted therapies and biomarkers, reviews currently used methods for subtype identification, and discusses challenges to the implementation of precision oncology as well as possible solutions.",

    "abstract": "Validating artificial intelligence algorithms for clinical use in medical images is a challenging endeavor due to a lack of standard reference data (ground truth). This topic typically occupies a small portion of the discussion in research papers since most of the efforts are focused on developing novel algorithms. In this work, we present a collaboration to create a validation dataset of pathologist annotations for algorithms that process whole slide images. We focus on data collection and evaluation of algorithm performance in the context of estimating the density of stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) in breast cancer.\nWe digitized 64 glass slides of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained invasive ductal carcinoma core biopsies prepared at a single clinical site. A collaborating pathologist selected 10 regions of interest (ROIs) per slide for evaluation. We created training materials and workflows to crowdsource pathologist image annotations on two modes: an optical microscope and two digital platforms. The microscope platform allows the same ROIs to be evaluated in both modes. The workflows collect the ROI type, a decision on whether the ROI is appropriate for estimating the density of sTILs, and if appropriate, the sTIL density value for that ROI.\nIn total, 19 pathologists made 1645 ROI evaluations during a data collection event and the following 2 weeks. The pilot study yielded an abundant number of cases with nominal sTIL infiltration. Furthermore, we found that the sTIL densities are correlated within a case, and there is notable pathologist variability. Consequently, we outline plans to improve our ROI and case sampling methods. We also outline statistical methods to account for ROI correlations within a case and pathologist variability when validating an algorithm.\nWe have built workflows for efficient data collection and tested them in a pilot study. As we prepare for pivotal studies, we will investigate methods to use the dataset as an external validation tool for algorithms. We will also consider what it will take for the dataset to be fit for a regulatory purpose: study size, patient population, and pathologist training and qualifications. To this end, we will elicit feedback from the Food and Drug Administration via the Medical Device Development Tool program and from the broader digital pathology and AI community. Ultimately, we intend to share the dataset, statistical methods, and lessons learned.",

As we prepare for pivotal studies, we will investigate methods to use the dataset as an external validation tool for algorithms. We will also consider what it will take for the dataset to be fit for a regulatory purpose: study size, patient population, and pathologist training and qualifications. To this end, we will elicit feedback from the Food and Drug Administration via the Medical Device Development Tool program and from the broader digital pathology and AI community. Ultimately, we intend to share the dataset, statistical methods, and lessons learned.",

    "results": "In total, 19 pathologists made 1645 ROI evaluations during a data collection event and the following 2 weeks. The pilot study yielded an abundant number of cases with nominal sTIL infiltration. Furthermore, we found that the sTIL densities are correlated within a case, and there is notable pathologist variability. Consequently, we outline plans to improve our ROI and case sampling methods. We also outline statistical methods to account for ROI correlations within a case and pathologist variability when validating an algorithm.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of artificial intelligence algorithm combined with ultrasound endoscopy in early esophageal cancer and precancerous lesions by comparing the examination of conventional endoscopy and artificial intelligence algorithm combined with ultrasound endoscopy, and by comparing the real-time diagnosis of endoscopy and the ultrasonic image characteristics of artificial intelligence algorithm combined with endoscopic detection and pathological results. 120 cases were selected. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 80 patients who met the criteria were selected and randomly divided into two groups: endoscopic examination combined with ultrasound imaging based on intelligent algorithm processing (cascade region-convolutional neural network (Cascade RCNN) model algorithm group) and simple use of endoscopy group (control group). This study shows that the ultrasonic image of artificial intelligence algorithm is effective, and the detection performance is better than that of endoscopic detection. The results are close to the gold standard of doctor recognition, and the detection time is greatly shortened, and the recognition time is shortened by 71 frames per second. Compared with the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm, the accuracy and recall of image analysis and segmentation using feature pyramid network are increased. The detection rates of CNN model, Cascade RCNN model, and endoscopic detection alone in early esophageal cancer and precancerous lesions are 56.3% (45/80), 88.8% (71/80), and 44.1% (35/80), respectively. The detection rate of Cascade RCNN model and CNN model was higher than that of endoscopy alone, and the difference was statistically significant (",

    "abstract": "Imaging datasets in cancer research are growing exponentially in both quantity and information density. These massive datasets may enable derivation of insights for cancer research and clinical care, but only if researchers are equipped with the tools to leverage advanced computational analysis approaches such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this work, we highlight three themes to guide development of such computational tools: scalability, standardization, and ease of use. We then apply these principles to develop PathML, a general-purpose research toolkit for computational pathology. We describe the design of the PathML framework and demonstrate applications in diverse use cases. PathML is publicly available at www.pathml.com.",

    "abstract": "Use of prostate MRI has increased greatly in the past decade, primarily in directing targeted prostate biopsy. However, prostate MRI interpretation remains prone to interreader variation. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to standardize detection of lesions on MRI that are suspicious for prostate cancer (PCa). The purpose of this review is to explore the current status of AI for the automated detection of PCa on MRI. Recent literature describing promising results regarding AI models for PCa detection on MRI is highlighted. Numerous limitations of the existing literature are also described, including biases in model validation, heterogeneity in reporting of performance metrics, and lack of sufficient evidence of clinical translation. Challenges related to AI ethics and data governance are also discussed. An outlook is provided for AI in lesion detection on prostate MRI in the coming years, emphasizing current research needs. Future investigations, incorporating large-scale diverse multiinstitutional training and testing datasets, are anticipated to enable the development of more robust AI models for PCa detection on MRI, though prospective clinical trials will ultimately be required to establish benefit of AI in patient management.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) coupled with promising machine learning (ML) techniques well known from computer science is broadly affecting many aspects of various fields including science and technology, industry, and even our day-to-day life. The ML techniques have been developed to analyze high-throughput data with a view to obtaining useful insights, categorizing, predicting, and making evidence-based decisions in novel ways, which will promote the growth of novel applications and fuel the sustainable booming of AI. This paper undertakes a comprehensive survey on the development and application of AI in different aspects of fundamental sciences, including information science, mathematics, medical science, materials science, geoscience, life science, physics, and chemistry. The challenges that each discipline of science meets, and the potentials of AI techniques to handle these challenges, are discussed in detail. Moreover, we shed light on new research trends entailing the integration of AI into each scientific discipline. The aim of this paper is to provide a broad research guideline on fundamental sciences with potential infusion of AI, to help motivate researchers to deeply understand the state-of-the-art applications of AI-based fundamental sciences, and thereby to help promote the continuous development of these fundamental sciences.",

    "abstract": "Neurosurgeons receive extensive and lengthy training to equip themselves with various technical skills, and neurosurgery require a great deal of pre-, intra- and postoperative clinical data collection, decision making, care and recovery. The last decade has seen a significant increase in the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) in neurosurgery. AI can provide a great promise in neurosurgery by complementing neurosurgeons' skills to provide the best possible interventional and noninterventional care for patients by enhancing diagnostic and prognostic outcomes in clinical treatment and help neurosurgeons with decision making during surgical interventions to improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, AI is playing a pivotal role in the production, processing and storage of clinical and experimental data. AI usage in neurosurgery can also reduce the costs associated with surgical care and provide high-quality healthcare to a broader population. Additionally, AI and neurosurgery can build a symbiotic relationship where AI helps to push the boundaries of neurosurgery, and neurosurgery can help AI to develop better and more robust algorithms. This review explores the role of AI in interventional and noninterventional aspects of neurosurgery during pre-, intra- and postoperative care, such as diagnosis, clinical decision making, surgical operation, prognosis, data acquisition, and research within the neurosurgical arena.",

    "abstract": "Cancer victims, particularly those with lung cancer, are more susceptible and at higher danger of COVID-19 and associated consequences as a result of their compromised immune systems, which makes them particularly sensitive. Because of a variety of circumstances, cancer patients' diagnosis, treatment, and aftercare are very complicated and time-consuming during an epidemic. In such circumstances, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms (ML) offer the capacity to boost cancer sufferer diagnosis, therapy, and care via the use of cutting technologies. For example, using clinical and imaging data combined with machine learning methods, the researchers may be able to distinguish among lung alterations induced by corona virus and those produced by immunotherapy and radiation. During this epidemic, artificial intelligence (AI) may be utilized to guarantee that the appropriate individuals are recruited in cancer clinical trials more quickly and effectively than in the past, which was done in a conventional and complicated manner. In order to better care for cancer patients and find novel and more effective therapies, It is critical that we move beyond traditional research methods and use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to update our research (ML). Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being utilised to help with several aspects of the COVID-19 epidemic, such as epidemiology, molecular research and medication development, medical diagnosis and treatment, and socioeconomics. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients is also being investigated. The combination of artificial intelligence and machine learning in COVID-19 may help to identify positive patients more quickly. In order to understand the dynamics of an epidemic that is relevant to artificial intelligence, when used in different patient groups, AI-based algorithms can quickly detect CT scans with COVID-19 linked pneumonia, as well as discriminate non-COVID connected pneumonia with high specificity and accuracy. It is possible to utilize the existing difficulties and future views presented in this study to guide an optimal implementation of AI and machine learning technologies in an epidemic.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease that was first found in Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of November 10, 2020, more than fifty million cases have been confirmed, and more than one million deaths have been reported globally. This situation has created a serious challenge for all countries to institute a variety of control measures to track and slow down the spread of the virus and prevent the increasing number of deaths. In recent years, there has been an ongoing interest in using Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) in healthcare to create new treatments and detecting diseases. The objective of this study is to analyze the application and the impact of A.I. on the breakout of COVID-19 and discuss the contribution of A.I. to the fight against the pandemic based on the most recent applications used in the United Arab Emirates, including Dubai Police Movement Restriction Monitoring System, Taxis Preventive Measures Compliance System, Mobile App \"Wai-Eye,\" Smart Helmets, Virtual Doctor, and The Department of Health - Abu Dhabi (DoH) Remote Healthcare App. The method used in this study is based on a meta-analysis of recent COVID-19 studies from various databases such as ScienceDirect, Sage Journals, SpringerLink, ResearchGate, Emerald Open Research, and IEEE Xplore. The COVID-19 data was based on Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE). Results showed that A.I. applications provided the necessary prevention of the spread of COVID-19, assisted in monitoring restrictions and preventive measures violations, and provided remote healthcare, which directly impacted the number of hospital visits amidst the lockdown. The study concluded that A.I. has proven to be effective in supporting governments in fighting the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study is to develop artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm based on a deep learning model to predict mortality using abbreviate injury score (AIS). The performance of the conventional anatomic injury severity score (ISS) system in predicting in-hospital mortality is still limited. AIS data of 42,933 patients registered in the Korean trauma data bank from four Korean regional trauma centers were enrolled. After excluding patients who were younger than 19\u00a0years old and those who died within six hours from arrival, we included 37,762 patients, of which 36,493 (96.6%) survived and 1269 (3.4%) deceased. To enhance the AI model performance, we reduced the AIS codes to 46 input values by organizing them according to the organ location (Region-46). The total AIS and six categories of the anatomic region in the ISS system (Region-6) were used to compare the input features. The AI models were compared with the conventional ISS and new ISS (NISS) systems. We evaluated the performance pertaining to the 12 combinations of the features and models. The highest accuracy (85.05%) corresponded to Region-46 with DNN, followed by that of Region-6 with DNN (83.62%), AIS with DNN (81.27%), ISS-16 (80.50%), NISS-16 (79.18%), NISS-25 (77.09%), and ISS-25 (70.82%). The highest AUROC (0.9084) corresponded to Region-46 with DNN, followed by that of Region-6 with DNN (0.9013), AIS with DNN (0.8819), ISS (0.8709), and NISS (0.8681). The proposed deep learning scheme with feature combination exhibited high accuracy metrics such as the balanced accuracy and AUROC than the conventional ISS and NISS systems. We expect that our trial would be a cornerstone of more complex combination model.",

    "abstract": "Software for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers offer general functionality of instrument control and data processing; these applications are often developed with non-scripting languages. NMR users need to flexibly integrate rapidly developing NMR applications with emerging technologies. Scripting systems offer open environments for NMR users to write custom programs. However, existing scripting systems have limited capabilities for both extending the functionality of NMR software's non-script main program and using advanced native script libraries to support specialized application domains (e.g., biomacromolecules and metabolomics). Therefore, it is essential to design a novel scripting system to address both of these needs.\nHere, a novel NMR scripting system named SpinSPJ is proposed. It works as a plug-in in the Java based NMR spectrometer software SpinStudioJ. In the scripting system, both Java based NMR methods and original CPython based libraries are supported. A module has been developed as a bridge to integrate the runtime environments of Java and CPython. The module works as an extension in the CPython environment and interacts with Java via the Java Native Interface. Leveraging this bridge, Java based instrument control and data processing methods of SpinStudioJ can be called with the CPython style. Compared with traditional scripting systems, SpinSPJ better supports both extending the non-script main program and implementing advanced NMR applications with a rich variety of script libraries. NMR researchers can easily call functions of instrument control and data processing as well as developing complex functionality (such as multivariate statistical analysis, deep learning, etc.) with CPython native libraries.\nSpinSPJ offers a user-friendly environment to implement custom functionality leveraging its powerful basic NMR and rich CPython libraries. NMR applications with emerging technologies can be easily integrated. The scripting system is free of charge and can be downloaded by visiting http://www.spinstudioj.net/spinspj .",

    "abstract": "Cancer survivors often experience disorders from the depressive spectrum that remain largely unrecognized and overlooked. Even though screening for depression is recognized as essential, several barriers prevent its successful implementation. It is possible that better screening options can be developed. New possibilities have been opening up with advances in artificial intelligence and increasing knowledge on the connection of observable cues and psychological states.\nThe aim of this scoping meta-review was to identify observable features of depression that can be intercepted using artificial intelligence in order to provide a stepping stone toward better recognition of depression among cancer survivors.\nWe followed a methodological framework for scoping reviews. We searched SCOPUS and Web of Science for relevant papers on the topic, and data were extracted from the papers that met inclusion criteria. We used thematic analysis within 3 predefined categories of depression cues (ie, language, speech, and facial expression cues) to analyze the papers.\nThe search yielded 1023 papers, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of their findings resulted in several well-supported cues of depression in language, speech, and facial expression domains, which provides a comprehensive list of observable features that are potentially suited to be intercepted by artificial intelligence for early detection of depression.\nThis review provides a synthesis of behavioral features of depression while translating this knowledge into the context of artificial intelligence-supported screening for depression in cancer survivors.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a new technical discipline that uses computer technology to research and develop the theory, method, technique, and application system for the simulation, extension, and expansion of human intelligence. With the assistance of new AI technology, the traditional medical environment has changed a lot. For example, a patient's diagnosis based on radiological, pathological, endoscopic, ultrasonographic, and biochemical examinations has been effectively promoted with a higher accuracy and a lower human workload. The medical treatments during the perioperative period, including the preoperative preparation, surgical period, and postoperative recovery period, have been significantly enhanced with better surgical effects. In addition, AI technology has also played a crucial role in medical drug production, medical management, and medical education, taking them into a new direction. The purpose of this review is to introduce the application of AI in medicine and to provide an outlook of future trends.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth and decreasing cost of Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made it possible to conduct routine large panel genomic sequencing in many disease settings, especially in the oncology domain. Furthermore, it is now known that optimal disease management of patients depends on individualized cancer treatment guided by comprehensive molecular testing. However, translating results from molecular sequencing reports into actionable clinical insights remains a challenge to most clinicians. In this review, we discuss about some representative systems that leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to facilitate some processes of clinicians' decision making based upon molecular data, focusing on their application in precision oncology. Some limitations and pitfalls of the current application of AI in clinical decision making are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Global aging is becoming more and more serious, and the nursing problems of the elderly will become very serious in the future. The article designs a control system with ATmega128 as the main controller based on the function of the multifunctional nursing robot. The article uses a convolutional neural network structure to estimate the position of 3D human joints. The article maps the joint coordinates of the colour map to the depth map based on the two camera parameters. At the same time, 15 joint heat maps are constructed with the joint depth map coordinates as the centre, and the joint heat map and the depth map are bound to the second-level neural network. The prediction of the position of the user's armpit is further completed by image processing technology. We compare this method with other attitude prediction methods to verify the advantages of this research method. The research background of this article is carried out in the context of global aging in the 21st century.",

    "abstract": "This article uses a multimodal smart music online teaching method combined with artificial intelligence to address the problem of smart music online teaching and to compensate for the shortcomings of the single modal classification method that only uses audio features for smart music online teaching. The selection of music intelligence models and classification models, as well as the analysis and processing of music characteristics, is the subjects of this article. It mainly studies how to use lyrics and how to combine audio and lyrics to intelligently classify music and teach multimodal and monomodal smart music online. In the online teaching of smart music based on lyrics, on the basis of the traditional wireless network node feature selection method, three parameters of frequency, concentration, and dispersion are introduced to adjust the statistical value of wireless network nodes, and an improved wireless network is proposed. After feature selection, the TFIDF method is used to calculate the weights, and then artificial intelligence is used to perform secondary dimensionality reduction on the lyrics. Experimental data shows that in the process of intelligently classifying lyrics, the accuracy of the traditional wireless network node feature selection method is 58.20%, and the accuracy of the improved wireless network node feature selection method is 67.21%, combined with artificial intelligence and improved wireless, the accuracy of the network node feature selection method is 69.68%. It can be seen that the third method has higher accuracy and lower dimensionality. In the online teaching of multimodal smart music based on audio and lyrics, this article improves the traditional fusion method for the problem of multimodal fusion and compares various fusion methods through experiments. The experimental results show that the improved classification effect of the fusion method is the best, reaching 84.43%, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the method.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides an in-depth analysis and research on piano timbre teaching in the context of artificial intelligence interaction, a bold vision of piano teaching, proposes a feasible solution in terms of teaching modules in intelligent piano teaching for senior teachers, and proposes an implementation path for the integration of intelligent piano and piano teaching from the four main blocks of piano teaching. Based on the multiplicative harmonic model of monophonic signal, combined with the variability of timbre characteristics, an audio synthesis model with editable timbre is proposed, and the experimental results show that editing the timbre parameters in the model can realize timbre modification, and the synthesized timbre conforms to the piano timbre characteristics. Based on the timbre analysis and the timbre synthesis model, a piano timbre library generation system is designed. The detailed design of the software modules such as audio file reading and writing, audio information analysis, timbre parameter acquisition, timbre synthesis, and simulated performance is given. The system can generate piano timbre libraries of different qualities flexibly and meet the requirements of timbre realism. The teaching experiment designed for teaching practice from solo teaching, and the practice target is first-year undergraduate students in the university, and the practice period is six weeks, and finally, the feasibility of intelligent piano teaching application is analysed by combining the experimental results. Through the teaching objectives, teaching content, and teaching methods, teaching environment reflects intelligent piano teaching to make up for the limitations of traditional piano teaching. Analyse the development trend of intelligent piano teaching in the context of artificial intelligence interaction, and explore the value of intelligent piano teaching.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to develop models to detect aortic stenosis (AS) from chest radiographs-one of the most basic imaging tests-with artificial intelligence.\nWe used 10\u200a433 retrospectively collected digital chest radiographs from 5638 patients to train, validate, and test three deep learning models. Chest radiographs were collected from patients who had also undergone echocardiography at a single institution between July 2016 and May 2019. These were labelled from the corresponding echocardiography assessments as AS-positive or AS-negative. The radiographs were separated on a patient basis into training [8327 images from 4512 patients, mean age 65\u2009\u00b1\u2009 (standard deviation) 15\u2009years], validation (1041 images from 563 patients, mean age 65\u2009\u00b1\u200914\u2009years), and test (1065 images from 563 patients, mean age 65\u2009\u00b1\u200914\u2009years) datasets. The soft voting-based ensemble of the three developed models had the best overall performance for predicting AS with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.77-0.88), 0.78 (0.67-0.86), 0.71 (0.68-0.73), 0.71 (0.68-0.74), 0.18 (0.14-0.23), and 0.97 (0.96-0.98), respectively, in the validation dataset and 0.83 (0.78-0.88), 0.83 (0.74-0.90), 0.69 (0.66-0.72), 0.71 (0.68-0.73), 0.23 (0.19-0.28), and 0.97 (0.96-0.98), respectively, in the test dataset.\nDeep learning models using chest radiographs have the potential to differentiate between radiographs of patients with and without AS.\nWe created artificial intelligence (AI) models using deep learning to identify aortic stenosis (AS) from chest radiographs. Three AI models were developed and evaluated with 10\u200a433 retrospectively collected radiographs and labelled from echocardiography reports. The ensemble AI model could detect AS in a test dataset with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.78-0.88). Since chest radiography is a cost-effective and widely available imaging test, our model can provide an additive resource for the detection of AS.",

    "abstract": "Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) in Chagas disease (ChD) is relatively common and its treatment using low-cost drugs can improve symptoms and reduce mortality. Recently, an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled ECG algorithm showed excellent accuracy to detect LVSD in a general population, but its accuracy in ChD has not been tested.\nTo analyze the ability of AI to recognize LVSD in patients with ChD, defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction determined by the Echocardiogram \u2264 40%.\nThis is a cross-sectional study of ECG obtained from a large cohort of patients with ChD named S\u00e3o Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical Medicine Research Center (SaMi-Trop) Study. The digital ECGs of the participants were submitted to the analysis of the trained machine to detect LVSD. The diagnostic performance of the AI-enabled ECG to detect LVSD was tested using an echocardiogram as the gold standard to detect LVSD, defined as an ejection fraction <40%. The model was enriched with NT-proBNP plasma levels, male sex, and QRS \u2265 120ms. Among the 1,304 participants of this study, 67% were women, median age of 60; there were 93 (7.1%) individuals with LVSD. Most patients had major ECG abnormalities (59.5%). The AI algorithm identified LVSD among ChD patients with an odds ratio of 63.3 (95% CI 32.3-128.9), a sensitivity of 73%, a specificity of 83%, an overall accuracy of 83%, and a negative predictive value of 97%; the AUC was 0.839. The model adjusted for the male sex and QRS \u2265 120ms improved the AUC to 0.859. The model adjusted for the male sex and elevated NT-proBNP had a higher accuracy of 0.89 and an AUC of 0.874.\nThe AI analysis of the ECG of Chagas disease patients can be transformed into a powerful tool for the recognition of LVSD.",

    "abstract": "In digital medicine, patient data typically record health events over time (eg, through electronic health records, wearables, or other sensing technologies) and thus form unique patient trajectories. Patient trajectories are highly predictive of the future course of diseases and therefore facilitate effective care. However, digital medicine often uses only limited patient data, consisting of health events from only a single or small number of time points while ignoring additional information encoded in patient trajectories. To analyze such rich longitudinal data, new artificial intelligence (AI) solutions are needed. In this paper, we provide an overview of the recent efforts to develop trajectory-aware AI solutions and provide suggestions for future directions. Specifically, we examine the implications for developing disease models from patient trajectories along the typical workflow in AI: problem definition, data processing, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation. We conclude with a discussion of how such AI solutions will allow the field to build robust models for personalized risk scoring, subtyping, and disease pathway discovery.",

    "abstract": "The health sector is an underutilized source of actionable health intelligence for responding to threats across the \"cyber-bionexus,\" defined as the convergence of threats from the biological and cybersecurity domains to produce harms with widespread societal consequences. The escalation of concerns about such threats-related to misinformation and disinformation; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear events; cyberattacks; natural disease outbreaks; and disasters of various kinds-places health system concerns squarely at the forefront of national critical systems and broader security imperatives. Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the dearth of systems available for generating real-time intelligence in relation to critical functions of health sector operations amidst an unfolding crisis. Drawing on principles from the field of cyberthreat intelligence, and building on existing scholarship in health security intelligence, we propose a model for applying health system indicators of compromise for cyberbio events. We further discuss the relevance of this approach within the broader landscape of the cyber-bionexus to signal new pathways for research, practice, and policy engagement.",

    "abstract": "The clinical deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medical imaging is perhaps the greatest challenge facing radiology in the next decade. One of the main obstacles to the incorporation of automated AI-based decision-making tools in medicine is the failure of models to generalize when deployed across institutions with heterogeneous populations and imaging protocols. The most well-understood pitfall in developing these AI models is overfitting, which has, in part, been overcome by optimizing training protocols. However, overfitting is not the only obstacle to the success and generalizability of AI. Underspecification is also a serious impediment that requires conceptual understanding and correction. It is well known that a single AI pipeline, with prescribed training and testing sets, can produce several models with various levels of generalizability. Underspecification defines the inability of the pipeline to identify whether these models have embedded the structure of the underlying system by using a test set independent of, but distributed identically, to the training set. An underspecified pipeline is unable to assess the degree to which the models will be generalizable. Stress testing is a known tool in AI that can limit underspecification and, importantly, assure broad generalizability of AI models. However, the application of stress tests is new in radiologic applications. This report describes the concept of underspecification from a radiologist perspective, discusses stress testing as a specific strategy to overcome underspecification, and explains how stress tests could be designed in radiology-by modifying medical images or stratifying testing datasets. In the upcoming years, stress tests should become in radiology the standard that crash tests have become in the automotive industry. ",

    "abstract": "To investigate how an artificial intelligence (AI) system performs at digital mammography (DM) from a screening population with ground truth defined by digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and whether AI could detect breast cancers at DM that had originally only been detected at DBT.\nIn this secondary analysis of data from a prospective study, DM examinations from 14\u2009768 women (mean age, 57 years), examined with both DM and DBT with independent double reading in the Malm\u04e7 Breast Tomosynthesis Screening Trial (MBTST) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01091545; data collection, 2010-2015), were analyzed with an AI system. Of 136 screening-detected cancers, 95 cancers were detected at DM and 41 cancers were detected only at DBT. The system identifies suspicious areas in the image, scored 1-100, and provides a risk score of 1 to 10 for the whole examination. A cancer was defined as AI detected if the cancer lesion was correctly localized and scored at least 62 (threshold determined by the AI system developers), therefore resulting in the highest examination risk score of 10. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, and detection performance was analyzed with receiver operating characteristics.\nThe highest examination risk score was assigned to 10% (1493 of 14\u2009786) of the examinations. With 90.8% specificity, the AI system detected 75% (71 of 95) of the DM-detected cancers and 44% (18 of 41) of cancers at DM that had originally been detected only at DBT. The majority were invasive cancers (17 of 18).\nAlmost half of the additional DBT-only screening-detected cancers in the MBTST were detected at DM with AI. AI did not reach double reading performance; however, if combined with double reading, AI has the potential to achieve a substantial portion of the benefit of DBT screening.",

    "abstract": "It has been said that COVID-19 is a generational challenge in many ways. But, at the same time, it becomes a catalyst for collective action, innovation, and discovery. Realizing the full potential of artificial intelligence (AI) for structure determination of unknown proteins and drug discovery are some of these innovations. Potential applications of AI include predicting the structure of the infectious proteins, identifying drugs that may be effective in targeting these proteins, and proposing new chemical compounds for further testing as potential drugs. AI and machine learning (ML) allow for rapid drug development including repurposing existing drugs. Algorithms were used to search for novel or approved antiviral drugs capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. This paper presents a survey of AI and ML methods being used in various biochemistry of SARS-CoV-2, from structure to drug development, in the fight against the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. It is envisioned that this study will provide AI/ML researchers and the wider community an overview of the current status of AI applications particularly in structural biology, drug repurposing, and development, and motivate researchers in harnessing AI potentials in the fight against COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The soft robotics community is currently wondering what the future of soft robotics is. Therefore, it is very important to identify the directions in which the community should focus its efforts to consolidate its impact. The identification of convincing applications is a priority, especially to demonstrate that some achievements already represent an attractive alternative to current technological approaches in specific scenarios. However, most of the added value of soft robotics has been only theoretically grasped. Embodied Intelligence, being of these theoretical principles, represents an interesting approach to fully exploit soft robotic's potential, but a pragmatic application of this theory still remains difficult and very limited. A different design approach could be beneficial, i.e., the integration of a certain degree of continuous adaptability in the hardware functionalities of the robot, namely, a \"flexible\" design enabled by hardware components able to fulfill multiple functionalities. In this paper this concept of flexible design is introduced along with its main technological and theoretical basic elements. The potential of the approach is demonstrated through a biological comparison and the feasibility is supported by practical examples with state-of-the-art technologies.",

    "abstract": "With the continuous improvement of economic level and the continuous development of science and technology in China, information technology has begun to integrate into all walks of life. Medical units have begun to change from the traditional medical system to the intelligent system, and the processing of online case information has become an important component of medical informationization. To improve the efficiency of dealing with online case information, this study proposes to establish a fully connected neural network model to deal with online cases. Using jieba word segmentation tool and data preprocessing technology, the data of electronic medical records are sorted out, and the data are quantified using Word2Vec and other tools, and the data on electronic medical records are converted into one-hot binary variables. The quantified data are trained into a fully connected neural model, and the accuracy rate is about 88%. It is compared with naive Bayes and decision tree classification methods, and then a comparative experiment is carried out by solving e-health services in different ways. The results show that the fully connected neural network model has the best classification effect: the highest accuracy rate is about 93.7%, the highest precision rate is about 94.0%, the highest recall rate is about 95.3%, and the highest F1 score is about 94.6%. However, using artificial intelligence technology to solve electronic health services has great advantages, among which efficiency, assistance, and service satisfaction are all higher than 90%, which provides favorable technical support for electronic health services.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to design a set of the visual artificial intelligence system based on medical information mining for hospital emergency care management. A visual artificial intelligence emergency first aid nursing management system is designed by analyzing the needs of the emergency first aid nursing management system. The results show that system personnel allocation, comparative management, record management, query management analysis, basic setup analysis, nursing management basis, and nonfunctional requirements all need to be optimized for the emergency first aid management system. In this study, the comparative management module, log management module, and the query management module are designed, and the emergency first aid management system of different APP terminal functions in different modules is described in detail. The nursing document query business is tested, and the corresponding time of query of nursing assessment sheet, nurse shift record, nurse record, and physical sign observation sheet is 375.50\u2009ms, 351.48\u2009ms, 336.36\u2009ms, and 245.57\u2009ms, respectively. It shows that the visual artificial intelligence emergency nursing management system based on medical information mining can provide convenience for clinical work to a large extent and has potential application value in hospital emergency nursing work.",

    "abstract": "This research was to explore the accuracy of ultrasonic diagnosis based on artificial intelligence algorithm in the diagnosis of pregnancy complicated with brain tumors. In this study, 18 patients with pregnancy complicated with brain tumor confirmed by pathology were selected as the research object. Ultrasound contrast based on artificial bee colony algorithm was performed and diagnosed by experienced clinicians. Ultrasonic image will be reconstructed by artificial bee colony algorithm to improve its image display ability. The pathological diagnosis will be handed over to the physiological pathology laboratory of the hospital for diagnosis. The doctor's ultrasonic diagnosis results were compared with the pathological diagnosis stage results of patients, and the results were analyzed by statistical analysis to evaluate its diagnostic value. The comparison results showed that the number and classification of benign tumors were the same, while in malignant tumors, the number diagnosis was the same, but there was one patient with diagnostic error in classification. One case of mixed glial neuron tumor was diagnosed as glial neuron tumor, and the diagnostic accuracy was 94.44% and the ",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence companies are different from traditional labor-intensive and capital-intensive companies in that their core competitiveness lies in technology, knowledge, and manpower. Enterprises show the characteristics of a high proportion of intangible assets, strong profitability, and rapid growth. At the same time, there are also the characteristics of high risk and high uncertainty. In addition to the existing value brought by existing profitability, corporate value should also consider the potential value brought by potential profitability. Enterprise value is affected by many factors such as profitability, growth ability, innovation ability, and external environment. Traditional valuation techniques are often utilised to value artificial intelligence businesses in the present market. Traditional valuation methods ignore the dynamics and uncertainties of artificial intelligence enterprise value evaluation, make static and single predictions of future earnings, ignore the value of enterprise management flexibility, and are unable to assess the intrinsic value of artificial intelligence businesses. Based on the projection pursuit method, this paper constructs a modern high-quality development enterprise high-quality development evaluation model, uses real-code accelerated genetic algorithm to optimize the projection objective function, and calculates the best projection direction vector and projection value. The collected sample data can be imported into the evaluation model to calculate the comprehensive evaluation value of the high-quality development of modern high-quality development enterprises and the weights of various indicators included. By comparing the size of the comprehensive evaluation value, each sample can be calculated Evaluation of the level of high-quality development. The results show that the high-quality development level of China's overall economy is on the rise, but the level of development is still low, and there is a large gap between the development level of the eastern region and the central and western regions. Using the systematic generalized moment estimation method, empirically, we analyse the impact of artificial intelligence on the high-quality economic development. The results show that artificial intelligence at the national level and in the central and western regions will significantly promote high-quality economic development, while artificial intelligence in the eastern region has a significant inhibitory effect on high-quality economic development.",

    "abstract": "Scientific research consistently demonstrates that diseases may be delayed, treated, or even prevented and, thereby, health may be maintained with health-promoting functional food ingredients (FFIs). Consumers are increasingly demanding sound information about food, nutrition, nutrients, and their associated health benefits. Consequently, a nutrition industry is being formed around natural foods and FFIs, the economic growth of which is increasingly driven by consumer decisions. Information technology, in particular artificial intelligence (AI), is primed to vastly expand the pool of characterised and annotated FFIs available to consumers, by systematically discovering and characterising natural, efficacious, and safe bioactive ingredients (bioactives) that address specific health needs. However, FFI-producing companies are lagging in adopting AI technology for their ingredient development pipelines for several reasons, resulting in a lack of efficient means for large-scale and high-throughput molecular and functional ingredient characterisation. The arrival of the AI-led technological revolution allows for the comprehensive characterisation and understanding of the universe of FFI molecules, enabling the mining of the food and natural product space in an unprecedented manner. In turn, this expansion of bioactives dramatically increases the repertoire of FFIs available to the consumer, ultimately resulting in bioactives being specifically developed to target unmet health needs.",

    "abstract": "The concept of cognitive reserve -CR- postulates two forms that prevent cognitive impairment: neural reserve and neural compensation. Both have been primarily linked to the protective role played by genetic factors, educational level, occupation or socioeconomic status. Though it is true that it has been related to executive functions, so far very little attention has been paid to its predictive capacity with other variables more related to social cognition and psychosocial adaptation. Considering socially vulnerable contexts with reduced cultural capital and educational levels, the neural reserve function would be the most relevant and best predictor of aspects related to social cognition and executive functions. We suggest that variables such as fluid and crystallized intelligence influence social cognition and executive functions. This study included a sample of 27 participants over 60 years old from varied contexts of social vulnerability. The procedure included data collection using various cognitive measures. Results show that elderly people with high intelligence-mainly fluid intelligence-have better executive functions, emotional recognition and theory of mind. These results focus on cognitive reserve and its importance because they show that elderly people in vulnerable contexts who strengthen these aspects protect themselves against the deterioration of cognitive skills. This study is the first preliminary research to present a relationship between cognitive reserve and social cognition factors in elderly subjects. Fluid intelligence functions as a highly related factor to protect the performance of executive functions, along with other social-cognitive factors relevant to facilitating the conditions of social adaptation.",

    "abstract": "At present, online travel agency (OTA) service failure events emerge continually, which makes the OTA service operation mode face new challenges. This study uses the situational experiment method to explore the effects of OTA employees' emotional intelligence and emotional labor (surface behavior and deep behavior) on the effect of service recovery. The results show that the emotional intelligence of OTA employees has a positive impact on the surface behavior and deep behavior; the emotional intelligence and deep behavior of employees have a significant positive impact on service recovery satisfaction, but the positive impact of employees' surface behavior on service recovery satisfaction is not statistically significant; finally, service recovery satisfaction has a positive impact on customer loyalty. This study helps to better explain the mechanism of OTA service recovery effect and provides a theoretical reference for improving the service recovery effect of OTA.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare aims to learn patterns in large multimodal datasets within and across individuals. These patterns may either improve understanding of current clinical status or predict a future outcome. AI holds the potential to revolutionize geriatric mental health care and research by supporting diagnosis, treatment, and clinical decision-making. However, much of this momentum is driven by data and computer scientists and engineers and runs the risk of being disconnected from pragmatic issues in clinical practice. This interprofessional perspective bridges the experiences of clinical scientists and data science. We provide a brief overview of AI with the main focus on possible applications and challenges of using AI-based approaches for research and clinical care in geriatric mental health. We suggest future AI applications in geriatric mental health consider pragmatic considerations of clinical practice, methodological differences between data and clinical science, and address issues of ethics, privacy, and trust.",

    "abstract": "In order to evaluate the postoperative nursing effect of artificial intelligence robot-assisted thoracic surgery, this study proposed the Da Vinci robot-assisted pulmonary lobotomy, from January to December 2014; 42 patients (15 males and 27 females, aged 33-69 years old) underwent lobectomy with the Da Vinci robot system in the chest hospital. A series of postoperative nursing was carried out. The surgical results showed that 42 patients with Da Vinci robot-assisted lobectomy had operation time of 62-225\u2009min and blood loss of 70-300\u2009mL. There was no intraoperative blood transfusion, the intraoperative central rate was maintained at 60-100 times/min, and the blood pressure was maintained at 90-140/60-90\u2009mmHg. No patient was transferred to thoracotomy, and 2 patients were performed robotic wedge resection first, and then, robotic lobectomy was performed after malignant tumor was confirmed by freezing results, with relatively light postoperative pain, no infection, beautiful wound, and smooth recovery and discharge. Robot-assisted lobectomy is a new technique with advantages of less trauma, less pain, faster recovery, and safer and more thorough lymph node dissection.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence plays an important role and has been used by several countries as a health strategy in an attempt to understand, control and find a cure for the disease caused by Coronavirus. These intelligent systems can assist in accelerating the process of developing antivirals for Coronavirus and in predicting new variants of this virus. For this reason, much research on COVID-19 has been developed with the aim of contributing to new discoveries about the Coronavirus. However, there are some epistemological aspects about the use of AI in this pandemic period of Covid-19 that deserve to be discussed and need reflections. In this scenario, this article presents a reflection on the two epistemological aspects faced by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) The epistemological aspect resulting from the use of patient data to fill the knowledge base of intelligent systems; (2) the epistemological problem arising from the dependence of health professionals on the results/diagnoses issued by intelligent systems. In addition, we present some epistemological challenges to be implemented in a pandemic period.",

    "abstract": "Can workflow during IVF be facilitated by artificial intelligence to limit monitoring during ovarian stimulation to a single day and enable level-loading of retrievals?\nThe dataset consisted of 1591 autologous cycles in unique patients with complete data including age, FSH, oestradiol and anti-M\u00fcllerian concentrations, follicle counts and body mass index. Observations during ovarian stimulation included oestradiol concentrations and follicle diameters. An algorithm was designed to identify the single best day for monitoring and predict trigger day options and total number of oocytes retrieved.\nThe mean error to predict the single best day for monitoring was 1.355 days. After identifying the single best day for evaluation, the algorithm identified the trigger date and range of three oocyte retrieval days specified by the earliest and the latest day on which the number of oocytes retrieved was minimally changed with a variance of 0-3 oocytes. Accuracy for prediction of total number of oocytes with baseline testing alone or in combination with data on the day of observation was 0.76 and 0.80, respectively. The sensitivities for estimating the total number and number of mature oocytes based solely on pre-IVF profiles in group I (0-10) were 0.76 and 0.78, and in group II (>10) 0.76 and 0.81, respectively.\nA first-iteration algorithm is described designed to improve workflow, minimize visits and level-load embryology work. This algorithm enables decisions at three interrelated nodal points for IVF workflow management to include monitoring on the single best day, assign trigger days to enable a range of 3 days for level-loading and estimate oocyte number.",

    "abstract": "To prospectively investigate the association between personal activity intelligence (PAI) - a novel metabolic metric which translates heart rate during physical activity into a simple weekly score - and mortality in relatively healthy participants in China whose levels and patterns of physical activity in addition to other lifestyle factors are different from those in high-income countries.\nFrom the population-based China Kadoorie Biobank study, 443,792 healthy adults were recruited between June 2004 and July 2008. Participant's weekly PAI score was estimated and divided into four groups (PAI scores of 0, \u226450, 51-99, or \u2265100). Using Cox proportional hazard analyses, we calculated adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality related to PAI scores.\nDuring a median follow-up of 8.2 (interquartile range, 7.3 to 9.1) years, there were 21,901 deaths, including 9466 CVD deaths. Compared with the inactive group (0 PAI score), a baseline weekly PAI score greater than or equal to 100 was associated with a lower risk of CVD mortality, an AHR of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.94) in men, and an AHR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.92) in women, after adjusting for multiple confounders. Participants with a weekly PAI score greater than or equal to 100 also had a lower risk of all-cause mortality (AHR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89 to 0.97 in men, and AHR, 0.93; 95%, 0.88 to 0.98 in women). Moreover, this subgroup gained 2.7 (95% CI, 2.4 to 3.0) years of life, compared with the inactive cohort.\nAmong relatively healthy Chinese adults, the PAI metric was inversely associated with CVD and all-cause mortality, highlighting the generalizability of the score in different races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic strata.",

    "abstract": "To develop a deep learning-based model for measuring automatic lumbosacral anatomical parameters from lateral lumbar radiographs and compare its performance to that of attending-level radiologists.\nA total of 1791 lateral lumbar radiographs were collected through the PACS system and used to develop the deep learning-based model. Landmarks for the four used parameters, including the lumbosacral lordosis angle (LSLA), lumbosacral angle (LSA), sacral horizontal angle (SHA), and sacral inclination angle (SIA), were identified and automatically labeled by the model. At the same time, the measurement results were obtained through landmarks on the test set compared to manual measurements as the reference standard. Statistical analyses of the Percentage of Correct Key Points (PCK), intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), Pearson correlation coefficient, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and Bland-Altman plots were performed to evaluate the performance of the model.\nThe mean differences between the reference standard and the model for LSLA, LSA, SHA, and SIA, were 0.39\u00b0, 0.09\u00b0, 0.13\u00b0, and 0.12\u00b0, respectively. A strong correlation and consistency between the four parameters were found between the model and reference standard (ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.92-0.98, r\u00a0=\u00a00.92-0.97, MAE\u00a0=\u00a01.35-1.84, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a01.82-2.51), while with statistically significant difference for LSLA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).\nThe presented model revealed clinically equivalent measurements in terms of accuracy, while superior measurements were obtained in terms of cost-effectiveness, reliability, and reproducibility. The model may help clinicians improve their understanding and evaluation of lumbar diseases and LBP from a quantitative perspective in practical work. (ChiCTR2100048250).",

We compared patients with an abnormal vs a normal AI-enhanced electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) screen for LVEF of 35% or below on preoperative electrocardiography. The primary end point was all-cause mortality.\nA total of 20,627 patients were included, of whom 17,125 (83.0%) had a normal AI-ECG screen and 3502 (17.0%) had an abnormal AI-ECG screen.

    "abstract": "Buchwald-Hartwig amination reaction catalyzed by palladium plays an important role in drug synthesis. In the last few years, machine learning-assisted strategies emerged and quickly gained attention. In this article, an importance and relevance-based integrated feature screening method is proposed to effectively filter high-dimensional feature descriptor data. Then, a regularized machine learning boosting tree model, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, is introduced to intelligently predict reaction performance in multidimensional chemistry space. Furthermore, convergence, interpretability, generalization, and the internal association between reaction conditions and yields are excavated, which provides intelligent assistance for the optimal design of coupling reaction system and evaluating the reaction conditions. Compared with recently published results, the proposed method requires fewer feature descriptors, takes less time, and achieves more accurate prediction accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Given the prolongation of the newly emerging COVID-19 pandemic and the significance of caring for the patients by nursing staff, investigating and planning for the different psychological dimensions of this group is of paramount importance. Hence, this study investigated the role of spiritual intelligence in predicting nurses' empathizing with COVID-19 patients.\nThis descriptive-correlation study was conducted in 2021 on nurses caring for COVID-19 patients in three public hospitals. The researchers used two standard questionnaires, including the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) and Spiritual Intelligence (SI), for data collection. The collected data were analyzed in SPSS16 using descriptive statistics and the following: The Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Regression, chi-square test, and Pearson and Spearman correlations.\nThe statistical population consisted of 338 nurses with an average age of 34 and ten years of work experience. There was a significant positive relationship between the empathy scores and spiritual intelligence scores of the nurses caring for COVID-19 patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). It was also concluded from the regression analysis that, spiritual intelligence affect empathy. Mean score of empathy was higher in hospitals where more nursing staff had MSc degrees. There was a significant difference between the empathy scores of the three hospitals (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nThe results indicated that there is a positive relationship between empathy and spiritual intelligence. Therefor improving spiritual intelligence is the appropriate strategy to ameliorate empathy during the COVID19 pandemic. At the same time, study indicated attention to the issue of nurses' mental health. Hence, it was suggested to incorporate these issues in the training programs and national/international decisions.",

    "abstract": "This experimental study was designed using pretest, posttest, follow-up, and control group models to explore the effect of a structured education program on adolescents' psychological resilience and emotional intelligence level.\nThis study was conducted on 70 students at a high school in Turkey. A total of 36 students were assigned to the intervention group and 34 students to the control group. Data were collected using the Adolescent Information Form, Resilience Scale (RS), and Emotional Intelligence Evaluation Scale (EIES). The scales were administered in the intervention group before initializing the education program, who later received a 7-week education program. One month after the administration of the education program, the scales were again administered during follow-up.\nIt was found that the education program improved and increased adolescents' psychological resilience and total emotional intelligence level despite not being significant (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). During the follow-up, adolescents in the intervention group demonstrated an important difference in follow-up scores in the optimism and communication subdimensions of the RS compared to that in the posttest scores, and the intervention group had a higher average total score in the EIES compared to that in students in the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nOur results suggest that the training program has positive effects on improving adolescents' psychological resilience and emotional intelligence levels, especially in the long run, which needs to be developed and applied in different samples.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer type in males in the Western World. MRI has an established role in diagnosis of PCa through guiding biopsies. Due to multistep complex nature of the MRI-guided PCa diagnosis pathway, diagnostic performance has a big variation. Developing artificial intelligence (AI) models using machine learning, particularly deep learning, has an expanding role in radiology. Specifically, for prostate MRI, several AI approaches have been defined in the literature for prostate segmentation, lesion detection and classification with the aim of improving diagnostic performance and interobserver agreement. In this review article, we summarize the use of radiology applications of AI in prostate MRI.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to explore the application value of artificial intelligence algorithm in multimodal MRI image diagnosis of cervical cancer. Based on the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN), an artificial intelligence 3D-CNN algorithm is designed according to the characteristics of cervical cancer. 70 patients with cervical cancer were selected as the experimental group, and 10 healthy people were selected as the reference group. The 3D-CNN algorithm was applied to the diagnosis of clinical cervical cancer multimodal MRI images. The value of the algorithm was comprehensively evaluated by the image quality and diagnostic accuracy. The results showed that compared with the traditional CNN algorithm, the convergence rate of the loss curve of the artificial intelligence 3D-CNN algorithm was accelerated, and the segmentation accuracy of whole-area tumors (WT), core tumor areas (CT), and enhanced tumor areas (ET) was significantly improved. In addition, the clarity of the multimodal MRI image and the recognition performance of the lesion were significantly improved. Under the artificial intelligence 3D-CNN algorithm, the Dice values of WT, ET, and CT regions were 0.78, 0.71, and 0.64, respectively. The sensitivity values were 0.92, 0.91, and 0.88, respectively. The specificity values were 0.93, 0.92, and 0.9\u2009l, respectively. The Hausdorff (Haus) distances were 0.93, 0.92, and 0.90, respectively. The data of various indicators were significantly better than those of the traditional CNN algorithm (",

Their staggering computational cost, however, poses great limitations, which luckily can be lifted to a great extent by exploiting advances in artificial intelligence (AI). Here we introduce the general-purpose, highly transferable artificial intelligence-quantum mechanical method 1 (AIQM1). It approaches the accuracy of the gold-standard coupled cluster QM method with high computational speed of the approximate low-level semiempirical QM methods for the neutral,\u00a0closed-shell species in the ground state. AIQM1 can provide accurate ground-state energies for diverse organic compounds as well as geometries for even challenging systems such as large conjugated compounds (fullerene C",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an iterative process by which information is captured, transformed into knowledge and processed to produce adaptive changes in the environment. AI is a broad concept, involving virtual (computing) and physical (robotics) elements. In this narrative literature review, we focus on the aspects of AI that present major opportunities for developing health care. Within a few years, AI will be part of our daily clinical practice. Although significant advances are being made, the application of AI in musculoskeletal medicine is still in its early stages compared with its implementation in other areas of medicine. AI is increasingly being employed in fields such as musculoskeletal radiology, skeletal trauma, orthopedic surgery, physical and rehabilitation medicine and sports medicine, as well as for \"big data\" and AI in gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy related injuries. Among the limitations of IA are that it analyzes information based on the data it is supplied, which must therefore be well-labeled and that some algorithms such as DL uses more time, data, and computational power than other techniques. Moreover, AI currently does not solve the problem of causality that exists in medicine with observational data; information that physicians interpret within a broad clinical context. AI should therefore be integrated in a prudent and reasonable manner into the workflows of health professionals.",

    "abstract": "Clinical databases, particularly those composed of big data, face growing security challenges. Blockchain, the open, decentralized, distributed public ledger technology powering cryptocurrency, records transactions securely without the need for third-party verification. In the health care setting, decentralized blockchain networks offer a secure interoperable gateway for clinical research and practice data. Here, we discuss recent advances and potential future directions for the application of blockchain and its integration with artificial intelligence (AI) in cardiovascular medicine. We first review the basic underlying concepts of this technology and contextualise it within the spectrum of current, well known applications. We then consider specific applications for cardiovascular medicine and research in areas such as high-throughput gene sequencing, wearable technologies, and clinical trials. We then evaluate current challenges to effective implementation and future directions. We also summarise the health care applications that can be realised by combining decentralized blockchain computing platforms (for data security) and AI computing (for data analytics). By leveraging high-performance computing and AI capable of securely managing large and rapidly expanding medical databases, blockchain incorporation can provide clinically meaningful predictions, help advance research methodology (eg, via robust AI-blockchain decentralized clinical trials), and provide virtual tools in clinical practice (eg, telehealth, sensory-based technologies, wearable medical devices). Integrating AI and blockchain approaches synergistically amplifies the strengths of both technologies to create novel solutions to serve the objective of providing precision cardiovascular medicine.",
