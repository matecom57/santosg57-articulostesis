    "abstract": "The authors examined the relations among intelligence, personality, and creativity. They consider the concept and definition of creativity in conjunction with the qualifications that researchers in the field have suggested. The present authors briefly refer to historiometric studies but focus on psychometric intelligence and its relations to tests of divergent thinking (DT) and ratings of creativity. The authors consider the relation between personality and creativity in the context of Eysenckian 3-factor and 5-factor models of personality and with reference to DT tests and ratings of creativity. The authors also present recommendations for the future study of creativity.",

    "abstract": "Medical science has made revolutionary changes in the past few decades. Contemporaneously, however, healthcare has made incremental changes at best. One area within healthcare that best exemplifies this is the operating room (OR). The growing discrepancy between the revolutionary changes in medicine and the minimal changes in healthcare processes leads to inefficient and ineffective healthcare deliver and one if not the significant contributor to the exponentially increasing costs plaguing healthcare globally. Significant quantities of data and information permeate the healthcare industry, yet the healthcare industry has not maximised this data resource by fully embracing key business management processes or techniques (such as Knowledge Management (KM), data mining, Business Intelligence (BI) or Business Analytics (BA)) to capitalise on realising the full value of this data/information resource to reengineer processes. The Intelligence Continuum (IC), a Mobius strip of sophisticated tools, techniques and process provides a systematic mechanism for healthcare organisations to facilitate superior clinical practice and administrative management. In this paper, the case example of the orthopaedic OR is used to illustrate the power of the IC in effecting more efficient and effective healthcare processes to ensue and thereby enabling healthcare to make evolutionary changes.",

    "abstract": "The world has recently witnessed several large scale natural disasters. These include the Asian tsunami which devastated many of the countries around the rim of the Indian Ocean in December 2004, extensive flooding in many parts of Europe in August 2005, hurricane katrina (September 2005), the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in many regions of Asia and Canada in 2003 and the Pakistan earthquake (towards the end of 2005). Such emergency and disaster situations (E&DS) serve to underscore the utter chaos that ensues in the aftermath of such events, the many casualties and lives lost not to mention the devastation and destruction that is left behind. One recurring theme that is apparent in all these situations is that, irrespective of the warnings of imminent threats, countries have not been prepared and ready to exhibit effective and efficient crisis management. This paper examines the application of the tools, techniques and processes of the knowledge economy to develop a prescriptive model that will support superior decision making in E&DS, thereby enabling effective and efficient crisis management.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel algorithm combining artificial neural networks and swarm intelligence (SI) methods to infer network interactions. The algorithm uses ant colony optimization (ACO) to identify the optimal architecture of a recurrent neural network (RNN), while the weights of the RNN are optimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Our goal is to construct an RNN that mimics the true structure of an unknown network and the time-series data that the network generated. We applied the proposed hybrid SI-RNN algorithm to infer a simulated genetic network. The results indicate that the algorithm has a promising potential to infer complex interactions such as gene regulatory networks from time-series gene expression data.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge management (KM) is rapidly becoming established as a core organizational element within the healthcare industry to assist in the delivery of better patient care. KM is a cyclical process which typically starts with knowledge creation (KC), progresses to knowledge sharing, knowledge accessibility and eventually results in new KC (in the same or a related domain). KC plays a significant role in KM as it creates the necessary \"seeds\" for propagating many more knowledge cycles. This paper addresses the potential of KC in the context of the UK's National Health Service (NHS) breast screening service. KC can be automated to a greater extent by embedding processes within an artificial intelligence (AI) based environment. The UK breast screening service is concerned about non-attendance and this paper discusses issues pertaining to increasing attendance.",

    "abstract": "Recent experimentation has shown that cognitive aptitude measures are predicted by tests of the scope of an individual's attention or capacity in simple working memory tasks and also by the ability to control attention. However, these experiments do not indicate how separate or related the scope and control of attention are. An experiment with 52 children (10 to 11 years old) and 52 college students included measures of the scope and control of attention, as well as verbal and nonverbal aptitude measures. The children showed little evidence of using sophisticated attentional control, but the scope of attention predicted intelligence in that group. In adults, both the scope and control of attention varied among individuals and accounted for considerable individual variance in intelligence. About one third that variance was shared between scope an d control, and the rest was unique to one or the other. Scope and control of attention appear to be related but distinct contributors to intelligence.",

    "abstract": "People integrate the features of perceived events and of action plans, as well as of episodic stimulus-response relations, into event files. We investigated whether the management of event files, and particularly the speed of updating the binding between the task-relevant stimulus feature and the response, correlates with fluid intelligence. Indeed, the performance of participants scoring high on Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices test was less impaired by a mismatch between the stimulus-response relation in the current and the previous trial. This result suggests that high intelligence is accompanied by a higher degree of flexibility in handling event files--that is, by higher efficiency in updating episodic representations.",

    "abstract": "Recent findings (Beilock & Carr, 2005) have demonstrated that only individuals with a high working memory capacity (WMC) \"choke under pressure\" on math problems with high working memory demands. This suggests that performance pressure hinders those who are the most qualified to succeed, because it consumes the WMC they usually rely on to achieve superior performance. This puts into question the use of performance in high-pressure situations as a means of distinguishing individuals with lesser or greater WMC potentials. While addressing several limitations of past research, we offer evidence that such choking (1) occurs only in individuals with high WMC, because of their anxiety-ridden perceptions of high-stakes situations, and (2) is not confined to tasks involving acquired skills and knowledge, but encompasses fluid reasoning abilities or intelligence (Gf). These findings have strong implications for assessments of people's intellectual capacities in academic, clinical, work, and research settings.",

    "abstract": "The roles of age, social intelligence and parent-child communication in moderating the association between digital game playing and direct and indirect aggression were examined in 478 Finnish 10- and 13-year-old schoolchildren based on self-reports. The results confirmed that digital game violence was directly associated with direct aggression, especially at age 10, but only among boys. The moderating role of social intelligence was substantiated among older boys: game violence was associated with indirect aggression among those with high level of social intelligence. Further, as hypothesized, digital game playing was associated with direct aggression especially when parent-child communication was poor, but only among boys. Our findings emphasize the importance of individual and situational factors as moderators of the link between game violence and aggression.",

    "abstract": "Students' beliefs and goals can powerfully influence their learning success. Those who believe intelligence is a fixed entity (entity theorists) tend to emphasize 'performance goals,' leaving them vulnerable to negative feedback and likely to disengage from challenging learning opportunities. In contrast, students who believe intelligence is malleable (incremental theorists) tend to emphasize 'learning goals' and rebound better from occasional failures. Guided by cognitive neuroscience models of top-down, goal-directed behavior, we use event-related potentials (ERPs) to understand how these beliefs influence attention to information associated with successful error correction. Focusing on waveforms associated with conflict detection and error correction in a test of general knowledge, we found evidence indicating that entity theorists oriented differently toward negative performance feedback, as indicated by an enhanced anterior frontal P3 that was also positively correlated with concerns about proving ability relative to others. Yet, following negative feedback, entity theorists demonstrated less sustained memory-related activity (left temporal negativity) to corrective information, suggesting reduced effortful conceptual encoding of this material-a strategic approach that may have contributed to their reduced error correction on a subsequent surprise retest. These results suggest that beliefs can influence learning success through top-down biasing of attention and conceptual processing toward goal-congruent information.",

    "abstract": "Most of the forecasting models of Plasmopara viticola infections are based upon empiric correlations between meteorological/environmental data and pathogen outbreak. These models generally overestimate the risk of infections and induce to treat the vineyard even if it should be not necessary. In rare cases they underrate the risk of infection leaving the pathogen to breakout. Starting from these considerations we have decided to approach the problem from another point of view utilizing Artificial Intelligence techniques for data elaboration and analysis. Meanwhile the same data have been studied with a more classic approach with statistical tools to verify the impact of a large data collection on the standard data analysis methods. A network of RTUs (Remote Terminal Units) distributed all over the Italian national territory transmits 12 environmental parameters every 15 minutes via radio or via GPRS to a centralized Data Base. Other pedologic data is collected directly from the field and sent via Internet to the centralized data base utilizing Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) running a specific software. Data is stored after having been preprocessed, to guarantee the quality of the information. The subsequent analysis has been realized mostly with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Collecting and analizing data in this way will probably bring us to the possibility of preventing Plasmospara viticola infection starting from the environmental conditions in this very complex context. The aim of this work is to forecast the infection avoiding the ineffective use of the plant protection products in agriculture. Applying different analysis models we will try to find the best ANN capable of forecasting with an high level of affordability.",

    "abstract": "In a rapidly changing environment, national institutions in charge of health security can no longer rely only on traditional disease reporting mechanisms that are not designed to recognise emergence of new hazards. Epidemic intelligence provides a conceptual framework within which countries may adapt their public health surveillance system to meet new challenges. Epidemic intelligence (EI) encompasses all activities related to early identification of potential health hazards, their verification, assessment and investigation in order to recommend public health control measures. EI integrates both an indicator-based and an event-based component. 'Indicator-based component' refers to structured data collected through routine surveillance systems. 'Event-based component' refers to unstructured data gathered from sources of intelligence of any nature. All EU member states have long-established disease surveillance systems that provide proper indicator-based surveillance. For most countries, the challenge lies now in developing and structuring the event-based component of EI within national institution in charge of public health surveillance. In May 2006, the European Union member states committed to comply with provisions of the revised International Health Regulations (IHR(2005)) considered relevant to the risk posed by avian and potential human pandemic influenza. This provides for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) with an opportunity to guide member states in developing and/or strengthening their national EI , in addition to the ECDC's task of developing an EI system for the EU.",

    "abstract": "The Syndrome of Irritable Intestine (SII) is a chronic functional dysfunction that it is characterized by abdominal pain and changes of intestinal rhythm without demonstrable organic alteration. It is avery prevelent dysfunction in the developed countries, there being involved in its physiopathology, among other, the psychosocial factors (illness behavior, social situation, stress, vital events, neuroticism, anxiety and somatization). However no study has been carried out on the Rational Intelligence and Experiential Intelligence or Constructive Thought in patient with SII in spite of knowing that the cognitive processes participate in its genesis. On the hypothesis that the patients with SII would have an experiencial intelligence smaller that the fellows controls, 100 cases of SII and 100 controls have been studied, being excluded of both patients groups with intellectual deficit or psychiatric illness in the last year. The cases of SII were distributed in two groups, one of 50 cases that habitually consulted with the doctor and other 50 that didn't make it. All the participants completed specific tests to evaluate all the psychological factors and Rational Intelligence and the Constructive Thought. The results show an alteration of the psychological factors in the SII, expressed by the antecedents of vital events, m even significant of anxiety feature and anxiety and a neuroticism statistically significant. As for Rational Intelligence and Experiential Intelligence in the SII, it was observed that to Rational Intelligence is same in the patients with SII that in the controls. Only in the group of SII that habitually consulted with the doctor a slightly significant decrease of the intellectual coefficient it was observed. As for the Experiential Intelligence a significant decrease of the Constructive Thought was observed in the patients with SII in comparison with the group control. Of their components a decrease of the emotionality exists and of the effectiveness, an increase of the superstitious thought and of the rigidity, being the occult thought and the illusion is the same as in the group control. In synthesis, they are associated factors to suffer SII a bigger neuroticism and an increase of the level of anxiety feature and state, and of the vital stressful events, as well as a decrease of the Constructive Thought. On the contrary they would be associated factors to consult the doctor an increase of the anxiety, a decrease of the Constructive Thought and a decrease of Rational Intelligence. The implications of these discoveries can be physiopathological and therapeutic, since the Experiencial Intelligence is relates with the stress grade auto-generated by the \"normal\" events of the daily life. Questions without answering are if it could be the biological answer to this auto-generated stress an important factor in the pathogenia of the SII or if this stress could be the nexus of union of the SII with the neuroticism and the anxiety. As for the therapy, and since the Experiential Intelligence is amendable, it would be necessary to think about if the modification of the Experiential Intelligence by means of a therapeutic intervention would bear an improvement of the symptoms of the SII.",

Developmental disability ranged from mild to moderate. Partially contrasting with previous studies on normal samples, results found a two-factor solution.

In light of these results, a follow-up study was conducted to assess whether attributes such as empathy, intelligence, subjectivity, or insightfulness influenced ability to fake a PTSD profile on the MMPI-2. 35 subjects from the previous study were divided into two groups, successful fakers and unsuccessful fakers. Analysis indicated no significant differences between groups on the measures of empathy or intelligence. However, a significant difference was found between groups on the Schizophrenia and Cynicism scales and falling just short of significance on the Hypochondriasis scale. These results suggested that individuals able to fake PTSD are more insightful and less subjective, which makes them better at role-playing.",

    "abstract": "The causes underlying the correlation between working memory and fluid intelligence remain unknown. There are some researchers who argue that the answer can be found on the presumed executive component of working memory. However, the available empirical evidence is far from conclusive. The present study tested a sample of 229 participants. Intelligence, working memory, and executive functioning were measured by one analytic reasoning test (TRASI), a dual task combining a primary task of deductive reasoning with a secondary task of counting, and the Tower of Hanoi task, respectively. All the 3 measures were computer administered. The results indicate that the shared variance between executive functioning and working memory do not account for the relationship between intelligence and working memory. Some theoretical implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This work presents the main theories and models formulated with the purpose of offering a global overview on the acquisition of knowledge and skills involved in the initial development of expert competence. Setting from this background, we developed an empirical work whose main purpose is to define those factors in a complex learning situation such as chapter-sized in a knowledge-rich domain. The results obtained in a sample of Master students reveal that the several variables intervening, such as the qualitative organization of knowledge, intellectual ability, motivation, the deliberate use of strategies, and a rich learning environment, contribute in an independent way to provide an explanation for the acquired knowledge.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the role of Perceived Emotional Intelligence (PEI) (measured by the Spanish version of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale) and general self-efficacy as predictors of burnout and engagement dimensions. The unique contribution of PEI dimensions on the burnout and engagement scores is explored, controlling the influence of demographics characteristics, perceived stress and self-efficacy. Data were collected from a sample of 373 Spanish undergraduate students (mean age= 21.87 yr; SD= 5.82 yr) and analyzed using hierarchical regressions. Results indicate the relevance of PEI as an individual resource and support the hypothesis that this construct accounted for non-overlapping variance on academic burnout and engagement above and beyond classic constructs predicting these criterion measures such as perceived stress and general self-efficacy.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between Perceived Emotional Intelligence (PEI) and Life Satisfaction in university teachers. To assess the nature of these relationships and to predict the factors implied on life satisfaction, positive and negative affect, work satisfaction and alexithymia measures were used. 52 university teachers (30 men and 22 women) completed the Spanish version of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale for emotional intelligence (TMMS, Fern\u00e1ndez-Berrocal, Extremera & Ramos, 2004). Alexithymia was measured by the Spanish version of the TAS-20 (Mart\u00ednez-S\u00e1nchez, 1996), and life satisfaction was measured by SWLS (D\u00edaz Morales, 2001). Also, Work Satisfaction Scale was used (JWS, Grajales & Araya, 2001). Our results yield a strong correlation between life satisfaction and TMMS subscales (emotional Clarity and emotional Repair), TAS-20 subscales (difficulty to describe emotions and external oriented thinking), and Work Satisfaction Scale. Further analyses show that the life satisfaction most significant predictors were positive and negative affect and emotional Clarity. These results support the incremental validity of self-report measures, as the TMMS, and the capacity of constructs related to emotional intelligence to explain the differences on life satisfaction independently from personality traits and mood states constructs.",

    "abstract": "We present a theoretical model of attributions and emotions, and the behavioral and psychological consequences of these in the workplace. Expanding on Weiner's (1985) framework, we argue that emotional intelligence plays a moderating role in the attribution-emotion-behavior process. Specifically, the emotional intelligence dimensions of perception, facilitation, and understanding emotion are posited to moderate the relationship between outcome-dependent affect and attribution formation. Further, the emotion management dimension of emotional intelligence is argued to moderate the relationship between attributions and subsequent emotional responses. These emotional responses are then argued to influence behavioral, motivational, and psychological consequences in the workplace.",

    "abstract": "This study found a significant positive relationship between emotional intelligence (MSCEIT) and deep acting (making an effort to feel emotions that are required in interpersonal interactions) in a sample of service workers. Surface acting (faking displayed emotions and hiding personal feelings) was positively associated with emotional awareness. Emotional intelligence did not add to the prediction of variance in emotional labor beyond situational demands, nor did it moderate the relationship between situational demands and emotional labor. Thus, workers' level of emotional intelligence did not appear to influence the nature of the emotional labor that was performed given situational demands. Rather, the key role of emotional intelligence seemed to be as a predictor of the perceived situational demands, which, in turn, predicted the nature of emotional labor that was performed. Workers with higher levels of emotional intelligence were found to be more likely to perceive the need to frequently display emotions as part of their work role and perform deep acting in response to these situational demands.",

    "abstract": "Competencies have been shown to differentiate outstanding managers and leaders from their less effective counterparts. Some of the competencies related to effectiveness reflect cognitive intelligence, but many of them are behavioral manifestations of emotional intelligence. Meanwhile, the performance measures used have often been an approximation of effectiveness. A study of leaders in a multi-national, consulting company shows that the frequency with which they demonstrate a variety of competencies, as seen by others, predicts financial performance in the seven quarters following the competency assessment. This, like other studies only clarify which competencies are necessary for outstanding performance. Borrowing from complexity theory, a tipping point analysis allows examination of how much of the competency is sufficient for outstanding performance. Using the tipping point analysis shows an even greater impact of competencies on the financial performance measures of the leaders in the study. The emotional intelligence competencies constituted most (i.e., 13/14) of the validated competencies predicting financial performance.",

High school students (N = 77) took the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test - Spanish Version (MSCEIT V. 2.0, 2002), a measure of Big Five personality traits (BFQ; Caprara, Barbanelli, & Borgogni , 1993), an General Intelligence test (IGF-r 5; Yuste, 2002), and a social competence inventory (AECS; Moraleda, Gonz\u00e1lez, & Garc\u00eda-Gallo, 1998). Students' academic grades also were obtained from official school records at the end of the school year. As predicted, the MSCEIT was discriminable from well-established measures of personality and intelligence. The test was also moderately related to social competence and predicted students' final grades. Most of the findings remained significant after personality and academic intelligence were statistically controlled. The potential utility of EI in the context of academic institutions is discussed.",

After controlling for IQ and the Big Five personality traits, the ability to understand and manage emotions remained significantly associated with teacher ratings of academic adaptation among boys and peer friendship nominations among girls.

The two studies in this paper investigate the construct validity of trait EI, as operationalized by the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue). In Study 1 (34 ballet students; 5 ballet teachers), we found moderate to high levels of convergence between self and other ratings of trait EI and a positive relationship between trait EI scores and ballet dancing ability ratings. In Study 2 (37 music students), we found a positive relationship between trait EI scores and length of musical training.

    "abstract": "The aim of this work has been to analyse the role of Perceived Emotional Intelligence (PEI) in the use of tobacco and cannabis in 133 psychology undergraduates (114 women and 19 men), all aged between 18 and 27, with a mean age of 21.52 yr. (SD= 5.42). PEI was assessed using an abbreviated version of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS), developed by Salovey, Mayer, Goldman, Turvey and Palfai (1995) and adapted into Spanish by Fern\u00e1ndez-Berrocal, Extremera, and Ramos (2004). The TMMS assesses an individual's ability to perceive, understand and manage emotion. The principal results obtained point to the fact that the students who consume tobacco or cannabis present lower levels of the Repair component of the TMMS and are those who started consuming tobacco or cannabis at an earlier age. On the other hand, Emotional Clarity appears to be related to the occasional consumption of cannabis, in that the students attaining high scores were those who consumed less. The Emotional Attention component of the TMMS is not involved in the consumption of these substances. These preliminary findings indicate the existing relationship between some components of the TMMS and the consumption of tobacco or cannabis. Nevertheless, we need to further investigate the differing implications of each one of the PEI components in the use of these substances.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the different facets of perceived emotional intelligence (EI), alexithymia and how these facets were related to coping and affect regulation, using as indexes social support, perceived stress, depression and affect balance. Participants were 593 introductory psychology students. The results clarified and confirmed that emotional intelligence and alexithymia scales (TMMS-48 and TAS-20) converged in a clarity and regulation of emotion factor, that showed criterion validity with self-reports of mental health, affect balance and social adjustment and simultaneously to an adaptative profile of coping with stress, that mediated and explained how emotional clarity, capacity to identify feelings, ability to express and repair mood and feelings, help to emotional regulation. Attention to emotion and low external oriented thinking did not show criterion validity with mental health or with adaptive coping.",

    "abstract": "As trait emotional intelligence [TEI] is claimed to facilitate adaptation, study 1 (N= 80) investigated whether TEI would be associated with adaptative outcomes such as enhanced self-reported mental and physical health. As these assumptions were supported, study 2 (N= 75) tested the hypothesis of a moderating effect of TEI on the relationship between stress and psychological and somatic health. Incremental validity of TEI over alexithymia and optimism was also examined. We chose academic exams as the stressor and took measures at the beginning of the year and during the examination period. Regression analyses predicting changes in mental/somatic health from baseline to follow-up revealed that TEI significantly moderated the relationship between examination stress and self-reported health. The fact that high EI people appraised the examination situation as less threatening partly explained this effect. Moreover, TEI predicted both mental and somatic symptoms amid stress over and above alexithymia and optimism.",

    "abstract": "This research analysed the influence of Emotional Intelligence (EI) on emotional responses in laboratory context. Specifically, 1) how does EI affect previous mood states? 2) How does persons' emotional reactivity to different mood induction conditions depend on their EI? 3) How does EI help to a better mood recovery? For these purposes, 155 participants (123 women and 32 men) were measured for EI using Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS) one month before the experimental session. The TMMS assesses perceived ability to (a) attend to moods (Attention), (b) discriminate clearly among moods (Clarity), and (c) regulate moods (Repair). The experiment comprised three phases. At time 1 experimenter assessed mood states of the participants before mood induction. At time 2 (mood reactivity phase), participants were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental conditions: amusement, anger, and sadness mood conditions. Subsequently participants were assessed in their mood states. At time 3 (mood recovery phase), following a rest period participants were evaluated in mood states and intrusive thoughts measures. Results indicated that EI, specifically Clarity and Repair, was related to previous mood states, emotional reactivity to mood induction conditions, and emotional recovery. Clarity and Repair play different but complementary roles in processing emotional situations generated in laboratory context. In this sense, EI could join the list of personal and interpersonal factors that contribute to the efficient processing of positive and negative emotions.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence has received an intense amount of attention in leadership circles during the last decade and continuing debate exists concerning the best method for measuring this construct. This study analyzed leader emotional intelligence scores, measured via skill and ability methodologies, against leader job performance. Two hundred twelve employees from three organizations participated in this study. Scores on the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal, a skill-based assessment, were positively, though not significantly, correlated with scores on the MSCEIT, an ability-based assessment of emotional intelligence. Scores on the MSCEIT did not have a significant relationship with job performance in this study, whereas, scores on the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal had a strong link to leader job performance. The four subcomponents of the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal were examined against job performance. Relationship management was a stronger predictor of leader job performance than the other three subcomponents. Social awareness was the single emotional intelligence skill that did not have a significant link to leader job performance. Factor analyses yielded a two-component model of emotional intelligence encompassing personal and social competence, rather than confirmation of a four-part taxonomy.",

Exploratory factor analyses of the initial pool of items resulted in four factors: Empathy, Utilization of Feelings, Handling Relationships, and Self-control. The present study examined the concurrent validity of the EII and the Emotional Intelligence Scale using responses of 234 college students on both inventories. The instruments were administered concurrently to students in their classes from classes randomly selected from sections representing students from all colleges, majors, and undergraduate grade levels. Correlations between the total score of the EII and the Emotional Intelligence Scale were significant. Correlations between each subscale of the EII and the Emotional Intelligence Scale were significant. Correlations calculated across gender were significant. These results indicated that the EII and the Emotional Intelligence scale have concurrent validity across gender and by gender.",

    "abstract": "Consensus scoring occurs when the scoring key for a test is based upon the responses of the norm group. Consensus scoring is an attractive alternative to traditional methods of creating a scoring key for ability tests, especially useful when experts disagree about the correct answers to test items, as they do in the area of emotions and emotion perception. Of the many variations of consensus scoring, mode consensus scoring (the most frequent response in a norm group is given a score of 1, and all other responses a score of 0) and proportion consensus scoring (each respondent's score on an item is equal to the proportion of the norm group who match the respondent's answer) are the most widely used and the most psychometrically promising. This paper demonstrates that mode consensus scoring is biased against smaller sub-groups within the norm group: when sub-groups differ in their modal responses, the size of the sub-groups will influence the average group score. No known scoring option eliminates this bias. In contrast, proportion consensus scoring is not necessarily biased against smaller groups, although bias does occur in some extreme situations. Proportion consensus scoring is therefore the preferred consensus scoring option at this time.",

After the translation and back-translation process, the objectives of this study were: 1) to examine the reliability of the Spanish version of the MSCEIT v.2.0 at the total scale, area, branch and subscale levels; 2) to analyze the correlations between the methods of scoring in the Spanish version of the MSCEIT v.2.0 at the total scale, area, branch and subscale levels; 3) to examine possible gender differences on MSCEIT scores; and 4) to examine the relationship between age and MSCEIT scores. These analyses revealed good reliability and internal consistency for the Spanish version of the MSCEIT; a high level of convergence between scoring methods; and higher scores obtained by women on overall scale and branches scores than scores obtained by men. A positive correlation between the scores on MSCEIT and age was found. Finally, these results are discussed in light of the limitations of the present study, the implications of the use of this new instrument, and the need for future research on emotional intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Emotional Intelligence (EI) has generated a broad interest both in the lay and scientific fields. Since the development of the concept, research on EI is increasing exponentially. Prestigious scientists from different lines of research contribute to this Special Issue on EI, assessing important theoretical and empirical topics on this construct. The first section of the Special Issue comprises manuscripts reviewing current models and approaches to EI, together with theoretical aspects of the concept. One of the most important topics on EI regards the measurement of the concept, the second section of this issue deeply assesses this matter presenting original investigations on the three approaches available for the measurement of EI. Subsequently, the impact of EI on applied fields, specifically on health, education, and organizations is described and supported by scientific papers in the last section of this Special Issue.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, the relationship between performance on temporal and pitch discrimination and psychometric intelligence was investigated in a sample of 164 participants by means of an experimental dissociation paradigm. Performance on both temporal and pitch discrimination was substantially related to psychometric intelligence (r=.43 and r =.39). Regression analysis and structural equation modeling suggested that both psychophysical domains can be considered as valid predictors of psychometric intelligence. Both predictor variables contributed substantial portions of both shared and unique variance to the prediction of individual differences in psychometric intelligence. Thus, the present study yielded further evidence for a functional relationship between psychometric intelligence and temporal as well as pitch discrimination acuity. Eventually, findings are consistent with the notion that temporal discrimination - in addition to general aspects of sensory discrimination shared with pitch discrimination reflects specific intelligence-related aspects of neural information processing.",

    "abstract": "Multi-herb prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) often include special herb-pairs for mutual enhancement, assistance, and restraint. These TCM herb-pairs have been assembled and interpreted based on traditionally defined herbal properties (TCM-HPs) without knowledge of mechanism of their assumed synergy. While these mechanisms are yet to be determined, properties of TCM herb-pairs can be investigated to determine if they exhibit features consistent with their claimed unique synergistic combinations. We analyzed distribution patterns of TCM-HPs of TCM herb-pairs to detect signs indicative of possible synergy and used artificial intelligence (AI) methods to examine whether combination of their TCM-HPs are distinguishable from those of non-TCM herb-pairs assembled by random combinations and by modification of known TCM herb-pairs. Patterns of the majority of 394 known TCM herb-pairs were found to exhibit signs of herb-pair correlation. Three AI systems, trained and tested by using 394 TCM herb-pairs and 2470 non-TCM herb-pairs, correctly classified 72.1-87.9% of TCM herb-pairs and 91.6-97.6% of the non-TCM herb-pairs. The best AI system predicted 96.3% of the 27 known non-TCM herb-pairs and 99.7% of the other 1,065,100 possible herb-pairs as non-TCM herb-pairs. Our studies suggest that TCM-HPs of known TCM herb-pairs contain features distinguishable from those of non-TCM herb-pairs consistent with their claimed synergistic or modulating combinations.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the relationship between motor coordination and intelligence level in adolescents. The sample was comprised of 550 adolescents from Slovenia, aged 13.1 years (SD = 0.87), who attended elementary schools. For assessment of motor coordination a battery of eight tests were used. Assessment of intelligence was carried out with test TN-20. Participants were divided into below average and above average intelligence groups based on their mean scores. ANOVA was used to determine the differences in motor coordination between above and below average intelligence groups. The most important finding was that adolescents of average intelligence performed motor coordination tasks more efficiently than did adolescents of below average intelligence. The difference is significant (p < .05) on seven of eight coordination tests. Our assumption that adolescents with higher level of intelligence would be more efficient in performing coordination tasks was confirmed.",

    "abstract": "Educational research places emphasis on the fact that different cultures have different self-construals. These construals can influence cognitive, emotional, and motivational processes in individuals. Great importance is attached to individuals' implicit conceptions of the nature of their intelligence (incremental or entity) and self-esteem. In general, both representation of intelligence and self-esteem seem to play an important role in scholastic performance in terms of both a predispostion to learning and the results actually achieved. The aim of this research is to determine the relationship between variables such as school, and socioeconomic level and gender in Italian and Portuguese students. A questionnaire was administered to 1,540 high school and university students assessing socioeconomic level and school performance, the Personal Conceptions of Intelligence Test (Faira & Fontaine, 1997), and the Self-Esteem Test (Rosenberg, 1965). In general, results show that Portuguese subjects are more incremental than Italians. Moreover, significant differences have to be determined regarding motivational factors linked to school and socioeconomic level and gender. The research highlights the importance of macro-contextual factors in the social, economic, and political organizations that influence how people develop their motivational beliefs.",

    "abstract": "We sought to test the hypothesis that a novel 2-dimensional echocardiographic image analysis system using artificial intelligence-learned pattern recognition can rapidly and reproducibly calculate ejection fraction (EF).\nEchocardiographic EF by manual tracing is time consuming, and visual assessment is inherently subjective.\nWe studied 218 patients (72 female), including 165 with abnormal left ventricular (LV) function. Auto EF incorporated a database trained on >10,000 human EF tracings to automatically locate and track the LV endocardium from routine grayscale digital cineloops and calculate EF in 15 s. Auto EF results were independently compared with manually traced biplane Simpson's rule, visual EF, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset.\nAuto EF was possible in 200 (92%) of consecutive patients, of which 77% were completely automated and 23% required manual editing. Auto EF correlated well with manual EF (r = 0.98; 6% limits of agreement) and required less time per patient (48 +/- 26 s vs. 102 +/- 21 s; p < 0.01). Auto EF correlated well with visual EF by expert readers (r = 0.96; p < 0.001), but interobserver variability was greater (3.4 +/- 2.9% vs. 9.8 +/- 5.7%, respectively; p < 0.001). Visual EF was less accurate by novice readers (r = 0.82; 19% limits of agreement) and improved with trainee-operated Auto EF (r = 0.96; 7% limits of agreement). Auto EF also correlated with MRI EF (n = 21) (r = 0.95; 12% limits of agreement), but underestimated absolute volumes (r = 0.95; bias of -36 +/- 27 ml overall).\nAuto EF can automatically calculate EF similarly to results by manual biplane Simpson's rule and MRI, with less variability than visual EF, and has clinical potential.",

Taken together, these results suggest that persons within families (particularly offspring) may share similar cortical systems supporting those functions. Postmortem and in vivo imaging studies have linked dyslexia to abnormalities in the structures associated with the parietal operculum (PO) (e.g., planum temporale, supramarginal gyrus, and angular gyrus). In this paper we present data on a single family showing a link between dyslexia, superior nonverbal IQ and atypical PO presentation.

    "abstract": "Intelligence analysts commonly associate cases on the basis of similarities found in compared characteristics of scientific evidence. The present paper studies some of the inferential difficulties associated with such operations. An analysis is proposed that breaks down the reasoning process into inference to common source, and inference to case linkage. The former requires an approach to the difficulty associated with evaluating the similarities of items of evidence from different cases with no putative source being available. The latter requires consideration to be given to the relevance of evidence. Throughout the paper, probability theory is used to describe the nature of the proposed inferences. Graphical models are also introduced with the aim of providing further insight into the dependence and independence relationships assumed to hold among the various propositions considered. Notions from decision theory are used to discuss ways in which intelligence analysts may assist investigators in deciding whether or not cases should be considered as linked.",

    "abstract": "We examined associations between childhood intelligence and hospital admissions for injuries in adulthood.\nData were derived from a cohort study (=11103) involving individuals born in Aberdeen, Scotland, between 1950 and 1956.\nOverall, 1043 cohort members had at least 1 hospital admission resulting from an unintentional injury over 231152 person-years of risk. There were inverse linear associations between childhood intelligence assessed at the ages of 7, 9, and 11 years and having had a hospital admission stemming from an unintentional injury (gender-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for a 1-standard-deviation increase in intelligence test score at age 7 years = 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.70, 0.80). These associations were not markedly affected by adjustment for childhood socioeconomic status, maternal age or height, birthweight, or childhood growth. However, they were attenuated after adjustment for educational attainment (HR=0.85; 95% CI=0.78, 0.91).\nChildhood intelligence is related to hospital admissions for injuries in adulthood, and this relationship is partly explained by educational attainment. The association between childhood intelligence and injury may contribute to the association between childhood intelligence and premature mortality demonstrated in several studies.",

    "abstract": "The social intelligence hypothesis posits that complex cognition and enlarged \"executive brains\" evolved in response to challenges that are associated with social complexity. This hypothesis has been well supported, but some recent data are inconsistent with its predictions. It is becoming increasingly clear that multiple selective agents, and non-selective constraints, must have acted to shape cognitive abilities in humans and other animals. The task now is to develop a larger theoretical framework that takes into account both inter-specific differences and similarities in cognition. This new framework should facilitate consideration of how selection pressures that are associated with sociality interact with those that are imposed by non-social forms of environmental complexity, and how both types of functional demands interact with phylogenetic and developmental constraints.",

    "abstract": "Police interrogators routinely use deceptive techniques to obtain confessions from criminal suspects. The United States Executive Branch has attempted to justify coercive interrogation techniques in which physical or mental pain and suffering may be used during intelligence interrogations of persons labeled unlawful combatants. It may be appropriate for law enforcement, military, or intelligence personnel who are not physicians to use such techniques. However, forensic psychiatry ethical practice requires honesty, striving for objectivity, and respect for persons. Deceptive and coercive interrogation techniques violate these moral values. When a psychiatrist directly uses, works with others who use, or trains others to use deceptive or coercive techniques to obtain information in police, military, or intelligence interrogations, the psychiatrist breaches basic principles of ethics.",

    "abstract": "Cued-recall in episodic memory was investigated in relation to low and high cognitive support at retrieval, executive function level and fluid intelligence level in 81 healthy adults divided first into two age groups (young and elderly adults). The first analyses showed that age-related differences were greater when a low cognitive support was provided to recall the words. An individual index of loss of performance when the number of cues was decreased was then calculated. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the executive functions measure (perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) was a better candidate than the fluid intelligence measure (Cattell's culture fair test) to account for the age-related variance of the size of performance loss. These findings suggest that age differences in implementing strategic retrieval may be mainly due to a decline in executive functions.",

    "abstract": "Hormones are one of the regulatory systems influencing brain-cognition interactions and subsequent emotions and behavior in humans and animals. Sex hormones have been found to influence brain structures prenatally, so as to prepare targeted neuronal circuits for activation during and after puberty. Testosterone is believed to affect cognition and thinking in humans as well as between-sex differences in cognitive abilities.\nThe aim of this paper was to investigate associations between testosterone and different levels of intelligence in young prepubertal children of both sexes.\nTwo hundred and eighty four prepubertal children of both sexes between 6 and 9 years of age provided saliva samples. Of these, 107 were intellectually gifted (IQ above 130), 100 children of average intelligence--randomly chosen from general population (IQ between 70 and 130), and 77 children mentally challenged (IQ less than 70).\nOur results have revealed the differences in salivary testosterone levels in boys grouped according to IQ, intellectually gifted and mentally challenged boys having lower salivary testosterone levels than their peers characterized by average intelligence proposing the common biological characteristic of minority IQ groups on both ends of the Gauss curve. In girls, no differences in salivary testosterone levels were found among IQ groups.\nOur findings are the first that present the relationship between testosterone and the broad range of general IQ in childhood. The boys of average intelligence had significantly higher testosterone levels than both mentally challenged and intellectually gifted boys, with the latter two groups showing no significant difference between each other. The functional implications of the brain-cognition interactions remain to be fully explored with regard to the internal milieu influencing neural substrate.",

    "abstract": "The cholinergic neurotransmitter system is thought to be involved in many aspects of memory, attention, and higher cognition. In the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) sample, we have previously reported linkage and association to the cholinergic muscarinic 2 receptor gene (CHRM2) on chromosome 7 with evoked EEG oscillations (Jones et al. 2004), providing evidence that this gene may be involved in human brain dynamics and cognition. In addition, a small number of genetic markers were genotyped in CHRM2 in the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (Comings et al. 2003) and a Dutch family study (Gosso et al. 2006, in press) and both research groups found evidence that this gene may be involved in intelligence. In the COGA sample, we have extensively genotyped SNPs within and flanking the CHRM2 gene. We find evidence of association with multiple SNPs across CHRM2 and Performance IQ, as measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R). These results remain significant after taking into account alcohol dependence and depression diagnoses in the sample.",

Additionally, the extent to which both emotions and EI measures relate to intelligence is poorly understood. The current study was designed to address these issues. Participants (N = 138) completed the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), two emotions measures, as well as four intelligence tests. Results provide mixed support for the model hypothesized to underlie the MSCEIT, with emotions research and EI measures failing to load on the same factor. The emotions measures loaded on the same factor as intelligence measures. The validity of certain EI components (in particular, Emotion Perception), as currently assessed, appears equivocal.",

    "abstract": "The concept of \"emotional intelligence\" has been extensively popularized in the lay press and corporate world as individuals purport the potential ability of emotional intelligence to predict various markers of success. Emotional intelligence (EI) most commonly incorporates concepts of emotional expression and regulation, self-awareness, and empathy. The concept has been criticized by some for its loose definition and parallels to personality traits. Additionally, several limitations to the instruments used to measure emotional intelligence have been identified. This review examines the foundations of the definitions of emotional intelligence as well as existing educational research involving emotional intelligence, both within the health professions and externally. Recommendations for future research and research potential are discussed.",

    "abstract": "A positive association between intelligence (IQ) and height has been reported previously. It is generally assumed that this association reflects the effect of childhood environment on IQ, but there is still little research supporting directly this hypothesis. We studied the association between height and IQ in 209 Dutch twin pairs at the ages of 5, 7, 10 and 12 years, 208 twin pairs at 16 and 18 years of age and 567 twin pairs and their siblings in adulthood. The heritability of height was high in all cohorts and across all ages (a2 = 0.93 - 0.96). In adulthood, heritability was also high for full-scale IQ (FSIQ: a2 = 0.83-0.84) and somewhat lower for verbal IQ (VIQ: a2 = 0.66-0.84). In early childhood, the heritability was lower, and common environmental factors had a substantial effect on FSIQ and VIQ. A positive association of height and IQ was found in early childhood and adolescence. In adulthood, a correlation was found between height and FSIQ in young adulthood and between height and VIQ in middle age. All correlations could be ascribed to genetic factors influencing both height and IQ. Thus, these results show that the association between height and IQ should not be directly regarded as evidence for childhood living conditions affecting IQ, but the effect of genetic factors affecting independently or interacting with environmental factors should be considered as well.",

    "abstract": "The CHRM2 gene is thought to be involved in neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity and feedback regulation of acetylcholine release and has previously been implicated in higher cognitive processing. In a sample of 667 individuals from 304 families, we genotyped three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CHRM2 gene on 7q31-35. From all individuals, standardized intelligence measures were available. Using a test of within-family association, which controls for the possible effects of population stratification, a highly significant association was found between the CHRM2 gene and intelligence. The strongest association was between rs324650 and performance IQ (PIQ), where the T allele was associated with an increase of 4.6 PIQ points. In parallel with a large family-based association, we observed an attenuated - although still significant - population-based association, illustrating that population stratification may decrease our chances of detecting allele-trait associations. Such a mechanism has been predicted earlier, and this article is one of the first to empirically show that family-based association methods are not only needed to guard against false positives, but are also invaluable in guarding against false negatives.",

    "abstract": "The \"Machiavellian intelligence\" hypothesis (or the \"social brain\" hypothesis) posits that large brains and distinctive cognitive abilities of humans have evolved via intense social competition in which social competitors developed increasingly sophisticated \"Machiavellian\" strategies as a means to achieve higher social and reproductive success. Here we build a mathematical model aiming to explore this hypothesis. In the model, genes control brains which invent and learn strategies (memes) which are used by males to gain advantage in competition for mates. We show that the dynamics of intelligence has three distinct phases. During the dormant phase only newly invented memes are present in the population. During the cognitive explosion phase the population's meme count and the learning ability, cerebral capacity (controlling the number of different memes that the brain can learn and use), and Machiavellian fitness of individuals increase in a runaway fashion. During the saturation phase natural selection resulting from the costs of having large brains checks further increases in cognitive abilities. Overall, our results suggest that the mechanisms underlying the \"Machiavellian intelligence\" hypothesis can indeed result in the evolution of significant cognitive abilities on the time scale of 10 to 20 thousand generations. We show that cerebral capacity evolves faster and to a larger degree than learning ability. Our model suggests that there may be a tendency toward a reduction in cognitive abilities (driven by the costs of having a large brain) as the reproductive advantage of having a large brain decreases and the exposure to memes increases in modern societies.",

    "abstract": "Psychological assessment of cognitive functioning among clinical groups that include psychiatric and geriatric patients is a difficult task. This study examines the interrelationship between intelligence and concentrative ability for a group of psychiatric patients. Intellectual and concentrative ability were assessed among a group of 85, predominantly schizophrenic, patients (mean age 32 years) from a Sheltered Workshop (GWN) and neurological-psychiatric institutionalized care units within the Neuss region of North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany. Moderate bivariate relationships were found between all IQ subtests and the concentration performance variables (d2). A substantial overlap in variance was found between \"nonverbal\" intelligence and the concentration variables (using multiple regression and discrimination analysis). Error rate on the concentration task was significantly negatively correlated with the IQ variables, the magnitude of the correlation coefficient increasing as a function of the time on the task. Future studies would benefit from comparisons in factor structure similarity between abnormal and normal groups as well as between-clinical groups. At a practical level, the relatively easy use (less complex administration) and less obtrusive (hence, low level of personal threat) and inexpensive procedures of the letter cancellation task makes it a useful, albeit \"approximate\", measure of cognitive functioning.",

    "abstract": "Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects periodic changes taking place in heart rhythm, which are controlled by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and external factors. The aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between HRV and the level of intelligence using the Raven Advanced Matrices Test in 95 men (mean age 41.6 +/-3.7 SD yr) who experienced myocardial infarction during two years preceding the psychophysiological examination. HRV was analyzed from the EEG signal recordings in the time and spectral domains. It was found that post-myocardial infarct men of the higher than average intelligence had significantly increased HRV; the finding was reflected in the analysis of both time and frequency domains. Although both sympathetic and parasympathetic components showed an increase in the frequency domain, the former did disproportionately more, achieving substantial predominance. The results indicate that active mental processes and attitude, linked to a higher intelligence level, might be a beneficial prognostic marker, as is higher HRV, for the overall post-infarction cardiac mortality and for return of such subjects back to normal life. The corollary is that the assessment of IQ in post-infarction patients seems a simple screening method that may help presage the health and social course the patient takes.",

In the one subtest \"Competence in Realism\" nearly 50 percent of the children could not understand the relevant non verbal instruction.

    "abstract": "This research examined the preliminary effects of Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) on social cognition in early course schizophrenia, using an objective, performance-based measure of emotional intelligence. Individuals in the early course of schizophrenia were randomly assigned to either CET (n=18) or Enriched Supportive Therapy (n=20), and assessed at baseline and after 1 year of treatment with the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. A series of analyses of covariance showed highly significant (p=.005) and large (Cohen's d=.96) effects favoring CET for improving emotional intelligence, with the most pronounced improvements occurring in patients' ability to understand and manage their own and others' emotions. These findings lend preliminary support to the previously documented benefits of CET on social cognition in schizophrenia, and suggest that such benefits can be extended to patients in the early course of the illness.",

    "abstract": "Humans show considerable additive genetic variance in cognitive ability or general intelligence (g) but the genes that influence this variation are largely unknown. It is suggested here that the X-linked androgen receptor gene (AR) has a major modifying effect on speed of neuronal transmission and thus on g. The AR is polymorphic in its N-terminal transactivation domain which encodes a polyglutamine tract (CAGn) with a parametric mean of n=21 CAG repeats and normal variation between n=11 and n=30 repeats . Very low repeat numbers are associated with mental retardation, repeat numbers above 30 with reduced cognitive function, and CAGn greater than 40 with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. Within the range of 11-30 repeats short CAG chains are associated with high androgen sensitivity and high sperm counts. Despite this, all human populations contain many individuals with n>21 repeats. I suggest that within the range of 11-30 repeats there is a positive association with speed of neuronal transmission and values of g. The advantage of high g and the consequent spread of alleles for high CAGn will be countered by the negative effects on sperm production. Below CAGn=11 and above CAGn=30 neuronal speed may reduce, thus leading to reductions in g and loss of function of neurons. In support of the model I discuss the link between the X-chromosome and g, the comparative structure of the AR gene in the primates, and the variation in CAGn and g in human ethnic groups.",

    "abstract": "A number of studies have found that Ashkenazi Jews in the United States have a high average IQ. It has been proposed by Cochran, Hardy and Harpending (2006) that this can be explained by the occupational constraints imposed on the Ashkenazi for many centuries in Europe, when they were largely confined to money-lending. They propose that this selected for the high verbal and mathematical intelligence that has several times been found in American Ashkenazim. The current study investigates how far this theory holds for European and Oriental Jews in Israel. A review of studies shows that Oriental Jews in Israel have an average IQ 14 points lower than that of European (largely Ashkenazi) Jews. It is proposed that this difference can be explained in terms of the Cochran, Hardy and Harpending theory because Oriental Jews were permitted to engage in a much wider range of occupations and hence did not come under the selection pressure to develop the high verbal and mathematical intelligence that was present for Ashkenazim.",

    "abstract": "Wilkinson contends that economic inequality reduces the health and life expectancy of the whole population but his argument does not make sense within its own evolutionary framework. Recent evolutionary psychological theory suggests that the human brain, adapted to the ancestral environment, has difficulty comprehending and dealing with entities and situations that did not exist in the ancestral environment and that general intelligence evolved as a domain-specific adaptation to solve evolutionarily novel problems. Since most dangers to health in the contemporary society are evolutionarily novel, it follows that more intelligent individuals are better able to recognize and deal with such dangers and live longer. Consistent with the theory, the macro-level analyses show that income inequality and economic development have no effect on life expectancy at birth, infant mortality and age-specific mortality net of average intelligence quotient (IQ) in 126 countries. They also show that an average IQ has a very large and significant effect on population health but not in the evolutionarily familiar sub-Saharan Africa. At the micro level, the General Social Survey data show that, while both income and intelligence have independent positive effects on self-reported health, intelligence has a stronger effect than income. The data collectively suggest that individuals in wealthier and more egalitarian societies live longer and stay healthier, not because they are wealthier or more egalitarian but because they are more intelligent.",

    "abstract": "Variation in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume of the adult human brain is primarily genetically determined. Moreover, total brain volume is positively correlated with general intelligence, and both share a common genetic origin. However, although genetic effects on morphology of specific GM areas in the brain have been studied, the heritability of focal WM is unknown. Similarly, it is unresolved whether there is a common genetic origin of focal GM and WM structures with intelligence. We explored the genetic influence on focal GM and WM densities in magnetic resonance brain images of 54 monozygotic and 58 dizygotic twin pairs and 34 of their siblings. For genetic analyses, we used structural equation modeling and voxel-based morphometry. To explore the common genetic origin of focal GM and WM areas with intelligence, we obtained cross-trait/cross-twin correlations in which the focal GM and WM densities of each twin are correlated with the psychometric intelligence quotient of his/her cotwin. Genes influenced individual differences in left and right superior occipitofrontal fascicle (heritability up to 0.79 and 0.77), corpus callosum (0.82, 0.80), optic radiation (0.69, 0.79), corticospinal tract (0.78, 0.79), medial frontal cortex (0.78, 0.83), superior frontal cortex (0.76, 0.80), superior temporal cortex (0.80, 0.77), left occipital cortex (0.85), left postcentral cortex (0.83), left posterior cingulate cortex (0.83), right parahippocampal cortex (0.69), and amygdala (0.80, 0.55). Intelligence shared a common genetic origin with superior occipitofrontal, callosal, and left optical radiation WM and frontal, occipital, and parahippocampal GM (phenotypic correlations up to 0.35). These findings point to a neural network that shares a common genetic origin with human intelligence.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effects of head growth prenatally, during infancy, and during later periods of development on cognitive function at the ages of 4 and 8 years.\nWe studied 633 term-born children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort whose head circumference was measured at birth and at regular intervals thereafter. Their cognitive function was assessed with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence at the age of 4 years and with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children at the age of 8 years. Linear regression analysis was used to calculate postnatal head growth between successive time points, conditional on previous size, and to examine the relationship between head growth during different periods of development and later IQ.\nWhen the influence of head growth was distinguished for different periods, only prenatal growth and growth during infancy were associated with subsequent IQ. At 4 years, after adjustment for parental characteristics, full-scale IQ increased an average of 2.41 points for each 1-SD increase in head circumference at birth and 1.97 points for each 1-SD increase in head growth during infancy, conditional on head size at birth. At 8 years, head circumference at birth was no longer associated with IQ, but head growth during infancy remained a significant predictor, with full-scale IQ increasing an average of 1.56 points for each 1-SD increase in growth.\nThe brain volume a child achieves by the age of 1 year helps determine later intelligence. Growth in brain volume after infancy may not compensate for poorer earlier growth.",

    "abstract": "Scores on cognitive tasks used in intelligence tests correlate positively with each other, that is, they display a positive manifold of correlations. The positive manifold is often explained by positing a dominant latent variable, the g factor, associated with a single quantitative cognitive or biological process or capacity. In this article, a new explanation of the positive manifold based on a dynamical model is proposed, in which reciprocal causation or mutualism plays a central role. It is shown that the positive manifold emerges purely by positive beneficial interactions between cognitive processes during development. A single underlying g factor plays no role in the model. The model offers explanations of important findings in intelligence research, such as the hierarchical factor structure of intelligence, the low predictability of intelligence from early childhood performance, the integration/differentiation effect, the increase in heritability of g, and the Jensen effect, and is consistent with current explanations of the Flynn effect.",

    "abstract": "Three studies used J. D. Mayer and P. Salovey's (1997) theory of emotional intelligence (EI) as a framework to examine the role of emotional abilities (assessed with both self-report and performance measures) in social functioning. Self-ratings were assessed in ways that mapped onto the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), a validated performance measure of EI. In Study 1, self-ratings and MSCEIT scores were not strongly correlated. In Study 2, men's MSCEIT scores, but not self-ratings, correlated with perceived social competence after personality measures were held constant. In Study 3, only the MSCEIT predicted real-time social competence, again, just for men. Implications for analyzing how emotional abilities contribute to social behavior are discussed, as is the importance of incorporating gender into theoretical frameworks and study designs.",

    "abstract": "In 16th Century Prague, Rabbi Loew created a Golem, a humanoid made of clay, to protect his community. When the Golem became too dangerous to his surroundings, he was dismantled. This Jewish theme illustrates some of the guiding principles in its approach to the moral dilemmas inherent in future technologies, such as artificial intelligence and robotics. Man is viewed as having received the power to improve upon creation and develop technologies to achieve them, with the proviso that appropriate safeguards are taken. Ethically, not-harming is viewed as taking precedence over promoting good. Jewish ethical thinking approaches these novel technological possibilities with a cautious optimism that mankind will derive their benefits without coming to harm.",

    "abstract": "Relatively few studies have investigated associations between volume of alcohol consumption and psychological characteristics in normal samples. A sub-sample, comprising 363 men and 331 women between 29 and 34 years of age, was selected from the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort on the basis of perinatal records. The sample was divided into four consumption categories: abstainers (including occasional drinkers), light, moderate, and risk drinkers. ANOVA and relevant contrasts were used to test the significance of differences among consumption categories. Both abstaining and risk drinking were associated with low social status family background, low education and intelligence. Abstaining was associated with low disinhibition and social recognition scores, while risk drinking was associated with high neuroticism and, in males, high disinhibition, low social recognition, and low achievement scores. Compared with light drinkers, a more \"carefree\" life orientation characterized male moderate drinkers, while relatively high scores on anxiety, dysthymia, and somatoform symptom scales characterized female moderate drinkers.",

    "abstract": "The WAIS-III Digit Span and Vocabulary subtests were investigated as indicators of feigned cognitive impairment. Participants included 64 undergraduates randomly assigned to control, symptom-coached, or test-coached groups. Six previously researched validity indicators were examined. We hypothesized that symptom-coached participants would perform worse relative to test-coached simulators. Analyses determined both simulator groups performed lower than controls on all indicators except Vocabulary. Symptom-coached participants, however, did not differ from test-coached participants on any indicator. Classification accuracies for these six indicators ranged from 42 to 78%. While the WAIS-III validity indicators hold some promise, they should not be employed as independent measures.",

    "abstract": "Oppositely valenced forces may be at work to influence rates of placement of children into mental retardation programs. On one hand, educational policies regarding intellectual disability and concerns about overrepresentation of minorities in special education may contribute to lower placement rates; on the other hand, more difficult intelligence test norms may be a countervailing force, increasing placement rates. An analysis of longitudinal data on state and national level placement rates reveals that a lengthy and steep 12-year decline in students receiving mental retardation services reversed shortly after the introduction of the WISC-III in 1991. This phenomenon has relevance for death-penalty cases, because this historical pattern may affect the ability to establish whether an adult meets the developmental period onset criterion for mental retardation.",

In the first hypothesis, it is suggested that it is due to school policy concerning school entry, whereas the second suggests that a seasonally patterned exposure such as temperature, maternal nutrition, or infection during critical periods of brain development have a lasting effect on intelligence.\nTo determine whether childhood performance on tests of different domains of intelligence is patterned by season of birth and to examine possible mechanisms for any associations.\n12,150 individuals born in Aberdeen, Scotland between 1950 and 1956.\nBirth cohort study in which the variation in different domains of childhood intelligence measured at ages 7, 9, and 11 by season of birth were examined.\nReading ability at age 9 and arithmetic ability at age 11 varied by season of birth, with lowest scores among those born in autumn or early winter (September-December) and highest scores among those born in later winter or spring (February-April); p=.002 for joint sine-cosine functions for reading ability at age 9 and p=.05 for sine-cosine function for arithmetic ability at age 11. The child's perception and understanding of pictorial differences at age 7, verbal reasoning at 11, and English language ability at 11 did not vary by season of birth. Age at starting primary school and age relative to class peers were both associated with the different measurements of childhood intelligence and both attenuated the association between month of birth and reading ability at age 9 and arithmetic ability at age 11 towards the null. Both adjusted and unadjusted differences in reading ability at age 9 and arithmetic ability at age 11 between those born from September to December compared with other times of the year were less than 0.1 of a standard deviation of the test scores.

    "abstract": "Examination of measurement invariance tests the assumption that the model underlying a set of test scores is directly comparable across groups. The observation of measurement invariance provides fundamental evidence for the inference that scores on a test afford equivalent measurement of the same psychological traits among diverse groups. Groups may be derived from different psychosocial backgrounds or different clinical presentations. In the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III)/Wechsler Memory Scale-III (WMS-III) Technical Manual (Psychological Corporation, 2002), there appears to be a breakdown in factor structure among the standardization cases in older adults. In this study, the authors evaluated the invariance of the measurement model of the WAIS-III across 5 age bands. All components of the measurement model were examined. Overall, the evidence pointed to invariance across age of a modified 4-factor model that included cross-loadings for the Similarities and Arithmetic subtests. These results support the utility of the WAIS-III as a measure of stable intelligence traits across a wide age range.",

    "abstract": "Age-related gross head size; adjusted age-related change in brain volume and carotid and basilar blood flow; as well as scores on 3 tests of fluid intelligence (gf), 2 tests of information-processing speed, 2 memory tests, and 3 tests of executive function were obtained from 69 volunteers aged from 62 to 84 years. Brain volume negatively predicted scores on all 10 cognitive tasks, accounting for up to 78% of age-related variance in scores on the speed tasks and on 1 executive task. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) negatively predicted scores on 8 cognitive tasks, accounting for up to 36% of age-related variance in speed scores. However, neither brain volume nor CBF accounted for significant age-related variance between individuals on any of 3 gf tests. We conclude that speed, but not gf, is an exceptionally sensitive behavioral index of the progress of gross brain changes that affect cognition in old age and that speed and gf do not reflect integrity of the same functional systems.",

    "abstract": "Benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BECTS) is a form of focal idiopathic epilepsy, with seizure remission by the age of 18. Recent studies have suggested that some children with BECTS can suffer from deficits of memory, attention and learning ability and in auditory-verbal and performance sub-tests. On the other hand, alterations in the baseline brain electrical activity determined by using the quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) have been described. The objective of this study was to evaluate the absolute and relative powers in the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands of the qEEG in children with BECTS, and their relation to IQ measurements (WISC-III). Twenty-six 8 to 11-year-old children with BECTS were studied, paired with a control group of healthy children according to age and gender. It was shown that the absolute delta and theta powers were statistically greater in the children with BECTS than in the control group, at almost all the electrodes. In the children with BECTS, a negative correlation (Pearson's correlation test) was observed at various electrodes between the absolute delta and theta powers and the performance IQ. These data indicate a possible relationship between maturational disturbance in the brain electrical activity development and the tendency for inferior cognitive performance in children with BECTS.",

    "abstract": "It was recently shown that cognitive functions requiring more widespread brain integration relate to slower EEG activity, whereas cognitive performance supported by local brain integration is associated with faster EEG components (Von Stein & Sarnthein, 2000). Associations were studied between performance on WAIS and resting EEG spectral parameters in heroin abusers and normal young males. The most prominent associations between WAIS and EEG variables were consistently registered in polar and lateral frontal/temporal derivations. WAIS subtests predominantly loading on retrieval from long-term memory stores were significantly associated with delta bands mean frequencies. Subtests with strong working memory component related to theta2 mean frequency at temporal leads. Subtests requiring problem-solving operations correlated with alpha bands parameters, whereas psychomotor speed was associated with beta power. The data are in agreement with the hypothesis of Von Stein & Sarnthein (2000).",

    "abstract": "AutoNRT is an automated system that measures electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) thresholds from the auditory nerve with the Nucleus Freedom cochlear implant. ECAP thresholds along the electrode array are useful in objectively fitting cochlear implant systems for individual use. This paper provides the first detailed description of the AutoNRT algorithm and its expert systems, and reports the clinical success of AutoNRT to date.\nAutoNRT determines thresholds by visual detection, using two decision tree expert systems that automatically recognise ECAPs. The expert systems are guided by a dataset of 5393 neural response measurements. The algorithm approaches threshold from lower stimulus levels, ensuring recipient safety during postoperative measurements. Intraoperative measurements use the same algorithm but proceed faster by beginning at stimulus levels much closer to threshold. When searching for ECAPs, AutoNRT uses a highly specific expert system (specificity of 99% during training, 96% during testing; sensitivity of 91% during training, 89% during testing). Once ECAPs are established, AutoNRT uses an unbiased expert system to determine an accurate threshold. Throughout the execution of the algorithm, recording parameters (such as implant amplifier gain) are automatically optimised when needed.\nIn a study that included 29 intraoperative and 29 postoperative subjects (a total of 418 electrodes), AutoNRT determined a threshold in 93% of cases where a human expert also determined a threshold. When compared to the median threshold of multiple human observers on 77 randomly selected electrodes, AutoNRT performed as accurately as the 'average' clinician.\nAutoNRT has demonstrated a high success rate and a level of performance that is comparable with human experts. It has been used in many clinics worldwide throughout the clinical trial and commercial launch of Nucleus Custom Sound Suite, significantly streamlining the clinical procedures associated with cochlear implant use.",

This evidence implies that the effect of a shift in the national IQ on the suicide rate is proportional, not absolute. As a rule of thumb, a 5-point shift in national IQ roughly corresponds to a 50% change in the national suicide rate.",

    "abstract": "The ability to act on information flexibly is one of the cornerstones of intelligent behavior. As particularly informative example, tool-oriented behavior has been investigated to determine to which extent nonhuman animals understand means-end relations, object affordances, and have specific motor skills. Even planning with foresight, goal-directed problem solving and immediate causal inference have been a focus of research. However, these cognitive abilities may not be restricted to tool-using animals but may be found also in animals that show high levels of curiosity, object exploration and manipulation, and extractive foraging behavior. The kea, a New Zealand parrot, is a particularly good example. We here review findings from laboratory experiments and field observations of keas revealing surprising cognitive capacities in the physical domain. In an experiment with captive keas, the success rate of individuals that were allowed to observe a trained conspecific was significantly higher than that of naive control subjects due to their acquisition of some functional understanding of the task through observation. In a further experiment using the string-pulling task, a well-probed test for means-end comprehension, we found the keas finding an immediate solution that could not be improved upon in nine further trials. We interpreted their performance as insightful in the sense of being sensitive of the relevant functional properties of the task and thereby producing a new adaptive response without trial-and-error learning. Together, these findings contribute to the ongoing debate on the distribution of higher cognitive skills in the animal kingdom by showing high levels of sensorimotor intelligence in animals that do not use tools. In conclusion, we suggest that the 'Technical intelligence hypothesis' (Byrne, Machiavellian intelligence II: extensions and evaluations, pp 289-211, 1997), which has been proposed to explain the origin of the ape/monkey grade-shift in intelligence by a selection pressure upon an increased efficiency in foraging behavior, should be extended, that is, applied to some birds as well.",

    "abstract": "Adaptations of the National Adult Reading Test (NART) for assessing premorbid intelligence in languages other than English requires (a) generating word-items that are rare and do not follow grapheme-to-phoneme mappings common in that language, and (b) subsequent validation against a cognitive battery normed on the population of interest. Such tests exist for Italy, France, Spain, and Argentina, all normed against national versions of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Given the varieties of Spanish spoken in the United States, the adaptation of the Spanish Word Accentuation Test (WAT) requires re-validating the original word list, plus possible new items, against a cognitive battery that has been normed on Spanish-speakers from many countries. This study reports the generation of 55 additional words and revalidation in a sample of 80 older, Spanish-dominant immigrants. The Bater\u00eda Woodcock-Mu\u00f1oz Revisada (BWM-R), normed on Spanish speakers from six countries and five U.S. states, was used to establish criterion validity. The original WAT word list accounted for 77% of the variance in the BWM-R and 58% of the variance in Ravens Colored Progressive Matrices, suggesting that the unmodified list possesses adequate predictive validity as an indicator of intelligence. Regression equations are provided for estimating BWM-R and Ravens scores from WAT scores.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the validity of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III) inter-subtest scatter (as measured by the scaled score range) as an indication of cognitive impairment due to brain dysfunction. Participants were 174 individuals with documented brain damage. Means for age, education, and WAIS-III full-scale IQ were 49.19 years (SD = 15.33), 12.57 years, (SD = 2.78), and 88.45 (SD = 17.78). The scatter ranges for brain-damaged participants were compared with those of the WAIS-III standardization sample. Results indicated that the full-scale IQ is significantly correlated with amount of scatter, r(172) = .42, p < .0001, so that a definitive answer to the question requires control of full-scale IQ. In the present analyses, inter-subtest scatter among the individuals for the sample as a whole was no greater than that for persons in the standardization sample, but subtest scatter was significantly greater for participants with IQs > or = 90. This finding suggests that there may be small differences in scatter between brain-damaged persons and normal controls, but that scatter is relatively insensitive to the presence of brain damage or dysfunction. Therefore, interpretation of marked inter-subtest variability as a sign of brain damage appears unwarranted.",

    "abstract": "The current study evaluated the utility of the Digit Span subtest in discriminating patients with mild head trauma from individuals referred for independent neuropsychological evaluation with objective evidence of poor effort. Various indices from the Digit Span subtest were evaluated to determine the best discriminator of brain injury from poor motivation patient groups: Digit Span Forward, Digit Span Backwards, Reliable Digit Span, Digit Span Age-Corrected Scaled Score, and the difference score between the Vocabulary and Digit Span scaled scores. The Digit Span scaled score was found to be the best discriminating index. A cutoff score of less than or equal to 7 accurately classified 75% of persons in the incomplete effort group and 69% of persons in the TBI group. Application of this cutoff score to a non-litigating mild brain injury group yielded a 77% correct classification rate. However, Digit Span scaled score accounted for a modest amount of variation and it is not recommended as a stand-alone validity measure.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study is to examine the association of depression with intelligence and education in patients with Parkinson's disease treated with bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation (STN-DBS). The literature has been contradictory concerning depression in Parkinson's disease patients. Some studies have shown less depression in Parkinson's disease patients with more education not treated with STN-DBS. Other recently published studies indicate that STN-DBS improves the depression associated with Parkinson's disease. No studies have examined the correlation of these factors with depression in Parkinson's disease patients treated with STN-DBS. We administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) pre- and postoperatively to 21 Parkinson's disease patients (seven women, 14 men, ages 49-75) who underwent STN-DBS. The postoperative scores of the lower 50th percentile (n=8) of the Verbal Comprehensive Index of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) decreased significantly (P=0.036), while the upper 50th percentile (n=13) remained nearly constant (P=0.802). Furthermore, as the education increased from highschool to graduate level, patients demonstrated less improvement in depressive symptoms postoperatively. These findings suggest that Parkinson's disease patients with lower intelligence test scores and less education benefit more with regards to depressive symptomatology after STN-DBS than patients with higher scores and education.",

    "abstract": "Forensic intelligence can be viewed as comprising two parts, one directly concerning intelligence delivery in forensic casework, the other considering performance aspects of forensic work, loosely termed here as business intelligence. Forensic casework can be viewed as processes that produce an intelligence product useful to police investigations. Traditionally, forensic intelligence production has been confined to discipline-specific activity. This paper examines the concepts, processes and intelligence products delivered in forensic casework, the information repositories available from forensic examinations, and ways to produce within- and across-discipline casework correlations by using information technology to capitalise on the information sets available. Such analysis presents opportunities to improve forensic intelligence services as well as challenges for technical solutions to deliver appropriate data-mining capabilities for available information sets, such as digital photographs. Business intelligence refers primarily to examination of efficiency and effectiveness of forensic service delivery. This paper discusses measures of forensic activity and their relationship to crime outcomes as a measure of forensic effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "The Oklahoma Premorbid Intelligence Estimate-3 (OPIE-3) combines Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-3rd edition (WAIS-III) subtest raw scores (vocabulary, information, matrix reasoning, and picture completion) and demographic data (i.e., age, education, gender, ethnicity, and region) to predict FSIQ scores. Differences between OPIE-3 estimated FSIQ scores and actual FSIQ scores were compared across 13 age groups in a random sample (N=1201) of the WAIS-III standardization sample. There were mean differences in estimated FSIQ between age groups (P<.01). There was a trend that the OPIE-3 algorithms underestimated FSIQ for individuals 16-17 (2.7 points) and 80-89 years old (3.5 points). However, the differences in estimation errors were small and the percentage of individuals misclassified by more than 10 FSIQ points by age group was similar across groups. The OPIE-3(2ST), OPIE-3MR, and OPIE-3VOC yielded robust estimates of FSIQ across age groups in a neurologically intact sample. Limitations, particularly with individuals aged 16-17 and 85-89 years, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Optimisation and harmonisation of analytical and statistical methodology have been carried out between two forensic laboratories (Lausanne, CH and Lyon, F) in order to provide drug intelligence for cross-border cocaine seizures. The aim was to improve the gas chromatographic analysis of cocaine samples for profiling. Some important validation parameters were tested to verify the developed method and demonstrate its profiling capacity: the selectivity of the method with retention time reproducibility, the choice of a derivatisation agent improving the chromatography (MSTFA, BSA, TMSI and BSTFA+TMCS 1%), the cutting agents influence (matrix effect), the influence of the sample storage conditions and the sample quantity to weigh for analyses. Eight main alkaloids, which represent the sample signature, have been selected: ecgonine methyl ester, ecgonine, tropacocaine, benzoylecgonine, norcocaine, cis- and trans-cinnamoylcocaine and 3,4,5-trimethoxycocaine. Their stability in the solvent used (CHCl(3)/pyridine) was demonstrated. In order to reach the final objective, which is the comparison of samples seized and analyzed in two different laboratories, the harmonisation of the profiling method between the two laboratories had to be ensured and is the subject of ongoing research.",

    "abstract": "Organised criminality is a great concern for national/international security. The demonstration of complex crimes is increasingly dependant on knowledge distributed within law-enforcement agencies and scientific disciplines. This separation of knowledge creates difficulties in reconstructing and prosecuting such crimes. Basic interdisciplinary research in drug intelligence combined with crime analysis, forensic intelligence, and traditional law enforcement investigation is leading to important advances in crime investigation support. Laboratory results constitute one highly dependable source of information that is both reliable and testable. Their operational use can support investigation and even provide undetected connections or organisation of structure. The foremost difficulties encountered by drug analysts are not principally of a chemical or analytical nature, but methodologies to extract parameters or features that are deemed to be crucial for handling and contextualising drug profiling data. An organised memory has been developed in order to provide accurate, timely, useful and meaningful information for linking spatially and temporally distinct events on a national and international level (including cross-border phenomena). Literature has already pointed out that forensic case data are amenable for use in an intelligence perspective if data and knowledge of specialised actors are appropriately organised, shared and processed. As a particular form of forensic case data, the authors' research focuses on parameters obtained through the systematic physical and chemical profiling of samples of illicit drugs. The procedure is used to infer and characterise links between samples that originate from the same and different seizures. The discussion will not, however, focus on how samples are actually analysed and compared as substantial literature on this topic already exists. Rather, attention is primarily drawn to an active and close collaboration between magistrates, forensic scientists, law enforcement investigators and crime analysts from different institutions with the aim of generating, using and validating relevant profiling case data as integral part of investigative and crime analysis processes. Original advances are highlighted through experiences from criminal investigations of offences related to the unlawful importation, exportation, supply and possession of illicit drugs.",

    "abstract": "This paper elaborates the hypothesis that the unique demography and sociology of Ashkenazim in medieval Europe selected for intelligence. Ashkenazi literacy, economic specialization, and closure to inward gene flow led to a social environment in which there was high fitness payoff to intelligence, specifically verbal and mathematical intelligence but not spatial ability. As with any regime of strong directional selection on a quantitative trait, genetic variants that were otherwise fitness reducing rose in frequency. In particular we propose that the well-known clusters of Ashkenazi genetic diseases, the sphingolipid cluster and the DNA repair cluster in particular, increase intelligence in heterozygotes. Other Ashkenazi disorders are known to increase intelligence. Although these disorders have been attributed to a bottleneck in Ashkenazi history and consequent genetic drift, there is no evidence of any bottleneck. Gene frequencies at a large number of autosomal loci show that if there was a bottleneck then subsequent gene flow from Europeans must have been very large, obliterating the effects of any bottleneck. The clustering of the disorders in only a few pathways and the presence at elevated frequency of more than one deleterious allele at many of them could not have been produced by drift. Instead these are signatures of strong and recent natural selection.",

    "abstract": "Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, has been shown to be efficacious for treatment of psychotic and mood disorders in adults. This prospective, open-label study was conducted to examine the safety and usefulness of olanzapine in treating disruptive behavior disorders in adolescents with subaverage intelligence.\nSixteen adolescents (ages 13-17 years) with borderline to moderate mental retardation and disruptive behavior were enrolled in an 8-week olanzapine trial (5-20 mg/day). Dependent measures included the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, Conners Parent Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impressions, and two side effects scales.\nStatistically significant improvement (p <.002) was found on the Irritability and Hyperactivity subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the Conners Parent Rating Scale Hyperactivity Index. No subjects developed extrapyramidal side effects. However, four were terminated prematurely from the trial because of either worsening of symptoms (requiring psychiatric inpatient hospitalization in two subjects) or side effects. The most common side effect for the sample was weight gain (averaging 12.7 lb), with 67% of subjects gaining > or =10 lb. Although there was also a statistically significant increase in prolactin levels, no subjects reported prolactin-related side effects (e.g., gynecomastia, galactorhea, amenorrhea).\nOlanzapine may be useful in treating disruptive behavior in adolescents with subaverage intelligence. However, side effects, especially weight gain, are a significant issue. Future double-blind, placebo-controlled studies need to confirm these findings and assess long-term safety and outcome of olanzapine treatment.",

    "abstract": "In the present study 3 alternative causal models concerning the relationships between implicit theories of intelligence, perceived academic competence, and school achievement were tested. The direction of changes in implicit theories and perceived competence during early adolescence also was examined. A total of 187 fifth and sixth graders were tested and retested a year later, when they were sixth and seventh graders, respectively. Cross-lagged regression analyses indicated that school achievement determined the adoption of a particular implicit theory through the mediation of perceived competence. Implicit theories were found to change toward the adoption of more incremental beliefs and perceived academic competence declined; however, high achievers, as compared with their low- and middle-level classmates, adopted more incremental beliefs and had significantly higher perceived competence.",

    "abstract": "Two of the most securely established findings in the biology of intelligence are the relationship between reaction time (RT) and intelligence, and the heritability of intelligence. To investigate why RT may related to intelligence, researchers have used a variety of techniques to subdivide RT into cognitive and motor components. In the current study, magnetoencephalographic (MEG) dipole latencies were used to examine the speed and timing of specific brain processing stages engaged during visually cued simple and choice reaction time tasks. Simple and choice reaction time and timing of MEG sources were considered in relation to fluid intelligence (as measured by the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices, RAPM). To address heritability of intelligence, developmental instability (DI) was assessed, measured here as fluctuating asymmetry. DI represents the degree to which an organism is susceptible to developmental stress arising from both environmental and genomic sources. Analyses showed that choice, but not simple reaction time was negatively correlated with RAPM score. MEG revealed a set of complex relationships between the timing of regional brain activations and psychometric intelligence. The neural component associated with integration of sensory and motor information was most associated with RAPM compared to other components. Higher values of fluctuating asymmetry predicted reduced psychometric intelligence, a result suggesting that some part of the variance of the heritability of intelligence reflects DI. Fluctuating asymmetry was significantly and negatively correlated with timing during all components of task completion. These observations suggest that fluid intelligence is primarily related to speed during processing associated with decision time, while fluctuating asymmetry predicted slower processing across all stages of information processing.",

One hundred and seventy-five adults wrote about one of the following three topics: positive experiences with a cue for emotion regulation reflection, positive experiences without this cue, or a control writing topic. Multivariate analysis showed a significant time (pretest, posttest, and follow-up) by group effect. Writing about positive emotional experiences with an emotion regulation cue led to significant increases in emotional intelligence and life satisfaction at posttest and the increase in life satisfaction was maintained at 2-week follow-up. Further, participants who were cued to reflect on emotional regulation while writing about positive experiences rated their emotional intelligence significantly higher than the participants in the control writing group both at posttest and at follow-up. There were no significant differences in emotional intelligence or life satisfaction between those who were cued to reflect on emotional regulation while writing about positive experiences and those who wrote about positive experiences without such a cue.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) may predict stress responses and coping strategies in a variety of applied settings. This study compares EI and the personality factors of the Five Factor Model (FFM) as predictors of task-induced stress responses. Participants (N = 200) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 task conditions, 3 of which were designed to be stressful. Results confirmed that low EI was related to worry states and avoidance coping, even with the FFM statistically controlled. However, EI was not specifically related to task-induced changes in stress state. Results also confirmed that Neuroticism related to distress, worry, and emotion-focused coping, and Conscientiousness predicted use of task-focused coping. The applied utility of EI and personality measures is discussed.",

Although rumination syndrome is classified as a functional esophageal disorder according to the Rome II criteria, it is not well known in Japan, and there have been no previous reports of it in an adult with normal intelligence. Since patients with rumination syndrome are often misdiagnosed and receive unnecessary treatment, awareness of it by physicians is important.",

    "abstract": "Medications are an intentional and purposeful means to the successful management of many chronic diseases. In the treatment of disease caused by HIV, adherence to medication is of particular concern because any level of nonadherence, often a few missed doses, will lead eventually to the development of drug resistance. Many predictors of poor adherence to HIV medications have been identified as significant factors in adherence. Among these is the emotional aspect. The purpose of this study was to examine emotional intelligence (EI) and adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy in individuals who are infected with HIV. EI is defined as the ability to perceive and express emotions, facilitate emotions, understand and reason with emotion, and manage emotions. EI has been correlated with various aspects of success in life. In this study, EI was measured by the Mayer, Salovey, Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. Adherence to medications was measured by self-report and defined as less than 10% missed doses of medications. Eighty-two participants were recruited from an urban hospital-based HIV clinic. Pearson's r was used to analyze the data for significance, and no correlation was reported. This data set was not large enough to prove significance, statistically, of the research question. However, an unexpected result of this study was that the overall EI scores for this particular population were markedly lower than the test norms. Further study would be warranted and recommended to explore El measurement in people at risk for HIV disease or in those who have the disease to further understand the impact of emotions and EI in this specific population.",

    "abstract": "Abel and Kruger (2005) reported a negative association of educational attainment and suicide rate across the United States. Given strong links between intelligence and educational attainment, this appears to be inconsistent with positive associations of intelligence and suicide rate reported in several other geographical studies. However, the apparent inconsistencies may reflect interstate migration within the U.S. adult population. Testing this hypothesis showed that interstate migration was more strongly related to state suicide rates than educational attainment. Thus, the different results obtained by Abel and Kruger could reflect migration effects, which for the U.S. might render adult-age indicators of educational attainment inappropriate to reflect regional variation in intelligence by place of birth.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) techniques are used routinely by computational chemists in drug discovery and development to analyze datasets of compounds. Quantitative numerical methods like Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been used on QSAR to establish correlations between molecular properties and bioactivity. However, ANN may be advantageous over PLS because it considers the interrelations of the modeled variables. This study focused on the HIV-1 Protease (HIV-1 Pr) inhibitors belonging to the peptidomimetic class of compounds. The main objective was to select molecular descriptors with the best predictive value for antiviral potency (Ki). PLS and ANN were used to predict Ki activity of HIV-1 Pr inhibitors and the results were compared. To address the issue of dimensionality reduction, Genetic Algorithms (GA) were used for variable selection and their performance was compared against that of ANN. Finally, the structure of the optimum ANN achieving the highest Pearson's-R coefficient was determined. On the basis of Pearson's-R, PLS and ANN were compared to determine which exhibits maximum performance. Training and validation of models was performed on 15 random split sets of the master dataset consisted of 231 compounds. For each compound 192 molecular descriptors were considered. The molecular structure and constant of inhibition (Ki) were selected from the NIAID database. Study findings suggested that non-covalent interactions such as hydrophobicity, shape and hydrogen bonding describe well the antiviral activity of the HIV-1 Pr compounds. The significance of lipophilicity and relationship to HIV-1 associated hyperlipidemia and lipodystrophy syndrome warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the relationship between symptoms of psychopathology and cognitive functioning in clients completing comprehensive psychoeducational assessments at a university-based outpatient mental health clinic. Seventy clients (36 women, 34 men, mean age=28.8) completed the Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition (WMS-III), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III), and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Second Edition (MMPI-2). Partial correlations between the MMPI-2 clinical scales, WMS-III Index scores, WAIS-III Index scores, and WAIS-III IQ scores were not significant. Memory and Intelligence scores for clients with comorbid symptoms of depression and anxiety were comparable to scores for clients without comorbid symptomatology. Psychopathology factors accounted for 22% of the variance in the WAIS-III Full Scale IQ and 6.5% of the variance in the WMS-III General Memory Index. The results suggest that psychopathology as measured by the MMPI-2 may be minimally associated with intelligence and memory test performance in adults seen for psychoeducational assessment.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the long-term efficacy and tolerability of risperidone in the treatment of children and adolescents with disruptive behavior disorder (DBD) and below-average intelligence (IQ < 84) over a cumulative period of 2 years.\nWe followed 48 patients (6-15 years of age), who had previously completed a 1- year open-label study of risperidone, for an additional year of treatment. Efficacy was assessed using the conduct problem subscale of the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (N-CBRF) as a primary outcome measure; other N-CBRF subscales, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) of severity were secondary efficacy measures. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.\nOf the 48 patients enrolled in this extension study, 33 (69%) completed the trial. The efficacy benefits from the original study were maintained over the course of the extension study. Safety and tolerability were good overall, with the number of adverse events (AEs) decreasing in the extension trial, compared to the original trial. Six patients (13%) discontinued owing to AEs. Weight gain observed in the original trial stabilized during this extension trial. Cognitive testing demonstrated small, but significant, improvements in cognitive ability.\nRisperidone is safe and effective in treating DBDs in children over a cumulative period of 2 years.",

    "abstract": "The term ''emotional intelligence'' (EI) has become very popular in the business world and has recently infiltrated veterinary medical education. The term purports to encompass those qualities and skills that are not measured by IQ tests but do play an important role in achieving success in life. Veterinary medical educators often incorporate these in a category called ''non-technical competencies'' (which includes, for example, communication skills) and acknowledge that veterinarians need more training in this area in order to be successful. Although EI looks promising as a means for teaching these non-technical competencies to students and practitioners, there are some challenges to its application. To begin with, there are three competing models of EI that differ in definition and measuring instruments. Although some research has suggested that high EI is associated with success in school and in business, there are no studies directly correlating high EI with greater success in the veterinary profession. Nor have any studies confirmed that increasing a student's EI will improve eventual outcomes for that student. It is important that educators approach the implementation of new techniques and concepts for teaching non-technical competencies the same way they would approach teaching a new surgical technique or drug therapy. EI is an intriguing and promising construct and deserves dedicated research to assess its relevance to veterinary medical education. There are opportunities to investigate EI using case control studies that will either confirm or discredit the benefits of incorporating EI into the veterinary curriculum. Implementing EI training without assessment risks wasting limited resources and alienating students.",

    "abstract": "With the development of computing technology, numerical models are often employed to simulate flow and water quality processes in coastal environments. However, the emphasis has conventionally been placed on algorithmic procedures to solve specific problems. These numerical models, being insufficiently user-friendly, lack knowledge transfers in model interpretation. This results in significant constraints on model uses and large gaps between model developers and practitioners. It is a difficult task for novice application users to select an appropriate numerical model. It is desirable to incorporate the existing heuristic knowledge about model manipulation and to furnish intelligent manipulation of calibration parameters. The advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) during the past decade rendered it possible to integrate the technologies into numerical modelling systems in order to bridge the gaps. The objective of this paper is to review the current state-of-the-art of the integration of AI into water quality modelling. Algorithms and methods studied include knowledge-based system, genetic algorithm, artificial neural network, and fuzzy inference system. These techniques can contribute to the integrated model in different aspects and may not be mutually exclusive to one another. Some future directions for further development and their potentials are explored and presented.",

    "abstract": "Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) has been associated with poor cognitive development in children. We performed this research to establish the association between ELBW and the influence of biological and socioeconomic factors in the intelligence quotient (IQ) score in school-age children.\nThis study comprised 184 children with mean and standard deviation of 6.9 +/- 0.8 years of age. The children were divided into four groups based on their birth weight as follows: group A (n = 25), < or =1000 g; group B (n = 52), 1001-1500 g; group C (n = 66), 1501-2500 g; and group D (n = 41), > or =2501 g. The Stanford-Binet after the Terman-Merril Intelligence Scale was used to determine IQ scores.\nMean and standard deviation (SD) of IQ values were 95.3 +/- 11.3 for group A, 103.1 +/- 14.4 for group B, 105.1 +/- 12.3 for group C, and 106.8 +/- 11.7 for group D (p = 0.003). Frequencies of children with scores below normal distribution were the following: 28% in group A; 10% in group B; 15% in group C, and 5% in group D (chi(2) = 0.04). Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and parental education were associated with lower IQ scores (p <0.05).\nIQ scores of children born with ELBW were significantly lower when compared to children born with a higher birth weight. Additional studies are important to determine whether these neurodevelopmental delays persist into adulthood, and whether there are additional factors associated with catch-up and recovery.",

    "abstract": "Previous factor analytic studies of the WAIS, WAIS-R and WAIS-III used standardization samples, (representing the general population), clinical populations (e.g. psychiatric) and 'non-clinical' groups (e.g. older adults). These studies endorsed the reliability of the scales in such samples and supported theoretical models of intelligence. The WAIS-III (1997) includes four Indexes based on factor analysis, which provide clinically useful information to practitioners, but have not been validated in a low IQ population. However, the WAIS-III is often administered to individuals with suspected or proven low IQ, as it offers service providers, legislators and the Department of Health with a reliable measure of IQ. The aim of this study was to investigate the factor structure of the WAIS-III in a low IQ sample.\nWAIS-III data was collected from assessments carried out in routine clinical practice from individuals with a full scale IQ of 74 or below (n=105). The data were subjected to factor analysis, using two types of factor analysis: principal axis factoring and principal components analysis. Orthogonal and oblique rotations were applied to the analyses.\nOnly one robust solution could be extracted. This contained two factors, analogous to traditional verbal and performance sub-scales.\nThis study does not support the four-factor solution which underlies WAIS-III index scores in a low IQ population.",

    "abstract": "We studied thirty-one children with hemiplegia to elucidate the relationship of intelligence, the laterality of a lesion, and epilepsy, in these children. We investigated the influences of the age at the onset of the seizures, the number of anti-convulsants, and the duration of medication, on the DQ/FIQ. The results indicated a significantly higher DQ/FIQ and VIQ for right hemiplegic children than for left hemiplegic children. But the PIQ of the patients with either a left or right hemiplegia was not significantly different. A significantly higher DQ/FIQ, VIQ, and PIQ was also revealed for the children without epilepsy. In addition, there was also a tendency that the DQ/FIQ of children who suffered from epilepsy before the age of one year was lower than that of children who suffered from epilepsy after the age of one year. The present results provide evidence which supports the crowding hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Iron supplements are often prescribed during pregnancy despite the lack of intervention trials that have assessed the effects of supplementation in pregnancy on childhood development.\nThe objective was to determine whether iron supplementation during pregnancy influences childhood intelligence quotient (IQ) in an industrialized country.\nPregnant women (n = 430) were randomly allocated to receive iron (20 mg/d) or placebo from 20 wk gestation until delivery, and the women and their children were followed up over the long term (4 y). Seventy percent of these families participated in the follow-up. The proportion of women with iron deficiency anemia at the end of pregnancy was 1% (2 of 146) in the iron group and 11% (15 of 141) in the placebo group. The primary outcome was the IQ of the children at 4 y of age, as assessed by the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale. Secondary outcomes included child behavior and the general health of the mothers.\nThe mean IQ was not significantly different (P = 0.980) between the children of the iron-supplemented mothers (109 +/- 11; n = 153) and the children of the mothers in the placebo group (109 +/- 11; n = 149). However, the percentage of children with an abnormal behavior score was higher in the iron group (24 of 151, or 16%) than in the placebo group (12 of 149, or 8%); the relative risk was 1.97 (95% CI: 1.03, 3.80; P = 0.037). There was no significant difference in the health of the mothers between groups, as assessed by the SF-36 Health Survey.\nPrenatal iron supplementation that reduces the incidence of iron deficiency anemia from 11% to 1% has no effect on the IQ of the offspring at 4 y of age.",

    "abstract": "A significant difficulty that pathologists encounter in arriving at a correct diagnosis is related to the way information from various sources is processed and assimilated in context.\nThese issues are addressed by the science of cognitive psychology. Although cognitive biases are the focus of a number of studies on medical decision making, few if any focus on the visual sciences.\nA recent publication authored by Richards Heuer, Jr, The Psychology of Intelligence Analysis, directly addresses many of the cognitive biases faced by neuropathologists and anatomic pathologists in general. These biases include visual anticipation, first impression, and established mindsets and subconsciously influence our critical decision-making processes.\nThe book points out that while biases are an inherent property of cognition, the influence of such biases can be recognized and the effects blunted.",

The sample was made up of 184 university students (38 men and 146 women). El was evaluated by the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (Salovey, Mayer, Goldman, Turvey, and Palfai, 1995), which evaluates the three dimensions (Attention, Clarity, and Mood Repair). Anxiety was evaluated with the Trait Anxiety Questionnaire (Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, and Jacobs, 1983) and depression with the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Rush, Shaw, and Emery, 1979). Mental, social, and physical health were evaluated with the SF-12 Health Survey (Ware, Kosinski, and Keller, 1996). Results showed that high Emotional Attention was positively and significantly related to high anxiety, depression, and to low levels of Role Emotional, Social Functioning, and Mental Health. However, high levels of emotional Clarity and Mood Repair were related to low levels of anxiety and depression, high Role Physical, Social Functioning, Mental Health, Vitality, and General Health. This study confirmed the predictive value of Attention, Clarity and Mood Repair regarding the levels of anxiety, depression, and areas related to mental, social, and physical health in university students.",

    "abstract": "In recent years a number of algorithms for cardiovascular risk assessment has been proposed to the medical community. These algorithms consider a number of variables and express their results as the percentage risk of developing a major fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular event in the following 10 to 20 years\nThe author has identified three major pitfalls of these algorithms, linked to the limitation of the classical statistical approach in dealing with this kind of non linear and complex information. The pitfalls are the inability to capture the disease complexity, the inability to capture process dynamics, and the wide confidence interval of individual risk assessment. Artificial Intelligence tools can provide potential advantage in trying to overcome these limitations. The theoretical background and some application examples related to artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic have been reviewed and discussed.\nThe use of predictive algorithms to assess individual absolute risk of cardiovascular future events is currently hampered by methodological and mathematical flaws. The use of newer approaches, such as fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks, linked to artificial intelligence, seems to better address both the challenge of increasing complexity resulting from a correlation between predisposing factors, data on the occurrence of cardiovascular events, and the prediction of future events on an individual level.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the relationships of visuomotor constructs as measured by the Bender-Gestalt II with the subtests of the WISC-III. A factor analysis included the standardized Copy and Recall scores of the Bender-Gestalt II and subtest scores of the WISC-III. The Copy score was predicted to load on measures of visual and spatial thinking and the Recall score on a short-term memory factor. The results of a principal components analysis suggest a four-factor solution with the Bender-Gestalt II Copy score loading on a visual and spatial thinking factor primarily with WISC-III Perceptual Organization subtests. The Recall score loaded on a visual and spatial thinking factor as well as a short-term memory factor with the WISC-III Digit Span subtest. The results suggest the Bender-Gestalt II Copy subtest shared commonality with the visual and spatial tasks given the similarity in the visuomotor demands of each test and was less influenced by processing speed or cultural knowledge than other tests on the visual and spatial thinking factor. Also, results suggest Bender-Gestalt II Recall measures elements of both visual and spatial thinking as well as aspects of short-term memory and memory retrieval. Clinical guidelines for co-administration and underlying processing demands are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine whether the established positive association between birth weight and childhood psychometric intelligence is seen within singleton sibling pairs from the same family as well as between nonsiblings.\nWe examined the association of intrauterine growth (measured as birth weight standardized for gender and gestational age) with psychometric intelligence (measured using the Moray House picture test) at 7 years old in a birth cohort of 9792 individuals who were singleton births occurring in Aberdeen, Scotland, between 1950 and 1956. We further compared this association within siblings with that between nonsiblings in the cohort; this family-based analysis included 1645 sibling pairs (N = 3290 individuals).\nThere was a positive linear association between birth weight and childhood psychometric intelligence at age 7 in the whole cohort, which remained with adjustment for a range of potential confounding factors. A one standard deviation increase in birth weight for gestational age z score was associated with a greater intelligence score in a regression model adjusting for sex, year of birth, paternal social class, maternal height, age, gravidity, and birth outside of marriage. The mean age difference between the siblings within each family pair was 2.2 years. In the family-based analysis there was no strong association between birth weight for gestation age z score and intelligence within sibling pairs from the same family, but there was a positive association between nonsiblings; the difference in these effects being unlikely to be due to chance. With additional adjustment for social class, maternal height, age, gravidity, and birth outside of marriage, the within-sibling pair effect was unaltered and the nonsibling effect attenuated, although an apparently robust positive association remained. In these adjusted analyses there was still evidence that the within-sibling effect differed from that between nonsiblings. We found no evidence that the main effects or the family-based analyses differed between males and females.\nOur family-based analyses are consistent with one previous large family-based study that included >2500 sibling pairs and found no within-sibling-pairs association between birth weight and childhood intelligence, but did not make a direct statistical comparison between the within-sibling-pairs association and that between nonsiblings. In a second large study that included only sibling pairs of the same sex, in males there was a within-sibling-pairs association between birth weight and childhood intelligence. However, for females there was no within-sibling-pairs association. The authors commented that this sex difference was puzzling and needed replication. Although we had less power than this earlier study to assess sex differences, the point estimates and statistical tests in our study suggested that there was no sex difference.\nThe lack of any association within sibling pairs from the same family suggests that the association between birth weight and childhood intelligence in the general population of singletons is largely explained by fixed family factors that are closely matched in siblings of a similar age. These factors include family socioeconomic characteristics, parental education and intelligence, genetic factors and fixed maternal factors, such as her behaviors, size, and metabolic and cardiovascular health that are constant from one pregnancy to the next and could therefore affect her offspring growth and intelligence across all pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Nurse's spiritual well-being may assure a positive attitude toward spiritual care, and assist patients in overcoming spiritual distress. Spirituality is often related to one's belief system. Spirituality on the part of nurses is yet largely unheard of in a society with materialism which is one of the most destructive belief systems on the world.\nThe objective of the study was to explore the profile of spiritual intelligence among nurses, and to examine the effect of religions on nurses' spiritual intelligence in China.\nThis is a cross-sectional descriptive and inferential designed study.\nThe study was carried out in a medical center in China. Subjects were widely distributed, throughout seven provinces, with 16 hospital settings.\nA total of 130 registered hospital nurses, who were taking part in a 3-day, national nursing quality conference held by the target medical center in China, were recruited by convenience sampling.\nWolman's (2001) four-point Likert-type Psycho-Matrix Spirituality Inventroy (PSI) was distributed collaboratively during the period of the conference. Upon receiving oral approval from nursing administrators, the author ensured that subjects' responses would remain confidential and that filling out the questionnaire was to be construed as willingness to participate in this study.\n1. The majority of nurses (90%) tended to experience numerous instances of physical emotional pain and suffering throughout life. 2. Among the 130 subjects, only seven nurses clearly specified their religions, and religious beliefs accounted for most of the variance in the criterion variable in the study.\nExploring nurses' spiritual profiles, especially for those who seem to be unfamiliar with spiritual matters, is a starting point on the journey to delivering spiritual care. Chinese nurses' spiritual intelligence is only to be excavated. The study draws attention to the diverse culture of the nurses' concepts of spirituality, which is fundamental to the delivery of truly holistic care of humans in a multi-faith society.",

    "abstract": "Superior cognitive performance can be viewed from an intelligence perspective, emphasising general properties of the human information processing system (such as mental speed and working memory), and from an expertise perspective, highlighting the indispensable role of elaborated domain-specific knowledge and acquired skills. In exploring its neurophysiological basis, recent research has provided considerable evidence of the neural efficiency hypothesis of intelligence, indicating lower and more focussed brain activation in brighter individuals. The present EEG study investigates the impacts of intelligence and expertise on cognitive performance and the accompanying cortical activation patterns in the domain of tournament chess. Forty-seven tournament chess players of varying intelligence and expertise level worked on tasks drawing on mental speed, memory, and reasoning. Half of the tasks were representative for chess, while the other half was not. The cortical activation was quantified by means of event-related desynchronisation (ERD) in the upper alpha band. Independent effects of expertise and intelligence emerged at both, the performance and the neurophysiological level. Brighter participants performed better than less intelligent ones which was associated with more efficient brain functioning (lower ERD) across all tasks. Additionally, a high expertise level was beneficial for good task performance but exerted a topographically differentiated influence on the cortical activation patterns. The findings suggest that superior cognitive performance and the underlying cortical activation are not only a function of knowledge and domain-specific competences but also of the general efficiency of the information processing system.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports a new capillary zone electrophoresis method for the simultaneous chiral determination of the enantiomers of N,N-dimethylamphetamine (DMA), methamphetamine (MA), ephedrine (E), pseudoephedrine (PE) and methylephedrine (Me-E). In this study, a number of electophoretic parameters were examined and optimized including the choice of chiral selectors, the use of short-chain tetraalkylammonium cations, the effect of chiral selector concentration, buffer concentration, applied voltage and capillary temperature. Heptakis(2,6-di-O-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (DM-beta-CD) and tetrabutylammonium (TBA) being the best chiral selector and buffer cation, respectively, the optimized electrophoretic conditions were found to be: 20 mM DM-beta-CD, 50 mM TBAPO(4) at pH 2.5, applied voltage at 30 kV and temperature at 25 degrees C. Under the optimized conditions, all analytes were well separated with resolution factors between 3.3 and 24.0 achieved. Using phentermine as an internal standard, the intra-day (n=8) precisions for the relative migration times and peak areas of all analytes were below 1.09%, while the inter-day precisions (n=12, 6 days) for the relative migration times and peak areas of all analytes were under 3.77%. This method has been applied to the measurement of the enantiomeric purities of the seized DMA samples. The result of the measurement could provide important clues about the possible synthetic pathways of these samples.",

The subjects were 64 university students who completed the short form of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-30), the Social Support Questionnaire, and the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List (MAACL). The results show that Social Support is high and significantly related with both Mood Repair, on one hand, and more Positive Affects and Sensation Seeking, on the other. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that social support can be considered, somehow, as a way of mood repair; and thus not surprisingly is also associated with more Positive Affects and Sensation Seeking.",

A corollary deducible from this assertion is that intelligence and suicide mortality should be positively related. The present study tested de Catanzaro's corollary within a country. Using district-level IQ data of the entire non-institutionalized Austrian male year-of-birth cohort of 1969 who survived up to compulsory military conscription, including IQ testing in 1987 (n = 55474), the subsequent (1987-2001) district-level cohort loss due to suicide mortality was investigated. Across 99 Austrian districts, the regional IQ was weakly but statistically significantly, positively related to the regional standardized suicide rate as well as to the regional percentage of mortality due to suicide in this very cohort, when these relations were controlled for likely confounders (male divorce and unemployment rates and male net income), but not statistically reliable without these controls. It is argued that the most parsimonious interpretation of these aggregate-level findings remains that intelligence level and suicide mortality are positively related.",

    "abstract": "This target article considers the relation of fluid cognitive functioning to general intelligence. A neurobiological model differentiating working memory/executive function cognitive processes of the prefrontal cortex from aspects of psychometrically defined general intelligence is presented. Work examining the rise in mean intelligence-test performance between normative cohorts, the neuropsychology and neuroscience of cognitive function in typically and atypically developing human populations, and stress, brain development, and corticolimbic connectivity in human and nonhuman animal models is reviewed and found to provide evidence of mechanisms through which early experience affects the development of an aspect of cognition closely related to, but distinct from, general intelligence. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of emotion in fluid cognition and on research indicating fluid cognitive deficits associated with early hippocampal pathology and with dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stress-response system. Findings are seen to be consistent with the idea of an independent fluid cognitive construct and to assist with the interpretation of findings from the study of early compensatory education for children facing psychosocial adversity and from behavior genetic research on intelligence. It is concluded that ongoing development of neurobiologically grounded measures of fluid cognitive skills appropriate for young children will play a key role in understanding early mental development and the adaptive success to which it is related, particularly for young children facing social and economic disadvantage. Specifically, in the evaluation of the efficacy of compensatory education efforts such as Head Start and the readiness for school of children from diverse backgrounds, it is important to distinguish fluid cognition from psychometrically defined general intelligence.",

    "abstract": "The current study examined the contributions of general slowing and frontal decline to age differences in fluid intelligence. Participants aged 20-89 years completed Block Design, Matrix Reasoning, simple reaction time, choice reaction time, Wisconsin Card Sorting, and Tower of London tasks. Age-related declines in fluid intelligence, speed of processing, and frontal function were observed. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that the processing speed and frontal function measures accounted for significant variance in fluid intelligence performance, but there was also a residual effect of age after controlling for each variable individually as well as both variables. An additional analysis showed that the variance in fluid intelligence that was attributable to processing speed was not fully shared with the variance attributable to frontal function. These findings suggest that the age-related decline in fluid intelligence is due to general slowing and frontal decline, as well as other unidentified factors.",

    "abstract": "According to J. B. Carroll's (1993) 3-stratum theory, performance on any subtest reflects a mixture of both 2nd-order and 1st-order factors. To disentangle these influences, variance explained by the general factor should be extracted first. The 1st-order factors are then residualized, leaving them orthogonal to the general factor and each other. When these methods were applied to the WISC-IV standardization sample, the general factor accounted for the greatest amount of common (71.3%) and total (38.3%) variance. The largest contribution by a first-order factor was 6.5% of total variance. It was recommended that interpretation of the WISC-IV not discount the strong general factor.",

    "abstract": "The study and treatment of psychiatric disorders is made difficult by the fact that patients with identical symptoms often differ markedly in their clinical features and presumably in their etiology. A principal aim of genetic research is to provide new information that can resolve such clinical heterogeneity and that can be incorporated into diagnostic practice.\nTo test the hypothesis that the DRD4 seven-repeat allele and DAT1 ten-repeat allele would prove useful in identifying a subset of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who have compromised intellectual functions.\nLongitudinal epidemiologic investigation of 2 independent birth cohorts.\nBritain and New Zealand.\nThe first cohort was born in Britain in 1994-1995 and includes 2232 children; the second cohort was born in New Zealand in 1972-1973 and includes 1037 children.\nEvaluation of ADHD, IQ, and adult psychosocial adjustment.\nWe present replicated evidence that polymorphisms in the DRD4 and DAT1 genes were associated with variation in intellectual functioning among children diagnosed as having ADHD, apart from severity of their symptoms. We further show longitudinal evidence that these polymorphisms predicted which children with ADHD were at greatest risk for poor adult prognosis.\nThe findings indicate that genetic information of this nature may prove useful for etiology-based psychiatric nosologies.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the potential relationship between social behavior (aggression, dominance, and affiliation) and testosterone, androstenedione, and DHEA measurements in 5-year-old children while also analyzing the moderating effect of IQ on the hormone-behavior relationship. 129 healthy normal Iberian children (60 boys and 69 girls) were videotaped in free play interactions in the school playground. Their behavior was then evaluated with particular emphasis on aggression, government, and affiliation. Testosterone, androstenedione, and DHEA levels were measured using an enzyme immunoassay technique in saliva samples. A test (K-BIT) which provides an IQ measurement for children was also administered to subjects. The correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship between the behavioral factor of Provocation and androstenedione in boys, and a regression analysis indicated that this relationship was moderated in a positive direction by the subject's intelligence. In girls, we observed a positive relationship between testosterone and Affectivity, with this relationship being moderated in a negative direction by intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Comparative psychologists interested in the evolution of intelligence have focused their attention on social primates, whereas birds tend to be used as models of associative learning. However, corvids and parrots, which have forebrains relatively the same size as apes, live in complex social groups and have a long developmental period before becoming independent, have demonstrated ape-like intelligence. Although, ornithologists have documented thousands of hours observing birds in their natural habitat, they have focused their attention on avian behaviour and ecology, rather than intelligence. This review discusses recent studies of avian cognition contrasting two different approaches; the anthropocentric approach and the adaptive specialization approach. It is argued that the most productive method is to combine the two approaches. This is discussed with respects to recent investigations of two supposedly unique aspects of human cognition; episodic memory and theory of mind. In reviewing the evidence for avian intelligence, corvids and parrots appear to be cognitively superior to other birds and in many cases even apes. This suggests that complex cognition has evolved in species with very different brains through a process of convergent evolution rather than shared ancestry, although the notion that birds and mammals may share common neural connectivity patterns is discussed.",

Comparison of associations within sibling pairs of the same family to associations between different families in 643 sibling pairs (1286 individuals) who are participants in the main cohort.\nChildhood intelligence (age 7 years) and educational attainment were both inversely associated with adult BMI (mean age 48 years): the sex- and age-adjusted mean change in adult BMI per s.d. of intelligence was -0.35 kg/m(2) (95% CI: -0.49, -0.21 kg/m(2)) and per unit increase in educational category (seven categories) was -0.28 kg/m(2) (95% CI: -0.34, -0.22). On adjustment for education the association between childhood intelligence and adult BMI attenuated to the null (-0.03 kg/m(2) (-0.19, 0.13 kg/m(2))); other potential confounding or mediating factors had little or only modest effects on this association. The association between education and adult BMI was not affected by adjustment for childhood intelligence or other potential covariates. The within sibling-pair effect of education on adult BMI (-0.06 kg/m(2) (95% CI: -0.26, 0.14)) was weaker than the effect between different families (-0.37 kg/m(2) (95%CI: -0.58, -0.17)), P-value for difference of within sibling and between family effect=0.03.\nThe association of childhood intelligence with adult BMI is attenuated to the null on adjustment for educational attainment, whereas the association of educational attainment with adult BMI appears to be independent of childhood intelligence and other measured covariates. However, our family analyses suggest that fixed family and neighbourhood factors, which are closely matched in siblings of a similar age, explain much of the association between greater educational attainment and lower adult BMI.",

    "abstract": "The purposes of the study included: (1) defining the profile of nurses' spiritual intelligence; (2) examining the relationship between nurses' demographic characteristics and spiritual intelligence; and (3) exploring the mode of nurses' spiritual intelligence and related factors, among nurses in Taiwan. A cross-sectional descriptive study was designed and administered to 299 hospital registered nurses, who were distributed throughout metropolitan Taipei. Wolman's (2001) PsychoMatrix Spirituality Inventory, a 4-point scaled, self-reported, 49-item questionnaire covering seven spiritual factors (divinity, mindfulness, extrasensory perception, community, intellectuality, trauma, and childhood spirituality) was used to measure nurses' spiritual intelligence. Results showed that nurses' spiritual intelligence was centralized in a moderate degree, while trauma and childhood spirituality were either moderate or high. Age and childhood spirituality were the most significant variables affecting nurses' spiritual intelligence, accounting for 61.4% of the variance in nurses' spiritual intelligence. This study may contribute to a better understanding of the spiritual intelligence profile of nurses and may also help facilitate a program for nurses' spiritual development as well as improve the quality of spiritual care.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has shown evidence for sex differences in the neuroanatomical bases for intelligence in adults. Possible differences in the neuroanatomical correlates of intelligence and their developmental trajectories between boys and girls were investigated using functional MRI (fMRI). A large cohort of over 300 children, ages 5-18, performed the semantic processing task of silent verb generation. Regions were found in the left hemisphere exhibiting positive correlations of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activation with IQ, including the middle temporal gyrus, prefrontal cortex (Broca's area), medial frontal gyrus, precuneus, and cingulate gyrus, while the superior temporal gyrus in the right hemisphere displayed a negative correlation of BOLD activation with IQ. Significant sex-X-IQ and sex-X-IQ-X-age interaction effects were also seen in the left middle temporal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus. Using a data-driven analysis procedure, a sex-X-IQ-X-age interaction was also demonstrated in the functional connectivity between regions in the left hemisphere, parameterized as a weighted sum of pairwise covariances between fMRI time courses. While young girls (<13 years) exhibited no correlation of connectivity with intelligence, older girls (>13 years) demonstrated a positive association of functional connectivity with intelligence. Boys, however, demonstrated the opposite developmental trajectory, from a positive association of connectivity with intelligence in young boys (ages <9 years), to a negative association in older boys (ages >13 years). Our results provide evidence for disparate neuroanatomical trajectories underlying intelligence in boys and girls.",

    "abstract": "Prior research has demonstrated that the P300 response may be related to neuropsychological functioning in nonclinical samples. However, the nature of this relation is unclear, and its characteristics in schizophrenia are unexplored. We assessed estimated IQ, neuropsychological tests that assess components of executive functioning, and the P300 component of the event-related brain potential elicited by auditory and visual oddball paradigms in individuals with and without schizophrenia. We observed modest relations between P300 indices and neuropsychological tests purported to assess aspects of executive functioning in both diagnostic groups. Furthermore, multiple regression analyses revealed that whereas control participants with higher estimated IQs demonstrated larger P3 amplitudes to attended auditory targets, the opposite relation appeared evident in schizophrenic participants when variance due to Trailmaking A or a continuous performance task was held constant. Additionally, control participants with higher estimated IQs demonstrated shorter P3 latencies to attended visual targets whereas schizophrenic participants did not when variance due to the Tower of London was held constant. These results suggest diagnostic group differences in the association between P300 and IQ and indicate that investigations designed to explore P300-IQ relations should include measures of executive functioning in their models.",

    "abstract": "This report deals with the discussion of the findings obtained from the application of two computational intelligence methodologies for the detection of microcalcifications in screening mammography data. Genetic programming and inductive machine learning have been applied, in order to produce meaningful diagnostic rules for the medical staff. The data used in the experiments correspond to information acquired from two images of each breast of the patient, along with some associated patient information such as the age at time of study. Similar datasets have been previously used in an attempt to facilitate the development of computer algorithms to aid screening. Experienced screening radiologists have double-read the screening mammograms, they have weighted the malignancy ratings and averaged out the levels of suspiciousness assigned to each finding in the screenings. The diagnostic rules which were obtained from both genetic programming and machine learning have been evaluated in detail and then analyzed and discussed by collaborative medical experts, in parallel to findings from related literature. Results seem encouraging for further use and analysis by medical staff specializing in screening mammography.",

Using May Grunvald-Giemsa-stained smears taken by fine needle aspiration (FNA) and a custom image analysis system, 25 nuclear features describing the size, shape and texture of the nuclei were measured in each case. A statistical pre-processing of features revealed that only 4 of the 25 features are important when discriminating benign from malignant thyroid lesions, which were transformed and fed to four classifiers for subsequent analysis. The cases were divided into one set used for the training of classifiers, a second set used as the test set, and the remaining cases with no clear classification formed an ambiguous test set. Classification was performed at the nuclear and patient level. The technique described in this study produced encouraging results and promises to be a helpful tool in the daily cytological laboratory routine.",

Individual tests can be classified according to the degree to which they involve g. Here, regional brain volumes associated with g are investigated by means of structural magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry. First, individual differences in the amount of regional gray matter volumes across the entire brain were correlated with eight cognitive tests showing distinguishable g-involvement. Results show that increasing g-involvement of individual tests was associated with increased gray matter volume throughout the brain. Second, it is shown that two prototypical measures of verbal and non-verbal g (i.e., vocabulary and block design) correlate with the amount of regional gray matter across frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, suggesting that the general factor of intelligence relates to areas distributed across the brain as opposed to the view that g derives exclusively from the frontal lobes.",

    "abstract": "The recent SARS epidemic has renewed widespread concerns about the global transmission of infectious diseases. In this commentary, we explore novel approaches to global infectious disease surveillance through a focus on an important Canadian contribution to the area--the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN). GPHIN is a cutting-edge initiative that draws on the capacity of the Internet and newly available 24/7 global news coverage of health events to create a unique form of early warning outbreak detection. This commentary outlines the operation and development of GPHIN and compares it to ProMED-mail, another Internet-based approach to global health surveillance. We argue that GPHIN has created an important shift in the relationship of public health and news information. By exiting the pyramid of official reporting, GPHIN has created a new monitoring technique that has disrupted national boundaries of outbreak notification, while creating new possibilities for global outbreak response. By incorporating news within the emerging apparatus of global infectious disease surveillance, GPHIN has effectively responded to the global media's challenge to official country reporting of outbreak and enhanced the effectiveness and credibility of international public health.\nL\u2019\u00e9pid\u00e9mie r\u00e9cente de SRAS a renouvel\u00e9 la crainte g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e que des maladies infectieuses ne se propagent dans le monde entier. Dans le pr\u00e9sent commentaire, nous analysons de nouvelles approches de surveillance mondiale des maladies infectieuses par le biais d\u2019un important outil canadien dans ce domaine: le R\u00e9seau d\u2019information sur la sant\u00e9 mondiale (RISM). Ce r\u00e9seau est une initiative d\u2019avant-garde qui mise sur la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019Internet et sur la nouvelle possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une couverture mondiale en temps r\u00e9el de l\u2019actualit\u00e9 du domaine de la sant\u00e9 pour cr\u00e9er un syst\u00e8me d\u2019alerte rapide en cas de flamb\u00e9e \u00e9pid\u00e9mique. Nous d\u00e9crivons ici le fonctionnement et l\u2019\u00e9volution du RISM, que nous comparons \u00e0 ProMED-mail, un autre outil en ligne de surveillance mondiale de la sant\u00e9. Nous faisons valoir que le RISM a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause d\u2019un changement important dans la relation entre la sant\u00e9 publique et l\u2019actualit\u00e9. En contournant la hi\u00e9rarchie de notification officielle, le RISM a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une nouvelle technique de surveillance qui a perturb\u00e9 les fronti\u00e8res nationales de notification des \u00e9pid\u00e9mies tout en ouvrant de nouvelles possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019intervention mondiale en cas de flamb\u00e9e. En int\u00e9grant l\u2019actualit\u00e9 dans le nouvel appareil de surveillance mondiale des maladies infectieuses, le RISM a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 relever le d\u00e9fi lanc\u00e9 par les m\u00e9dias aux organes nationaux de notification officielle des \u00e9pid\u00e9mies, tout en am\u00e9liorant l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la sant\u00e9 publique internationale.",

    "abstract": "Male provisioning ability may have evolved as a \"good dad\" indicator through sexual selection, whereas male creativity may have evolved partly as a \"good genes\" indicator. If so, women near peak fertility (midcycle) should prefer creativity over wealth, especially in short-term mating. Forty-one normally cycling women read vignettes describing creative but poor men vs. uncreative but rich men. Women's estimated fertility predicted their short-term (but not long-term) preference for creativity over wealth, in both their desirability ratings of individual men (r=.40, p<.01) and their forced-choice decisions between men (r=.46, p<.01). These preliminary results are consistent with the view that creativity evolved at least partly as a good genes indicator through mate choice.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with opioid dependence have cognitive deficits during abuse period in attention, working memory, episodic memory, and executive function. After protracted abstinence consistent cognitive deficit has been found only in executive function. However, few studies have explored cognitive function during first weeks of abstinence. The purpose of this study was to study cognitive function of individuals with opioid dependence during early abstinence. It was hypothesized that cognitive deficits are pronounced immediately after peak withdrawal symptoms have passed and then partially recover.\nFifteen patients with opioid dependence and fifteen controls matched for, age, gender, and verbal intelligence were tested with a cognitive test battery When patients performed worse than controls correlations between cognitive performance and days of withdrawal, duration of opioid abuse, duration of any substance abuse, or opioid withdrawal symptom inventory score (Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale) were analyzed.\nEarly abstinent opioid dependent patients performed statistically significantly worse than controls in tests measuring complex working memory, executive function, and fluid intelligence. Their complex working memory and fluid intelligence performances correlated statistically significantly with days of withdrawal.\nThe results indicate a rather general neurocognitive deficit in higher order cognition. It is suggested that cognitive deficit during early abstinence from opioid dependence is related to withdrawal induced neural dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex and is partly transient.",

    "abstract": "Task-related power changes in the EEG alpha band were analyzed in 31 participants (17 males and 14 females) during performance of two verbal creativity tasks. Participants were confronted with verbal problems that are in need of explanation (insight problems) and utopian situations that will actually never happen. In both tasks they were instructed to generate as many but also as unusual, unique or original ideas as possible. To assess brain responses that come along with highly original ideas, individual responses were divided into more and less original ideas (within each participant). Creative problem solving was generally accompanied by lower levels of cortical arousal (i.e., increases in alpha power from a pre-stimulus reference to an activation interval). Additionally, more original (vs. less original) responses were associated with a stronger task-related alpha synchronization in posterior (particularly centroparietal) cortices. Task-related alpha power changes during creative problem solving were also moderated by verbal IQ and sex.",

    "abstract": "Intellectual disabilities are often associated with bilateral or diffuse morphologic brain damage. The chances of becoming seizure free after focal surgery are therefore considered to be worse in patients with intellectual disabilities. The risk of postoperative cognitive deficits could increase because diffuse brain damage lowers the patient's ability to compensate for surgically induced deficits. Several studies in adult patients have indicated that IQ alone is not a good predictor of postoperative cognitive and seizure outcome. Our study evaluated this subject in children and adolescents.\nPediatric patients with intellectual disabilities (IQ < or = 70), subaverage intelligence (IQ between 71 and 85), or average-range intelligence (IQ > 85) were matched according to several clinical and etiologic criteria to determine the influence of IQ (N = 66).\nNo dependency of seizure outcome, postoperative cognitive development, and behavioral outcome on the IQ level was found. All groups slightly improved in attention while memory functions tended to decrease and executive functions were stable. School placement remained unchanged for the majority of patients. Between 67 and 78% were seizure free 1 year after surgery (Engel outcome class I).\nIQ alone is not a good predictor of postoperative outcome in pediatric patients with epilepsy. As with patients of average-range intelligence, the decision to operate on patients with a low level of intelligence should depend on the results of the presurgical diagnostics. If the results of the neuropsychological examination indicate diffuse functional impairment, this should not hinder further steps, if all other findings are consistent.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has indicated that patients with a family history of schizophrenia show a greater degree of cognitive and neuropsychological impairment than patients without a family history. We examined the neurocognitive performance, using the WAIS-R, of 51 patients with a family history (familial) and 103 patients without a family history (sporadic) to determine if differences exist that may help to explain the heterogeneous neuropsychological profile of the illness. The family history groups did not differ with respect to gender, diagnosis, ethnicity, age, age of onset, education or duration of illness. Multivariate analyses, covarying for age of onset and education, showed the sporadic group performed significantly better than the familial group on the digit symbol and object assembly subtests, with a trend level difference in overall performance IQ score. Additionally, we identified significant gender differences in favor of males for full scale and verbal IQ, the information, digit span, block design, and arithmetic subtests, and at a trend level, the picture assembly subtest. The family history group differences reflect relative dysfunction in visual attention and scanning, visuomotor control, and spatial processing and reasoning. Overall, the results suggest that sporadic patients have better perceptual-organizational skills and faster speed of processing.",

The authors surveyed them to explore the relationship between emotional intelligence and transformational leadership. The authors considered the 80 officials as leaders and the staffers as members. The present results showed that the emotional intelligence of the leaders shared significant variance with self-perceptions and rater-perceptions of transformational leadership. The present results also somewhat support the predictive value of emotional intelligence in antecedent leadership field research.",

    "abstract": "Methods of computational intelligence (CI), especially fuzzy control and neuronal networks, are used for controlling and optimising of wastewater treatment plants. Areas of application are the control of sludge water dosage, of phosphate elimination by optimal precipitant dosage as well as an optimal aeration in the nitrification zone. In two municipal wastewater treatment plants with 60,000 and 12,600 person equivalents the controllers have been installed and optimised and they have been in operation for several years. Results of operation of the plants are presented in comparison to previously used classical control. Performance increased significantly and the outflow values could be kept securely below the government requirements without increase of the energy consumption. Peak loads in the inflow were eliminated in the plant and did not increase outflow concentrations. Results of operation for more than three years clearly show that the CI controller is a cost-efficient method for a sustainable rise of performance in municipal wastewater treatment plants.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate data driven calibration models with neural networks (NNs) are developed for binary (Cu++ and Ca++) and quaternary (K+, Ca++, NO3- and Cl-) ion-selective electrode (ISE) data. The response profiles of ISEs with concentrations are non-linear and sub-Nernstian. This task represents function approximation of multi-variate, multi-response, correlated, non-linear data with unknown noise structure i.e. multi-component calibration/prediction in chemometric parlance. Radial distribution function (RBF) and Fuzzy-ARTMAP-NN models implemented in the software packages, TRAJAN and Professional II, are employed for the calibration. The optimum NN models reported are based on residuals in concentration space. Being a data driven information technology, NN does not require a model, prior- or posterior- distribution of data or noise structure. Missing information, spikes or newer trends in different concentration ranges can be modeled through novelty detection. Two simulated data sets generated from mathematical functions are modeled as a function of number of data points and network parameters like number of neurons and nearest neighbors. The success of RBF and Fuzzy-ARTMAP-NNs to develop adequate calibration models for experimental data and function approximation models for more complex simulated data sets ensures AI2 (artificial intelligence, 2nd generation) as a promising technology in quantitation.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence linking childhood intelligence with adult health outcomes suggests a need to identify predictors of this psychological characteristic. In this study, we have examined the early life determinants of childhood intelligence in a population-based birth cohort of individuals born in Brisbane, Australia between 1981 and 1984. In univariable analyses, family income in the year of birth, maternal and paternal education, maternal age at birth, maternal ethnicity, maternal smoking during pregnancy, duration of labour, birthweight, breast feeding and childhood height, and body mass index were all associated with intelligence at age 14. In multivariable analyses, the strongest and most robust predictors of intelligence were family income, parental education and breast feeding, with these three variables explaining 7.5% of the variation in intelligence at age 14. Addition of other variables added little further explanatory power. Our results demonstrate the importance of indicators of socio-economic position as predictors of intelligence, and illustrate the need to consider the role of such factors in generating the association of childhood intelligence with adult disease risk.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that executive functions (EFs) are related to intelligence, despite neuropsychological results initially considered evidence of no such relation. However, findings that EFs are not unitary raise the issue of how intelligence relates to different EFs. This study examined the relations of fluid and crystallized intelligence and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IQ to three separable EFs--inhibiting prepotent responses (inhibiting), shifting mental sets (shifting), and updating working memory (updating)--in young adults. Updating was highly correlated with the intelligence measures, but inhibiting and shifting were not. Furthermore, in structural equation models controlling for the inter-EF correlations, updating remained strongly related to intelligence, but the relations of inhibiting and shifting to intelligence were small and not significant. The results indicate that intelligence measures differentially relate to these three EFs, suggesting that current intelligence measures do not equally assess a wide range of executive control abilities likely required for many \"intelligent\" behaviors.",

William Grey Walter, a young researcher finishing his post-graduate studies at Cambridge, was selected to construct and study the EEG in clinical neurology at the Maudsley Hospital, London. His hugely productive pioneering career in the use of EEG would eventually lead to groundbreaking work in other fields --the emerging sciences of robotics, cybernetics, and early work in artificial intelligence. In this historical note his pioneering work in the fields of clinical neurophysiology is documented, both in the areas of epileptology and tumour detection. His landmark contributions to clinical neurophysiology are worthy of documentation.",

None of those subject of the study presented mental deficiency neither neurological dysfunctions. The age stocking was of 24.28 years, with a range between 20 and 28 years.\nThere are not differences in the intellectual quotient (verbal and performance), among the two groups. The LHG obtains worse results that the right-handed in speed of prosecution and in the subtests of arithmetic and key, while the RHG has obtained better results in the subtest of incomplete figures.\nThe LHG has a cognitive yield similar to that of the RHG, with slight deficiencies in activities of visoperceptual component. It becomes necessary to continue deepening in the neuropsychological and cognitive differences between right-handed and left-handed, since the cognitive outcome of the left-handed ones continues being a topic in discussion.",

    "abstract": "The monitoring and detection of nosocomial infections is a very important problem arising in hospitals. A hospital-acquired or nosocomial infection is a disease that develops after admission into the hospital and it is the consequence of a treatment, not necessarily a surgical one, performed by the medical staff. Nosocomial infections are dangerous because they are caused by bacteria which have dangerous (critical) resistance to antibiotics. This problem is very serious all over the world. In Italy, almost 5-8% of the patients admitted into hospitals develop this kind of infection. In order to reduce this figure, policies for controlling infections should be adopted by medical practitioners. In order to support them in this complex task, we have developed a system, called MERCURIO, capable of managing different aspects of the problem. The objectives of this system are the validation of microbiological data and the creation of a real time epidemiological information system. The system is useful for laboratory physicians, because it supports them in the execution of the microbiological analyses; for clinicians, because it supports them in the definition of the prophylaxis, of the most suitable antibi-otic therapy and in monitoring patients' infections; and for epidemiologists, because it allows them to identify outbreaks and to study infection dynamics. In order to achieve these objectives, we have adopted expert system and data mining techniques. We have also integrated a statistical module that monitors the diffusion of nosocomial infections over time in the hospital, and that strictly interacts with the knowledge based module. Data mining techniques have been used for improving the system knowledge base. The knowledge discovery process is not antithetic, but complementary to the one based on manual knowledge elicitation. In order to verify the reliability of the tasks performed by MERCURIO and the usefulness of the knowledge discovery approach, we performed a test based on a dataset of real infection events. In the validation task MERCURIO achieved an accuracy of 98.5%, a sensitivity of 98.5% and a specificity of 99%. In the therapy suggestion task, MERCURIO achieved very high accuracy and specificity as well. The executed test provided many insights to experts, too (we discovered some of their mistakes). The knowledge discovery approach was very effective in validating part of the MERCURIO knowledge base, and also in extending it with new validation rules, confirmed by interviewed microbiologists and specific to the hospital laboratory under consideration.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the patterns of convergent validity for the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (Mayer, Salovey, & Caruso, 2002), a performance-based measure of emotional intelligence (EI) that entails presenting problems thought to have correct responses, and a self-report measure of EI (Schutte et al., 1998). The relations between EI and demographic characteristics of a diverse community sample (N = 223) concurred with previous research. However, the performance-based and self-report scales were not related to one another. Only self-reported EI scores showed a consistent pattern of relations with self-reported coping styles and depressive affect, whereas the performance-based measure demonstrated stronger relations with age, education, and receiving psychotherapy. We discuss implications for the validity of these measures and their utility.",

    "abstract": "Menu planning is an important part of personalized lifestyle counseling. The paper describes the results of an automated menu generator (MenuGene) of the web-based lifestyle counseling system Cordelia that provides personalized advice to prevent cardiovascular diseases.\nThe menu generator uses genetic algorithms to prepare weekly menus for web users. The objectives are derived from personal medical data collected via forms in Cordelia, combined with general nutritional guidelines. The weekly menu is modeled as a multilevel structure.\nResults show that the genetic algorithm-based method succeeds in planning dietary menus that satisfy strict numerical constraints on every nutritional level (meal, daily basis, weekly basis). The rule-based assessment proved capable of manipulating the mean occurrence of the nutritional components thus providing a method for adjusting the variety and harmony of the menu plans.\nBy splitting the problem into well determined sub-problems, weekly menu plans that satisfy nutritional constraints and have well assorted components can be generated with the same method that is for daily and meal plan generation.",

    "abstract": "This article reviews developments in the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in sports biomechanics over the last decade. It outlines possible uses of Expert Systems as diagnostic tools for evaluating faults in sports movements ('techniques') and presents some example knowledge rules for such an expert system. It then compares the analysis of sports techniques, in which Expert Systems have found little place to date, with gait analysis, in which they are routinely used. Consideration is then given to the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in sports biomechanics, focusing on Kohonen self-organizing maps, which have been the most widely used in technique analysis, and multi-layer networks, which have been far more widely used in biomechanics in general. Examples of the use of ANNs in sports biomechanics are presented for javelin and discus throwing, shot putting and football kicking. I also present an example of the use of Evolutionary Computation in movement optimization in the soccer throw in, which predicted an optimal technique close to that in the coaching literature. After briefly overviewing the use of AI in both sports science and biomechanics in general, the article concludes with some speculations about future uses of AI in sports biomechanics. Key PointsExpert Systems remain almost unused in sports biomechanics, unlike in the similar discipline of gait analysis.Artificial Neural Networks, particularly Kohonen Maps, have been used, although their full value remains unclear.Other AI applications, including Evolutionary Computation, have received little attention.",

Core findings indicate that men and women differ significantly according to their educational background. Among those who studied in a regular educational environment, the main predictor of men's QOL is their monthly income, whereas the main predictor for women is their level of attention deficit symptoms. The only predictor of QOL among men who studied in a special education program is the quality of contact with their mothers, whereas no significant predictor is observed among women.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to examine the relations among resting frontal brain electrical activity (EEG) (hypothesized to reflect a predisposition to positive versusnegative affect and ability to regulate emotions), emotional intelligence, and externalizing behaviors in a sample of non-clinical 10-year-old children. We found that boys had significantly lower emotional intelligence than girls, and low emotional intelligence was associated with significantly more externalizing behaviors (i.e., aggression and delinquency), replicating previous work. We also found that children with higher reported externalizing behaviors exhibited significantly greater relative right frontal EEG activity at rest compared with children with little to no externalizing behavioral problems. There was, however, no relation between emotional intelligence and the pattern of resting frontal EEG activity. Thus, emotional intelligence and the pattern of frontal EEG activation at rest are independent predictors of externalizing behaviors in children. Findings also suggest that individual differences in emotional intelligence may not be based on differences in levels of emotional regulation or the generation of positive affect as reflected in frontal EEG asymmetries, but rather other social and cognitive competencies required for adaptive behavior.",

    "abstract": "The construct of emotional intelligence (EI) has gained increasing popularity over the last 10 years and now has a relatively large academic and popular associated literature. EI is beginning to be discussed within the medical education literature, where, however, it is treated uncritically. This reflections paper aims to stimulate thought about EI and poses the question: Are we trying to measure the unmeasurable? The paper begins with an outline of the relevance and meaningfulness of the topic of EI for doctors. It continues with an overview of the main models and measures of EI. We then critique the psychometric properties of EI measures and give an illustrative case study where we tested the psychometric properties of the ECI-U with medical students. After our critique, we present an alternative model of EI and outline possible future directions for educational research.",

    "abstract": "The neural basis of variation in human intelligence is not well delineated. Numerous studies relating measures of brain size such as brain weight, head circumference, CT or MRI brain volume to different intelligence test measures, with variously defined samples of subjects have yielded inconsistent findings with correlations from approximately 0 to 0.6, with most correlations approximately 0.3 or 0.4. The study of intelligence in relation to postmortem cerebral volume is not available to date. We report the results of such a study on 100 cases (58 women and 42 men) having prospectively obtained Full Scale Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale scores. Ability correlated with cerebral volume, but the relationship depended on the realm of intelligence studied, as well as the sex and hemispheric functional lateralization of the subject. General verbal ability was positively correlated with cerebral volume and each hemisphere's volume in women and in right-handed men accounting for 36% of the variation in verbal intelligence. There was no evidence of such a relationship in non-right-handed men, indicating that at least for verbal intelligence, functional asymmetry may be a relevant factor in structure-function relationships in men, but not in women. In women, general visuospatial ability was also positively correlated with cerebral volume, but less strongly, accounting for approximately 10% of the variance. In men, there was a non-significant trend of a negative correlation between visuospatial ability and cerebral volume, suggesting that the neural substrate of visuospatial ability may differ between the sexes. Analyses of additional research subjects used as test cases provided support for our regression models. In men, visuospatial ability and cerebral volume were strongly linked via the factor of chronological age, suggesting that the well-documented decline in visuospatial intelligence with age is related, at least in right-handed men, to the decrease in cerebral volume with age. We found that cerebral volume decreased only minimally with age in women. This leaves unknown the neural substrate underlying the visuospatial decline with age in women. Body height was found to account for 1-4% of the variation in cerebral volume within each sex, leaving the basis of the well-documented sex difference in cerebral volume unaccounted for. With finer testing instruments of specific cognitive abilities and measures of their associated brain regions, it is likely that stronger structure-function relationships will be observed. Our results point to the need for responsibility in the consideration of the possible use of brain images as intelligence tests.",

    "abstract": "With the development of computing technology, mechanistic models are often employed to simulate processes in coastal environments. However, these predictive tools are inevitably highly specialized, involving certain assumptions and/or limitations, and can be manipulated only by experienced engineers who have a thorough understanding of the underlying theories. This results in significant constraints on their manipulation as well as large gaps in understanding and expectations between the developers and practitioners of a model. The recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are making it possible to integrate machine learning capabilities into numerical modeling systems in order to bridge the gaps and lessen the demands on human experts. The objective of this paper is to review the state-of-the-art in the integration of different AI technologies into coastal modeling. The algorithms and methods studied include knowledge-based systems, genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy inference systems. More focus is given to knowledge-based systems, which have apparent advantages over the others in allowing more transparent transfers of knowledge in the use of models and in furnishing the intelligent manipulation of calibration parameters. Of course, the other AI methods also have their individual contributions towards accurate and reliable predictions of coastal processes. The integrated model might be very powerful, since the advantages of each technique can be combined.",

    "abstract": "More empirical work is needed to examine the dimensionality of personal epistemology and relations between those dimensions and motivational and strategic components of self-regulated learning. In particular, there is great need to investigate personal epistemology and its relation to self-regulated learning across cultures and academic contexts. Because the demarcation between personal epistemology and implicit theories of intelligence has been questioned, dimensions of personal epistemology should also be studied in relation to implicit theories of intelligence.\nThe primary aim was to examine the dimensionality of personal epistemology and the relation between those dimensions and implicit theories of intelligence in the cultural context of Norwegian postsecondary education. A secondary aim was to examine the relative contribution of epistemological beliefs and theories of intelligence to motivational and strategic components of self-regulated learning in different academic contexts within that culture.\nThe first sample included 178 business administration students in a traditional transmission-oriented instructional context; the second, 108 student teachers in an innovative pedagogical context.\nThe dimensionality of the Schommer Epistemological Questionnaire was examined through factor analyses, and the resulting dimensions were examined in relation to implicit theories of intelligence. We performed multiple regression analyses, separately for the two academic contexts, to try to predict motivational (i.e. self-efficacy beliefs, mastery goal orientation, and interest) and strategic (i.e. self-regulatory strategy use) components of self-regulated learning with epistemological beliefs and implicit theories of intelligence.\nConsiderable cross-cultural generalizability was found for the dimensionality of personal epistemology. Moreover, the dimensions of personal epistemology seemed to represent constructs separate from the construct of implicit theories of intelligence. Differences in the predictability of the epistemological dimensions were found for the two samples. For the student teachers, belief about knowledge construction and modification was a better predictor of self-regulated learning. For the business administration students, belief about the certainty of knowledge played a more important role in self-regulated learning.\nEpistemological beliefs predict self-regulated learning among Norwegian postsecondary students and play more important roles than implicit theories of intelligence. Relations between epistemological beliefs and self-regulated learning may vary with academic context.",

Multilevel analyses with a control variable show that when these threats are removed, two major results emerge: (a) birth order has no significant influence on children's intelligence and (b) earlier reported birth order effects on intelligence are attributable to factors that vary between, not within, families. Analyses on 7- to 8 - and 13- to 14-year-old children from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth support these conclusions.

The first is the use of technology to make products \"intelligent\"--that is, build them not only to measure a particular parameter, like blood glucose, but to help patients and caregivers manage conditions. This allows the users of these products focus less on the technical aspects of treating a condition (e.g. calculating the proper amount of insulin to treat a given level of blood glucose) and more on the overall management of the disease. The second development is the rapid movement of devices from the doctor's office to the home. Chain drug stores carry dozens of medical devices for home use by consumers. The challenge for manufacturers and designers is to present the medical device's intelligence in a way that is palatable to the consumer. One important theme is that medical product consumers are also consumers of everything else: home electronics, appliances, clothing, etc. These consumers are applying the same decision-making processes they use when buying a blender to the process of buying a medical device. It is therefore necessary for medical product manufacturers to create devices that interact with consumers in consumer-friendly ways. Putting intelligence into a product is one thing; helping the consumer utilize and appreciate it is quite another. This chapter covers some principles to keep in mind, and discusses a framework for better design of intelligent medical products that connect with consumers on emotional and functional levels beyond simple medical efficacy.",

    "abstract": "While recent studies have reported an inverse relation between childhood intelligence test scores and all-cause mortality in later life, the link with disease-specific outcomes has been rarely examined. Furthermore, the potential confounding effect of birthweight and childhood social circumstances is unknown. We investigated the relation of childhood intelligence with coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke risk in a cohort of 6910 men born in 1953 in the Copenhagen area of Denmark. Events were ascertained from 1978 to 2000 using a cause-of-death register and hospital discharge records. There were 150 CHD (19 fatal; 131 non-fatal) and 93 stroke (4 fatal; 89 non-fatal) events during follow-up into mid-life. Childhood intelligence was inversely related to CHD with the highest rate apparent in adults with low childhood test scores (HR(lowest vs. highest quartile), 2.70; 95% confidence interval: 1.60, 4.57; P(trend) = 0.0001). After adjustment for paternal social class and birthweight, this association was attenuated only marginally. There was little evidence of a IQ-stroke relationship. The cognitive characteristics captured by IQ testing in the present study, such as communication and problem solving ability, appear to be associated with risk of CHD. Health promotion specialists and clinical practitioners may wish to consider these skills in their interactions with the general public. Replication of these results using studies which hold data on intelligence and socio-economic position across the life course is required.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) was measured in 200 youth ages 16-19. EI scores were compared to demographic characteristics of the individuals (age, sex, household income, parents' level of education, and location of residence). Findings indicate that EI levels were positively related to females, parents' education, and household income. The study did not show significant relationships between adolescent EI and location of residence or age. EI scores were significantly different between females and males, with females reporting higher EI levels. A one-way ANOVA showed no significant differences between EI scores and age, location of residence, and household income. Significant differences were found based upon EI scores for parents' education; as they increased, so did EI levels. In a linear regression model, with demograpics as the independent variables and EI as the dependent variable, father's education and sex were both predictors. The results will guide future studies to determine the factors behind adolescent El formation and development.",

    "abstract": "Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a hormone that mediates the effects of growth hormone and plays a critical role in somatic growth regulation and organ development. It is hypothesized that it also plays a key role in human brain development. Previous studies have investigated the association of low IGF-I levels attributable to growth hormone receptor deficiency with intelligence but produced mixed results. We are aware of no studies that investigated the association of IGF-I levels with IQ in population samples of normal children.\nTo investigate the association of circulating levels of IGF-I and its principle binding protein, IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), in childhood with subsequent measures of IQ.\nThe cohort study was based on data for 547 white singleton boys and girls, members of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, with IGF-I and IGFBP-3 measurements (obtained at a mean age of 8.0 years) and IQ measured with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (at a mean age of 8.7 years). We also investigated associations with measures of speech and language based on the Wechsler Objective Reading Dimensions test (measured at an age of 7.5 years) and the Wechsler Objective Language Dimensions test (listening comprehension subtest only, measured at an age of 8.7 years). For some children (n = 407), IGF-I (but not IGFBP-3) levels had been measured at approximately 5 years of age in a previous study. Linear regression models were used to investigate associations of the IGF-I system with the measures of cognitive function.\nThree hundred one boys and 246 girls were included in the sample. IGF-I levels (mean +/- SD) were 142.6 +/- 53.9 ng/mL for boys and 154.4 +/- 51.6 ng/mL for girls. IQ scores (mean +/- SD) were 106.05 +/- 16.6 and 105.27 +/- 15.6 for boys and girls, respectively. IGF-I levels were associated positively with intelligence. For every 100 ng/mL increase in IGF-I, IQ increased by 3.18 points (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52 to 5.84 points). These positive associations were seen in relation to the verbal component (coefficient: 4.27; 95% CI: 1.62 to 6.92), rather than the performance component (coefficient: 1.06; 95% CI: -1.67 to 3.78), of IQ. There was no evidence that associations with overall IQ differed between boys and girls. In a data set with complete information on confounders (n = 484), controlling for birth weight (adjusted for gestation), breastfeeding, and BMI slightly strengthened the associations of IGF-I levels with IQ. Additionally controlling for maternal education and IGFBP-3 levels attenuated the associations (change in IQ for every 100 ng/mL increase in IGF-I levels: 2.51 points; 95% CI: -0.42 to 5.44 points). The weakening of associations in models controlling for markers of parental socioeconomic position and education could reflect shared influences of parental IGF levels on parents' own educational attainment and their offspring's IGF-I levels. In unadjusted models examining associations of Wechsler Objective Reading Dimensions and Wechsler Objective Language Dimensions test scores with IGF-I levels, there was no strong evidence that performance on either of these tests was associated with circulating IGF-I levels, although positive associations were seen with both measures. Associations between IGF-I levels measured at age 5 and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children scores (n = 407) were similar to those for IGF-I levels measured at age 7 to 8. For every 100 ng/mL increase in IGF-I levels at 5 years of age, IQ increased by 2.3 points (95% CI: -0.21 to 4.89 points).\nThis study provides some preliminary evidence that IGF-I is associated with brain development in childhood. Additional longitudinal research is required to clarify the role of IGF-I in neurodevelopment. Because IGF-I levels are modifiable through diet and other environmental exposures, this may be one pathway through which the childhood environment may influence neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "High emotional intelligence (EI) is associated with decreased adolescent smoking. Acculturation to the United States is a risk factor for adolescent smoking. High EI may buffer the relationship between acculturation to the United States and perceptions of the social consequences of smoking (PSC). Emotional intelligence is the ability to: accurately perceive, appraise, and express emotion; access and/or generate feelings in facilitating thought; understand emotion and emotional knowledge; and regulate emotions. Emotional intelligence (measured by the Multifactor Emotional Intelligence Scale, Adolescent Version), acculturation, and PSC were assessed in 2001 from 416 Southern California sixth graders (47% boys; mean age = 11.3 yrs; 32% Hispanic/ Latino, 29% Asian/Pacific Islander, 13% White, 19% Multiethnic, 6% Other). There was a significant EI x US acculturation interaction (p < 0.01) suggesting that those with high EI perceived more social consequences associated with smoking. As the U.S. population becomes increasingly diversified, identifying protective variables and designing effective prevention programs for adolescents of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds becomes important.",

    "abstract": "Diagnostic neuropsychological assessment requires the clinician to estimate a patient's premorbid abilities. Word reading tests, such as the National Adult Reading Test-Revised (NART-R), provide reasonably accurate estimates of premorbid IQ, but their capacity to benchmark other premorbid cognitive abilities remains unclear. In this extension of an earlier report, we administered the NART-R, an abbreviated Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-R or WAIS-III), and 26 other cognitive measures to 322 reasonably healthy adults. While NART-R performance correlated robustly (rs > or = .72) with concurrent Verbal and Full Scale IQ, its correlation with all other cognitive measures was significantly lower. Thus, while it is appealing to use word reading as a proxy for premorbid functioning in other cognitive domains, the NART-R has limited utility for this because it does not predict current performance on other cognitive tests as well as it predicts IQ in healthy adults.",

    "abstract": "Across 85 countries around the world, Voracek (2004) found a significant positive relation between estimated national intelligence (IQ) and national male and female suicide rate. The relation was not attenuated when countries' per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and type of national IQ estimation were statistically controlled. Independently, investigating the total national suicide rate only, Lester (2003) arrived at the same conclusion. These two findings are consistent with a corollary of de Catanzaro's (1981) evolutionary theory of human suicide, namely that a threshold intelligence is necessary for suicidality and that intelligence and suicide mortality should thus be positively related. Here, further evidence for this hypothesis is bolstered by focusing on suicide rates of the elderly. Across 48 Eurasian countries, estimated national IQ was significantly positively related to national suicide rates of people aged 65 years and over. This new ecological-level finding survived statistical controlling for a set of seven variables (type of national IQ estimation, national GDP, stableness and recency measures for suicide rates, and rates of adult literacy, urbanization and Roman Catholics), which thus are not confounding factors for the relation of intelligence and suicide mortality. Based on ecological data, the threshold IQ for suicidality is predicted to be 70 or slightly over, an estimate that is consistent with various suicidological observations.",

    "abstract": "The paper analyses to what extent the timing of the very first date of American adolescents in the 1960s correlated with their physical stature and cognitive ability. Using an event history approach, it was found that intelligence and a weight slightly above the average raised the odds of arranging a first rendezvous, whereas the effect of height was gender-specific. Tallness improved chances among boys, whereas girls whose height was slightly below the average had the highest odds. This pattern was mirrored by the adolescents' evaluation of their own physical stature. The fact that the estimated associations are remarkably similar to those observed in the literature on fertility and wages suggests that these attributes are selection criteria in situations of social interaction already among adolescents.",

Many disciplines (e.g. engineering, robotics, computer science) bear on the problem of automating the different stages involved in post-genomic research with a view to developing quality assured high-dimensional data. We review some of the latest contributions of AI and robotics to this end and note the limitations arising from the current independent, exploratory way in which specific solutions are being presented for specific problems without regard to how these could be eventually integrated into one comprehensible integrated intelligent system.",

Concrete specimens in this experiment, which were designed to have the strengths of 180, 210, 240, 300, and 400 kg/cm2, respectively, have been considered. Variance, zero-crossing, mean frequency, autoregressive (AR) model coefficients, and linear cepstrum coefficients are extracted as feature parameters from ultrasonic signals of concretes. Pattern recognition is carried out through the evidence accumulation procedure using the distances measured with reference parameters. A fuzzy mapping function is introduced to transform the distance for the application of the evidence accumulation method. Results are presented to support the feasibility of the suggested approach for concrete pattern identification.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a computer based science which aims to simulate human brain faculties using a computational system. A brief history of this new science goes from the creation of the first artificial neuron in 1943 to the first artificial neural network application to genetic algorithms. The potential for a similar technology in medicine has immediately been identified by scientists and researchers. The possibility to store and process all medical knowledge has made this technology very attractive to assist or even surpass clinicians in reaching a diagnosis. Applications of AI in medicine include devices applied to clinical diagnosis in neurology and cardiopulmonary diseases, as well as the use of expert or knowledge-based systems in routine clinical use for diagnosis, therapeutic management and for prognostic evaluation. Biological applications include genome sequencing or DNA gene expression microarrays, modeling gene networks, analysis and clustering of gene expression data, pattern recognition in DNA and proteins, protein structure prediction. In the field of hematology the first devices based on AI have been applied to the routine laboratory data management. New tools concern the differential diagnosis in specific diseases such as anemias, thalassemias and leukemias, based on neural networks trained with data from peripheral blood analysis. A revolution in cancer diagnosis, including the diagnosis of hematological malignancies, has been the introduction of the first microarray based and bioinformatic approach for molecular diagnosis: a systematic approach based on the monitoring of simultaneous expression of thousands of genes using DNA microarray, independently of previous biological knowledge, analysed using AI devices. Using gene profiling, the traditional diagnostic pathways move from clinical to molecular based diagnostic systems.",

The purpose of the study was to explore the relationship between emotional intelligence and perceived stress in the workplace and health-related consequences in human service workers.\nA sample of 330 participants (42.4% of men and 57.6% of women), representing various human service professions (physicians, nurses, teachers, probation officers and managers) was eligible for the study. The mean age of the participants was 38.4 years (SD = 8.45), and the employment period was 8.3 years (SD = 6.13). Three methods were used in the study: The Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire--INTE with Polish modification, the Subjective Work Evaluation Questionnaire developed in Poland, and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) with Polish modification.\nThe results confirmed an essential, but not very strong, role of emotional intelligence in perceiving occupational stress and preventing employees of human services from negative health outcomes.\nThe ability to effectively deal with emotions and emotional information in the workplace assists employees in coping with occupational stress therefore, it should be developed in stress managing trainings.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, research has progressed steadily in regard to the use of computers to recognize and render sign language. This paper reviews significant projects in the field beginning with finger-spelling hands such as \"Ralph\" (robotics), CyberGloves (virtual reality sensors to capture isolated and continuous signs), camera-based projects such as the CopyCat interactive American Sign Language game (computer vision), and sign recognition software (Hidden Markov Modeling and neural network systems). Avatars such as \"Tessa\" (Text and Sign Support Assistant; three-dimensional imaging) and spoken language to sign language translation systems such as Poland's project entitled \"THETOS\" (Text into Sign Language Automatic Translator, which operates in Polish; natural language processing) are addressed. The application of this research to education is also explored. The \"ICICLE\" (Interactive Computer Identification and Correction of Language Errors) project, for example, uses intelligent computer-aided instruction to build a tutorial system for deaf or hard-of-hearing children that analyzes their English writing and makes tailored lessons and recommendations. Finally, the article considers synthesized sign, which is being added to educational material and has the potential to be developed by students themselves.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether breastfeeding during infancy is a determinant of intelligence at 3.5 y.\nFive hundred and fifty European children enrolled at birth in the Auckland Birthweight Collaborative Study were assessed at 3.5 y of age. Approximately half were small for gestational age (SGA < or =10th percentile) at birth and half were appropriate for gestational age (AGA >10th percentile). Duration of breastfeeding was recorded at maternal interview, and the intelligence of children was assessed using the Stanford Binet Intelligence Scale. Regression analysis was used to calculate estimates of difference in intelligence scores between breastfeeding groups for the total sample and the group of SGA children. Analyses of the total sample were weighted to account for the disproportionate sampling of SGA children.\nBreastfeeding was not significantly related to intelligence scores in the total sample despite a trend for longer periods of breastfeeding to be associated with higher intelligence scores. However, in the SGA group, breastfeeding was significantly related to IQ at 3.5 y. Small for gestational age children who were breastfed for longer than 12 mo had adjusted scores 6.0 points higher than those who were not breastfed (p=0.06).\nBreastfeeding may be particularly important for the cognitive development of preschool children born small for gestational age.",

    "abstract": "The health effects of drinking may be related to psychological characteristics influencing both health and drinking habits. This study aims to examine the relationship between intelligence, later beverage preference and alcohol intake.\nProspective cohort study.\nZealand, Denmark.\nA total of 900 obese men and a random population sample of 899 young men.\nIntelligence testing at the draft board examinations over a 22-year period between 1956 and 1977. Percentage of wine of total alcohol intake (wine pct), preference for wine (wine pct >50), heavy drinking (>21 drinks per week) and non-drinking (<1 drink per week), and vocational education from follow-ups of the initial study sample in 1981-83 and 1992-94.\nA strong dose-response-like association was found between intelligence quotient (IQ) in young adulthood and beverage preferences later in life in both the obese and the random population sample. At the first follow-up a 30-point advantage in IQ [2 standard deviations (SD)] was found to be associated with an odds ratio (OR) for preferring wine over beer and spirits of 1.7 (1.3-2.4). At the second follow-up the corresponding OR was 2.8 (2.0-3.9). A 30-point advantage in IQ was found to be associated with an OR for being a non-drinker of 0.5 (0.3-0.8) at the first follow-up and second follow-up. We examined whether, at the second follow-up, the association between IQ, beverage preferences and non-drinking could be explained by socio-economic position (SEP). The association between IQ and non-drinking disappeared when controlling for SEP. The association between IQ and beverage preferences was attenuated, but remained statistically significant. IQ was not associated with heavy drinking.\nIrrespective of socio-economic position, a high IQ was associated with preference for wine to other beverages, but IQ was not related similarly to alcohol consumption.",

    "abstract": "The California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C) provides clinicians with a method of assessing various aspects of children's verbal memory and has been found to be sensitive to memory deficits resulting from a variety of neurological conditions. Intuitively, the CVLT-C would be expected to be highly related to a child's verbal cognitive abilities; however, with only a few exceptions, the relationship of this test to various domains of cognitive function has not been broadly studied empirically. To examine this issue, we evaluated the amount of unique variance in CVLT-C scores that could be predicted by the Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Organization, Freedom from Distractibility, and Processing Speed indices of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition (WISC-III) beyond that accounted for by age and gender in a sample of 62 children referred to an outpatient psychiatry clinic for neuropsychological evaluation. While the Processing Speed Index predicted a significant amount of variance for both short and long delay free and cued recall, the Verbal Comprehension Index was a poor predictor of CVLT-C performance on all outcome variables, accounting for only 1.5 to 4.5% additional variance above age and gender. These findings indicate that while the CVLT-C may be relatively independent of influences of verbal intelligence and abstract verbal reasoning, general speed and efficiency of processing play an important role in successful encoding for later retrieval on the CVLT-C.",

    "abstract": "Empirical studies using the PCL-R (Hare, 2003) have shown no intelligence differences between psychopaths and nonpsychopaths. However, Cleckley (1976) argued that psychopaths often show superior intelligence. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the correlation between intelligence and severity of criminal development is the opposite in psychopaths than in nonpsychopathic criminals using a sample of 370 men sentenced for violent (nonsexual) crimes. That pattern would provide a way of explaining the discrepancy between Cleckley's view and later empirical work. The results showed that for nonpsychopaths, higher total IQ and particularly verbal intelligence meant a later start in violent crime. For those diagnosed as psychopaths, however, this association was reversed.",

Data on 1181 identical and 1412 fraternal twin pairs (all males) were retrieved by matching files from the Norwegian Army with twin registries. The data were analyzed by means of a structural equation model comprising latent genetic, shared environmental and nonshared environmental factors and correlations between them. A major part of the height--intelligence correlation was due to correlated shared environments (59% of the phenotypic height--intelligence correlation), but statistically significant effects of correlated genes and nonshared environments were also found (respectively 35% and 6% of the phenotypic correlation).",

    "abstract": "The National Kidney Foundation Guidelines (DOQI) and the European Renal Association (ERA) have set standards for adequacy of hemodialysis treatment. They recommended minimum single pool doses of 1.2 (Kt/Vsp DOQI), and 1.4 (Kt/Vsp ERA) and a \"standard\" urea removal ratio (URR) of 65%. Here, we compare an Artificial Intelligence Method (AIM) based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the usual methods for hemodialysis treatment follow-up such as Smye, Daugirdas, standard urea reduction ratio (URR using post-dialysis urea concentration) and modified URR [Cheng et al. 2001] against equilibrated Kt/V and URR calculated using a 60 min post-dialysis urea concentration.\nWe used ROC analysis to evaluate and compare these methodologies. We also propose a method to find a minimum target dose that maximizes the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values of the diagnostic tool.\nFrom a URR point of view, the ANN, stdURR and mURR perform almost equally well with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90, 0.93 and 0.92, respectively, but the ANN achieved the lowest false positive rate (FPR = 7.94%) and error rate (ER = 12.7%). When Kt/V is used as a dose index, the logarithmic single-and double-pool equations perform almost equally (AUC 0.957 and 0.962), and the ANN method achieves an AUC of 0.934. The lowest FPR was for ANN and Kt/Vsp (4.76%), which also achieved the lowest ER of 6.39%.\nFor both cases (URR and Kt/V), the minimum doses required to achieve the lowest FPR and ER for the standard methods (stdURR and Kt/Vsp) were higher than those reported by the DOQI guidelines, being 70% for stdURR and 1.35 for Kt/Vsp, whereas for those methods using the double-pool Kt/V or equilibrated URR, the dose targets were close to those recommended by DOQI and ERA. Our proposed method for target dose selection is easy to understand, and it takes into account both accuracy and confidence of the adequacy tool. We found the ANN method to be superior to the Smye method for estimation of equilibrated urea, and the results presented here suggest that ANN methods could be useful tools in the analysis of nephrology data.",

    "abstract": "Microbial processes operated under realistic conditions are difficult to describe by mechanistic models, thereby limiting their optimization and control. Responses of living cells to their environment suggest that they possess some \"innate intelligence\". Such responses have been modeled by a cybernetic approach. Furthermore, the overall behavior of a bioreactor containing a population of cells may be described and controlled through artificial intelligence methods. Therefore, it seems logical to combine cybernetic models with artificial intelligence to evolve an integrated intelligence-based strategy that is physiologically more faithful than the current approaches. This possibility is discussed, together with practical considerations favoring a hybrid approach that includes some mathematical modeling.",

In this study, we assessed the SSRI's incremental validity for a wide range of adjustment criteria, pitting it against a competing trait measure, the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI; Costa & McCrae, 1992), and tests of fluid and crystallized intelligence. At a broad bandwidth, the SSRI total score significantly and uniquely predicted variance beyond NEO-FFI domain scores in the UCLA Loneliness Scale, Revised (Russell, Peplau, & Cutrono, 1980) scores. Higher fidelity analyses using previously identified SSRI factors and NEO-FFI item clusters revealed that the SSRI's Optimism/Mood Regulation and Emotion Appraisal factors contributed unique variance to self-reported study habits and social stress, respectively. The potential moderation of incremental validity by gender did not reach significance due to loss of power from splitting the sample, and mediational analyses revealed the SSRI Optimism/Mood Regulation factor was both directly and indirectly related to various criteria. We discuss the small magnitude of incremental validity coefficients and the differential incremental validity of SSRI factor and total scores.",

    "abstract": "The study investigated gender differences in resting EEG (in three individually determined narrow alpha frequency bands) related to the level of general and emotional intelligence. Brain activity of males decreased with the level of general intelligence, whereas an opposite pattern of brain activity was observed in females. This difference was most pronounced in the upper-alpha band which is related to semantic memory processes. It was further found that highly intelligent males displayed greater decoupling of frontal brain areas, whereas highly intelligent females showed more coupling between frontal and parietal/occipital brain areas. Similar, but less significant differences were observed for the two area scores of strategic and experiential emotional intelligence. It appears that males and females have different resting EEG correlates of IQ.",

The purpose of our study was to create and compare: 1) an artificial neural network, 2) genetic program, 3) fuzzy-neural system that can diagnose acid-base disorders, based on a set of laboratory gasometric and electrolyte measurements. We took into account 7 single acid-base disorders, 11 double acid-base disorders and 6 triple complicated disorders with accompanying anion gap alterations. We prepared a set laboratory measurements consisting of 250 results for training and the same number of results for testing the program. Finally, the efficiency of presented artificial intelligence (AI) methods has been described and compared.",

    "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) appears to cause cognitive dysfunction as well as other serious neurologic sequelae. To confirm whether SE produces a subsequent intellectual decline, we evaluated intellectual function prospectively in adult epilepsy patients with and without SE.\nOf 1,685 patients with epilepsy who underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing in two national hospitals in Japan, 15 patients experienced an episode of SE afterward and underwent the second neuropsychological examination after the SE episode. Forty clinically matched patients with epilepsy, but without an episode of SE since their initial neuropsychological examination, were also reevaluated. We compared IQs and subscores from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised between the two groups by repeated measures analysis of variance. In the patients who experienced an SE episode, SE-related variables (i.e., age at the SE episode and type and duration of SE) and epilepsy-related variables such as epilepsy type, lateralization of EEG abnormalities, the presence of mesial temporal sclerosis, and previous history of SE, were evaluated in relation to intellectual outcome.\nPatients with SE, in comparison to those without SE, failed to show any significant post-SE intellectual decline. Furthermore, neither the SE-related variables nor the clinical characteristics were correlated with intellectual outcome.\nOur findings suggest that SE does not lead to a significant intellectual decline in adult patients receiving treatment for epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) have progressive respiratory muscle weakness. Spirometry monitors progress, but is effort-dependent. Intelligence quotients (IQ) average one standard deviation below normal, and behavioral disturbance is common. Our aim was to assess if impaired intelligence or behavior influences spirometry in children with DMD, and if computerized visual incentives (CVI) are beneficial. Forty-seven boys with DMD, of mean age 12.6 years (range, 6-19), were recruited. Full-scale, performance, and verbal IQ, and parent-and-teacher-reported oppositional behavior scores, were recorded. Each was divided into moderate, mild, and no impairment groups. A randomized crossover design was applied to performing spirometry with or without CVI first. A Jaeger Masterscope (version 4.60) was used. Linear regression defined the relationship between spirometry and both IQ and behavior scores. The paired Student's t- test compared spirometry performed with and without CVI for the overall group and subgroups. Boys with DMD can adequately perform spirometry. There is an association between %FEV1 and %FVC with full-scale (r = 0.50, P = 0.002; r = 0.49, P = 0.003, respectively), performance (r = 0.68, P < 0.0005; r = 0.68, P < 0.0005, respectively) and verbal (r = 0.39, P = 0.043; r = 0.36, P = 0.037, respectively) IQ, but not with parent (P = 0.77, P = 0.70, respectively) or teacher (P = 0.90, P = 0.90, respectively)-reported oppositional behavior scores. The effect of CVI was significant in those with moderate full-scale (P = 0.03), performance (P = 0.002), and verbal (P = 0.02) intellectual impairment, and moderately severe teacher-reported oppositional behavior (P = 0.02). In conclusion, spirometry results are related to intelligence in DMD. Using CVI improves the FVC obtained in those with moderate intellectual or behavioral impairment.",

This work is an upgrade to the previous concept of monitoring systems as systems with hybrid intelligence acting under variable conditions of object and medium. Human cardiorespiratory system was considered within the framework of the P. K. Anokhin theory of functional systems. The problem of resuscitation was formulated for this system and volume of required information was determined. Environment characteristics in resuscitation and surgery departments were considered. The requirements for monitor were formulated on the basis of analysis of these systems. The law of mutual adaptation of reanimatologist and monitor was put forward and safety problems associated with human factor were considered. Implementation of these principles in the MITAR 01-R-D is described.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent behavior is a complex adaptive phenomenon that has evolved to enable organisms to deal with variable environmental circumstances. Maximizing fitness requires skill in foraging for necessary resources (food) in competitive circumstances and is probably the activity in which intelligent behavior is most easily seen. Biologists suggest that intelligence encompasses the characteristics of detailed sensory perception, information processing, learning, memory, choice, optimisation of resource sequestration with minimal outlay, self-recognition, and foresight by predictive modeling. All these properties are concerned with a capacity for problem solving in recurrent and novel situations. Here I review the evidence that individual plant species exhibit all of these intelligent behavioral capabilities but do so through phenotypic plasticity, not movement. Furthermore it is in the competitive foraging for resources that most of these intelligent attributes have been detected. Plants should therefore be regarded as prototypical intelligent organisms, a concept that has considerable consequences for investigations of whole plant communication, computation and signal transduction.",

    "abstract": "The traditional assumption that children's nutritional deficiencies are essentially due either to overall food scarcity or to a lack of family resources to purchase available food has been increasingly questioned. Parental characteristics represent 1 type of noneconomic factor that may be related to variability in children's diets and nutritional status. We report evidence on the relation of 2 parental characteristics, maternal education level and maternal intelligence, to infant and toddler diet and nutritional status. Our sample consisted of 241 low-income Peruvian mothers and their infants assessed from 3 to 12 mo, with a further follow-up of 104 of these infants at 18 mo of age. Using a nonexperimental design, we related measures of level of maternal education, maternal intelligence, and family socioeconomic status to infant anthropometry, duration of exclusive breast-feeding, adequacy of dietary intake, and iron status. Results indicated unique positive relations between maternal education level and the extent of exclusive breast-feeding. Significant relations between maternal education and offspring length were partially mediated by maternal height. There also were unique positive relations between maternal intelligence and quality of offspring diet and hemoglobin level. All findings remained significant even after controlling for family socioeconomic characteristics. This pattern of results illustrates the importance of parental characteristics in structuring the adequacy of offspring diet. Maternal education and intelligence appear to have unique influences upon different aspects of the diet and nutritional status of offspring.",

    "abstract": "Research findings concerning cognitive effects of pediatric epilepsy surgery form an important basis for decisions about surgery. However, most follow-up studies have been of limited duration. In this study, a 2-year follow-up of intelligence was undertaken. Risk factors were analyzed. Included were 38 patients aged 3 to 17 years. Surgery was left in 19 patients and right in 19 patients. Types of surgery included temporal lobe resection (n = 23), extratemporal or multilobar resection (n = 8), and hemispherectomy (n = 7). The Wechsler Scales of Intelligence were administered presurgically, 6 months postsurgically, and 2 years postsurgically. No significant change in verbal or performance intelligence quotient (IQ) was demonstrated on a group level. Lateralization, type of surgery, age at surgery, sex, and presurgical IQ did not affect outcome. Across assessments, IQ scores of left-hemisphere patients were lower than those of right-hemisphere patients. Scores of patients in the hemispherectomy group were lower than those of the extratemporal or multilobar resection group, which were lower than the temporal lobe resection group. Scores improved significantly in six patients and deteriorated in seven. In conclusion, epilepsy surgery in children and adolescents does not, in general, have a significant impact on cognitive development in a 2-year perspective. In individual patients, poor seizure control and extensive surgery for Rasmussen's encephalitis were related to a deterioration of IQ.",

    "abstract": "Studies of short-term memory and general intelligence associated with duration and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on observed Type A scores are rare. The authors' aim was to assess Type A behavior and identify subgroups of patients who performed most poorly on memory and intelligence tests and Type A scores related to the severity and duration of their disease. They administered nonverbal memory and intelligence tests to 30 men with PTSD and 20 men without PTSD who responded. During their initial contact with the participants, 2 experts assessed 3 major coronary-prone characteristics (hyperalertness, tight facial musculature, and explosive speech). They found significant differences between the PTSD and control groups in total Type A scores. Those with the most severe PTSD performed most poorly on visual retention tests and showed the highest scores on self-reported and subjective diastolic blood pressure reactivity during magnetic resonance imaging. In the PTSD group, high error scores on the visual retention test predicted Type A behavior and low scores on the picture memory block design tests predicted high Type A scores. A significant positive correlation was found between Type A and clinician-assessed subjective distress, whereas the correlations were significantly negative between picture memory and Type A behavior Suppressed fear is commonly associated with PTSD; decades of research on Type A behavior have isolated fear as a crucial factor in cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANN) and genetic algorithms are one group of methods called artificial intelligence. The application of ANN on pharmaceutical data can lead to an understanding of the inner structure of data and a possibility to build a model (adaptation). In addition, for certain cases it is possible to extract rules from data. The adapted ANN is prepared for the prediction of properties of compounds which were not used in the adaptation phase. The applications of ANN have great potential in pharmaceutical industry and in the interpretation of analytical, pharmacokinetic or toxicological data.",

    "abstract": "General intelligence (g) is a common factor in diverse cognitive abilities and a major influence on life outcomes. Neuroimaging studies in adults suggest that the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices play a crucial role in related cognitive activities including fluid reasoning, the control of attention, and working memory. Here, we investigated the neural bases for intellectual giftedness (superior-g) in adolescents, using fMRI. The participants consisted of a superior-g group (n = 18, mean RAPM = 33.9 +/- 0.8, >99%) from the national academy for gifted adolescents and the control group (n = 18, mean RAPM = 22.8 +/- 1.6, 60%) from local high schools in Korea (mean age = 16.5 +/- 0.8). fMRI data were acquired while they performed two reasoning tasks with high and low g-loadings. In both groups, the high g-loaded tasks specifically increased regional activity in the bilateral fronto-parietal network including the lateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and posterior parietal cortices. However, the regional activations of the superior-g group were significantly stronger than those of the control group, especially in the posterior parietal cortex. Moreover, regression analysis revealed that activity of the superior and intraparietal cortices (BA 7/40) strongly covaried with individual differences in g (r = 0.71 to 0.81). A correlated vectors analysis implicated bilateral posterior parietal areas in g. These results suggest that superior-g may not be due to the recruitment of additional brain regions but to the functional facilitation of the fronto-parietal network particularly driven by the posterior parietal activation.",

    "abstract": "We propose the hypothesis that genes of human intelligence are related with metabolism of thyroid and steroids hormones, which have a crucial role in brain development and function. First, there is evidence to support the idea that during hominid evolution small genetic differences were related with significant endocrine changes in thyroid and steroids hormones. Second, these neuroactive hormones are also related with unique features of human evolution such as body and brain size increase, penis and breast enlargement, pelvic sexual dimorphism, active sexuality, relative lack of hair and higher longevity. Besides underling many of the differences between humans and great apes, steroids hormones promote brain growth and development, are important in the myelination process, explain sexual dimorphisms in brain and intelligence and improve specific cognitive abilities in humans. Supporting our hypothesis, recent studies indicate differences in neuroactive hormones metabolism between humans and non-human primates. Furthermore, a link between X chromosome genes and sex steroids may explain why the frequency of genes affecting intelligence is so high on the X chromosome. This association suggests that, during hominid evolution, there was a positive feedback in both sexes on the same genes responsible for secondary sexual character development and intelligence. This interaction leads to acceleration of development of human brain and intelligence. Finally, we propose that neuroactive hormone therapy may provide significant improvement in some cognitive deficits in all stages of human life and in cases of neurodegenerative diseases. However, further investigation is needed, mainly in the enzymatic machinery, in order to understand the direct role of these hormones in intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the gender-related differences in the clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have focused on specific aspects of the disease (eg, circulating metabolites, cognitive capacity, or epidemiologic trends).\nThis study accounts for several descriptors of the disease simultaneously, providing a multidimensional analysis of a cohort of patients with AD.\nOur analysis was conducted using self-organizing maps (SOMs). The high number (60) of independent variables (clinical, demographic, biochemical, and neuropsychological) observed in the study patients defines a complex and high-dimensional input space that can be processed by SOMs. Without supervision, SOMs examine nonlinear relations among the variables and cluster observations so that topologic relationships between variables correspond to the similarity of their distribution. Through such nonlinear autoclustering, subsets of observations (ie, clusters of subjects) can be identified in which essential information is concentrated. Each subject is identified by particular values of the variables (the record), and a specific set of variable values (the codebook) defines a distinct class.\nThe study sample included 211 patients with mild to moderate AD (143 women, 68 men; mean [SD] age, 71.9 [7.2] years). All patients were assigned to 3 macroclasses-called A, B, and C-on the basis of matrix codebook neighborhoods. In terms of vectorial distance between codebooks, class A and B were quite similar, whereas the separation between class C and classes A and B was evident. The SOM distribution of values of variables across the output matrix did not show any specific pattern for most of the considered characteristics. However, we found only male patients in class C. This class distinction was not substantially changed when sex was removed from the database. Male and female patients were comparable with respect to dementia severity, demographic characteristics, psychiatric and behavioral symptoms, indicators of physical disability, and general health status.\nSOMs indicate nonlinear multifactorial interactions among the descriptors of the features of AD that seem to be linked to sex and would have been missed by traditional statistical analysis. This finding may offer a novel epidemiologic rationale for research into different pathogenic mechanisms in men and women with AD.",

WMH volumes were quantified and partial correlations were calculated between WMH volume change and decline in WAIS scores from 80 to 85.\nProgression in WMH volume ranged from 0 ml to 20.7 ml, providing a median increase of 2.6 ml (range 0.1 to 20.7, p<0.001) and, with a mean time interval between scans of 3.8 years, a rate of progression of 0.63 (0 to 6.8) ml/year. WMH volume measures for the two hemispheres were highly correlated (r = 0.95) and did not differ significantly. Increase in WMH volume was correlated with a simultaneous decline in verbal IQ (r = -0.65, p = 0.001), while baseline WMH was associated with subsequent decline in performance subtests (digit symbol, r = -0.57, p = 0.02).\nThe association between WMH and decline in essential cognitive abilities even in well preserved elderly people suggests that WMH should be regarded as a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia.",

    "abstract": "The debate in forensic science concentrates on issues such as standardisation, accreditation and de-contextualisation, in a legal and economical context, in order to ensure the scientific objectivity and efficiency that must guide the process of collecting, analysing, interpreting and reporting forensic evidence. At the same time, it is recognised that forensic case data is still poorly integrated into the investigation and the crime analysis process, despite evidence of its great potential in various situations and studies. A change of attitude is needed in order to accept an extended role for forensic science that goes beyond the production of evidence for the court. To stimulate and guide this development, a long-term intensive modelling activity of the investigative and crime analysis process that crosses the boundaries of different disciplines has been initiated. A framework that fully integrates forensic case data shows through examples the capital accumulated that may be put to use systematically.",

Here, a scale named the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) was crossvalidated and compared with measures of personality (Big Five/5PFs), cognitive abilities (Raven's Advanced Matrices, Vocabulary, Number series), and social intelligence (TSIS). All measures were given to 482 applicants for the military college. Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the fit of the five-factor model, measuring 'personal strength', 'social competence', 'structured style', 'family cohesion' and 'social resources'. Using Big Five to discriminate between well adjusted and more vulnerable personality profiles, all resilience factors were positively correlated with the well adjusted personality profile. RSA-personal strength was most associated with 5PFs-emotional stability, RSA-social competence with 5PFs-extroversion and 5PFs-agreeableness, as well as TSIS-social skills, RSA-structured style with 5PFs-conscientiousness. Unexpectedly but interestingly, measures of RSA-family cohesion and RSA-social resources were also related to personality. Furthermore, the RSA was unrelated to cognitive abilities. This study supported the convergent and discriminative validity of the scale, and thus the inference that individuals scoring high on this scale are psychologically healthier, better adjusted, and thus more resilient.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to analyse the effect of risperidone on a priori defined core aggression items. Data were pooled from 163 boys (aged 5-12 years, with or without comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of either conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder who had participated in either of two identical, 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. All received treatment with either placebo or oral risperidone solution (0.01-0.06 mg/kg/day). Subjects had below average intelligence [intelligence quotient (IQ) 36-84] and a score of > or =24 on the Conduct Problem subscale of the Nisonger Child Behaviour Rating Form (N-CBRF). An expert advisory panel selected six core aggression items from the N-CBRF, from which a total Aggression Score (AS, range 0-18) was constructed. Compared to those treated with placebo, risperidone-treated subjects experienced significantly greater mean decreases from baseline in the AS at each of weeks 1-6 (P<0.001). By study endpoint, aggression among risperidone-treated subjects had declined by 56.4% (mean baseline AS 10.1; mean endpoint AS 4.4), which was more than twice that of placebo-treated subjects (mean baseline AS 10.6; mean endpoint AS 8.3; 21.7% reduction). Risperidone was efficacious in reducing symptoms of aggression in boys of below average IQ with disruptive behaviour disorders.",

    "abstract": "The United States intelligence community has been under intense scrutiny from both inside and outside in the aftermath of September 11. Post mortem assessments of intelligence breakdowns may judge the events as more predictable than was in fact the actual reality. In a troubled world, when threats to national security can materialize very quickly, the intelligence community must be able to effectively and swiftly develop and implement plans to prevent further terrorist attacks on the homeland. Numerous scenarios need to be considered for the management of crisis situations. Intelligence actions must make it more difficult for terrorists to strike at their targets. The war on terror must confront a new generation of enemies who threaten to attack the United States with weapons of mass destruction. This essay will focus on the role of behavioral science and how related reforms within the intelligence community could improve its capability to respond to a huge challenge.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between condition variables and child variables in children with craniofacial anomalies (CFA). Condition variables were brain anomalies, obliterated sutures, syndromic diagnosis, hypertelorism, phenotypical expression, age at craniotomy, and hospitalizations. Child variables were visual-motor integration (VMI), intelligence, and sex of subject. Setting was two university hospitals for children. Patients were 217 children with CFA, 125 boys and 92 girls, aged 5 to 16 years. Main outcome measure was the Developmental Test of VMI. Data on intelligence were obtained using different instruments, depending on the age and developmental level of the child. All IQ tests were standardized with mean 100 and standard deviation 15 or 16. Mean VMI score was 97.9 (SD = 17.1). Only 5.2% of the children scored below 70. For computing the mean IQ score, IQ scores below 50 were fixed at 0 as well as at 50. This procedure yielded a minimum mean IQ score of 94.0 (SD = 27.0) and a maximum mean IQ score of 95.8 (SD = 21.7). An IQ score below 70 was found in 14.1% of the children. A significant correlation was found between VMI and IQ score and the variables brain anomalies, syndromic diagnosis, hypertelorism, phenotypical expression, hospitalizations, and sex of subject. The majority of children with CFA (+/- 85%) score within the normal or borderline range for VMI or intelligence. Approximately 15% of the children with CFA have poor VMI skills or mental retardation. Risk factors for VMI and intelligence are the presence of brain anomalies, a syndromic diagnosis, hypertelorism, a severe phenotypical expression, a high frequency of hospitalizations, and the female sex.",

    "abstract": "Although, in the course of the last 50 years, the achievements in the medical field have been astonishing, at the beginning of the third millennium a number of clinical pictures are still left without a precise nosographic origin. In the past, the delay in scientific communication was the main explanation presented for the lack of understanding of clinical pictures of unknown nosographic origin. The history of medicine provides excellent examples of this dispersion of human capital, even if the history of clinical neurology presents \"exceptions\" (the pictures that we now call de la Tourette's syndrome and Parkinson's disease) that indicate that major clinical syndromes could be clearly detected and relatively rapidly diffused even in the 19th century. Contrary to the past, the delay in scientific communication no longer seems an obstacle to the sharing of medical knowledge. Nevertheless, the problem of the in-depth comprehension of clinical pictures of unknown nosographic origin still remains dominant, mainly because of the limited spread of ample and flexible online accessible databases of unknown nosographic origin clinical syndromes. The need for interactive electronic archives and other artificial intelligence resources in order to promote progress in clinical knowledge is discussed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "There are two inter-related categories of EEG measurement: 1, EEG currents or power and; 2, EEG network properties such as coherence and phase delays. The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of these two different categories of EEG measurement to predict performance on the Weschler Intelligence test (WISC-R).\nResting eyes closed EEG was recorded from 19 scalp locations with a linked ears reference from 442 subjects aged 5-52 years. The Weschler Intelligence test was administered to the same subjects but not while the EEG was recorded. Subjects were divided into high IQ (> or = 120) and low IQ (< or = 90) groups. EEG variables at P<.05 were entered into a factor analysis and then the single highest loading variable on each factor was entered into a discriminant analysis where groups were high IQ vs. low.Q.\nDiscriminant analysis of high vs. low IQ was 92.81-97.14% accurate. Discriminant scores of intermediate IQ subjects (i.e. 90 < IQ < 120) were intermediate between the high and low IQ groups. Linear regression predictions of IQ significantly correlated with the discriminant scores (r = 0.818-0.825, P < 10(-6)). The ranking of effect size was EEG phase > EEG coherence > EEG amplitude asymmetry > absolute power > relative power and power ratios. The strongest correlations to IQ were short EEG phase delays in the frontal lobes and long phase delays in the posterior cortical regions, reduced coherence and increased absolute power.\nThe findings are consistent with increased neural efficiency and increased brain complexity as positively related to intelligence, and with frontal lobe synchronization of neural resources as a significant contributing factor to EEG and intelligence correlations.\nQuantitative EEG predictions of intelligence provide medium to strong effect size estimates of cognitive functioning while simultaneously revealing a deeper understanding of the neurophysiological substrates of intelligence.",

    "abstract": "There is ongoing debate whether the efficiency of local cognitive processes leads to global cognitive ability or whether global ability feeds the efficiency of basic processes. A prominent example is the well-replicated association between inspection time (IT), a measure of perceptual discrimination speed, and intelligence (IQ), where it is not known whether increased speed is a cause or consequence of high IQ. We investigated the direction of causation between IT and IQ in 2012 genetically related subjects from Australia and The Netherlands. Models in which the reliable variance of each observed variable was specified as a latent trait showed IT correlations of -0.44 and -0.33 with respective Performance and Verbal IQ; heritabilities were 57% (IT), 83% (PIQ) and 77% (VIQ). Directional causation models provided poor fits to the data, with covariation best explained by pleiotropic genes (influencing variation in both IT and IQ). This finding of a common genetic factor provides a better target for identifying genes involved in cognition than genes which are unique to specific traits.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, an increasing number of research studies have focused on the construct of Emotional Intelligence (EI), which may be broadly defined as the capacity to perceive and regulate emotions in oneself as well as those of others. Researchers have generally adopted an organizational or management focus to the study of EI, however studies which adopt a more integrated perspective by combining psychological with biological measures, may help in further elucidating this relatively abstract construct. The first objective of this paper was to report on the psychometric properties of a brief, self-report measure of EI (Brain Resource Inventory for Emotional intelligence Factors or BRIEF), comprising internal emotional capacity (IEC), external emotional capacity (EEC) and self concept (SELF). Second, we further explored the validity of the measure by assessing the relationships between the BRIEF and variables considered relevant to the understanding of EI (including gender, age, personality, cognitive intelligence and resting state electroencephalography, EEG). The BRIEF possessed sound psychometric properties (internal consistency, r=0.68-0.81; test-retest reliability, r=0.92; construct validity with the Self Report Emotional Intelligence Test, r=0.70). As hypothesized, females were found to score higher than males on EI. EI was associated more with personality than with cognitive ability, and EEG was found to explain a significant portion of the variance in EI scores. The finding that low EI is related to underarousal of the left-frontal cortex (increased theta EEG) is consistent with research on patients with depression, as well as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Although EI did not display age-related increases, this might relate to the exclusion of adolescents from our sample. In conclusion, examination of the way in which EI measures relate to a complementary range of psychological and biological measures may help to further elucidate this construct.",

    "abstract": "There has been ongoing interest in the role of intelligence in longer-term educational and occupational achievement and social adjustment. The aims of this study were to examine the extent to which IQ in middle childhood (8-9 years) was prognostic of future outcomes when due allowance was made for confounding personal and social factors.\nData were gathered on (WISC-R) IQ at ages 8-9 years and a range of educational and social adjustment measures over the course of the Christchurch Health and Development Study, a 25-year longitudinal study of a birth cohort of 1,265 New Zealand children.\nIQ assessed at ages 8-9 years was related to a range of outcomes: later crime (offending, arrest/conviction); substance use disorders (nicotine dependence, illicit drug dependence); mental health (anxiety, suicidality); sexual adjustment (number of sexual partners, pregnancy); educational achievement (school leaving qualifications, tertiary qualifications); and occupational outcomes (unemployment, income). However, intelligence was largely unrelated to many of these outcomes: crime, mental health, sexual behaviours, and illicit substance dependence after statistical adjustment for early behaviour problems and family background. Strong relationships remained between childhood intelligence and later educational and occupational outcomes.\nMuch of the association between early intelligence and later social adjustment is mediated by childhood conduct problems and family social circumstances. However, strong relationships exist between early intelligence and later academic achievement and income independently of these factors.",

    "abstract": "In the field of physiological study of human intelligence, strong evidence of a more efficient operation (i.e., less activation) of the brain in brighter individuals (the neural efficiency hypothesis) can be found. Most studies in this field have used single, homogeneous tasks and have not examined sex differences. In analyzing the extent of Event-related Desynchronization (ERD) in the EEG during the performance of a verbal and a visuo-spatial task, we recently found that males and females display neural efficiency primarily in the domain where they usually perform better (i.e., verbal in females and spatial in males; cf. A.C. Neubauer, A. Fink, D.G. Schrausser, Intelligence and neural efficiency: the influence of task content and sex on brain-IQ relationship. Intelligence, 30 (2002) 515-536). However, this interpretation was complicated by differences in the complexity of the two tasks. By using a verbal (semantic) and a spatial (rotation) task of comparable complexity in this research, we sought to replicate and extend our earlier findings by additionally considering the individual differences in intelligence structure and the topographical distribution over the cortex. Findings were similar to the previous study: Females (n = 35) display neural efficiency (i.e., less brain activation in brighter individuals) primarily during the verbal task, males (n = 31) in the spatial task. However, the strength of this brain activation-IQ relationship varies with the intelligence factor: In males, the highest correlations were observed for spatial IQ, in females for verbal IQ. Furthermore, the sexes displayed topographical differences of neural efficiency patterns.",

    "abstract": "To identify the early life predictors of childhood intelligence.\nCohort study of 10 424 children who were born in Aberdeen (Scotland) between 1950 and 1956.\nSocial class of father around the time of birth, gravidity, maternal age, maternal physical condition, whether the child was born outside of marriage, prematurity, intrauterine growth, and childhood height were all independently associated with childhood intelligence at ages 7, 9, and 11. The effect of social class at birth was particularly pronounced, with a graded linear association across the distribution even with adjustment for all other covariates (p<0.001 for linear trend). Those from the lowest social class (V) had intelligence scores that were on average 0.9-1.0 of a standard deviation lower than those from the higher groups (I and II) at each of the three ages of intelligence testing. Collectively, the early life predictors that were examined explained 16% of the variation in intelligence at each age.\nFather's social class around the time of birth was an important predictor of childhood intelligence, even after adjustment for maternal characteristics and perinatal and childhood factors. Studies of the association of childhood intelligence with future adult disease need to ensure that the association is not fully explained by socioeconomic position.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether NART scores are associated with severity of brain injury and therefore presumably affected by brain injury. In addition, to compare the Cambridge Contextual Reading Test (CCRT) with injury severity in head-injured individuals.\nParticipants were 55 survivors of traumatic head injury, who completed the NART and the CCRT. The scores on these premorbid measures were then compared with indices of injury severity from their initial neurosurgical admission.\nThe NART was significantly correlated with Glasgow coma scale, with greater severity of injury associated with poorer performance. Poorer NART performance was also significantly more likely amongst those whose injury resulted in coma. The CCRT was preferred by patients, though it was also significantly associated with Glasgow coma scale and presence of coma.\nThe data suggest that performance on both the NART and the CCRT are affected by brain injury severity and thus may underestimate true premorbid ability in these individuals. Similar findings would be likely with the conceptually identical WTAR measure. These measures should be used with appropriate caution and may be usefully supplemented by predictions based on demographic information.",

Model-free multipoint linkage analysis revealed evidence of a significant quantitative-trait locus for performance IQ at 2q24.1-31.1 (LOD score 4.42), which overlaps the 2q21-33 region that has repeatedly shown linkage to autism. A second region revealed suggestive linkage for both full-scale and verbal IQs on 6p25.3-22.3 (LOD score 3.20 for full-scale IQ and 2.33 for verbal IQ), overlapping marginally with the 6p22.3-21.31 region implicated in reading disability and dyslexia.",

Reporting of infectious disease by occupational and specialist physicians is an important tool in the investigation of occupationally related infections and is relevant in their management.\nTo examine the reporting of cases of infectious disease by occupational and specialist physicians to schemes collecting data on occupational ill-health.\nCases of infectious disease reported by occupational and specialist physicians to the UK based schemes, Occupational Disease Intelligence Network (ODIN) and The Health and Occupation Reporting network (THOR), from 2000 to 2003 were analysed by reporting patterns, diagnosis, single case or outbreak reporting and industry.\nThe total number of estimated cases of infectious disease reported to ODIN and THOR from 2000 to 2003 was 5606; 74.9% cases were diarrhoeal disease, and 11.1% scabies. The majority (81.4%) of cases were reported in SIDAW, where the participation rate for reporters was 55%. Reporting rates were much higher in OPRA, SWORD and EPIDERM (ranging from 86 to 96%). The most frequently reported industrial sectors were social care (39.5%) and health (29.4%); while the manufacture of chemical products contributed 4.3% overall, but 33.8% to estimated cases in OPRA.\nDespite limitations related to under reporting, the occupational and specialist physician schemes in ODIN and THOR provide data that may be used to look at patterns of case reporting for occupational ill-health, including infectious disease. The reporting schemes also provide an important means of alerting peers about potential novel causes, precipitating factors, or industrial sectors associated with occupational disease.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence shows that event-related (upper) alpha desynchronization (ERD) is related to cognitive performance. Several studies observed a positive, some a negative relationship. The latter finding, interpreted in terms of the neural efficiency hypothesis, suggests that good performance is associated with a more 'efficient', smaller extent of cortical activation. Other studies found that ERD increases with semantic processing demands and that this increase is larger for good performers. Studies supporting the neural efficiency hypothesis used tasks that do not specifically require semantic processing. Thus, we assume that the lack of semantic processing demands may at least in part be responsible for the reduced ERD. In the present study we measured ERD during a difficult verbal-semantic task. The findings demonstrate that during semantic processing, more intelligent (as compared to less intelligent) subjects exhibited a significantly larger upper alpha ERD over the left hemisphere. We conclude that more intelligent subjects exhibit a more extensive activation in a semantic processing system and suggest that divergent findings regarding the neural efficiency hypotheses are due to task specific differences in semantic processing demands.",

    "abstract": "Although a 2-factor model has advanced research on the psychopathy construct, a 3-factor model was recently developed that emphasized pathological personality and eliminated antisocial behavior. However, dropping antisocial behavior from the psychopathy construct may not be advantageous. Using a large sample of psychiatric patients from the MacArthur Risk Assessment Study (J. Monahan & H. J. Steadman, 1994), the authors used confirmatory factor analysis to test a 4-factor model of psychopathy, which included interpersonal, affective, and behavioral impulsivity dimensions and an antisocial behavior dimension. Model fit was good for this 4-factor model, even when ethnicity, gender, and intelligence variables were included in the model. Structural equation modeling was used to compare the 3- and 4-factor models in predicting proximal (violence) and distal (intelligence) correlates of psychopathy.",

    "abstract": "'Primitive intelligence' in audition refers to the capacity of the auditory system to adaptatively model the acoustic regularity and react neurophysiologically to violations of such regularity, thus supporting the ability to predict future auditory events. In the present study, event-related brain potentials to pairs of tones were recorded in 11 human newborns to determine the infants' ability to extract an abstract acoustic rule, the direction of a frequency change. Most of the pairs (standard, P = 0.875) were of ascending frequency (i.e. the second tone higher than the first), while the remaining pairs (deviant, P = 0.125) were of descending frequency (the second tone being lower). Their frequencies varied among seven levels to prevent discrimination between standard and deviant pairs on the basis of absolute frequencies. We found that event-related brain potentials to deviant pairs differed in amplitude from those to standard pairs at 50-450 ms from the onset of the second tone of a pair, indicating the infants' ability to represent the abstract rule. This finding suggests the early ontogenetic origin of 'primitive intelligence' in audition that eventually may form a prerequisite for later language acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of cognitive performance earlier in life is essential in order to characterize precisely the extent to which these abilities have declined when an individual is diagnosed as having a dementing illness. The National Adult Reading Test (NART) was developed by Nelson and O'Connell to estimate premorbid intellectual ability in patients suffering from intellectual deterioration due to dementia. The test consists of 50 words, graded in difficulty, whose pronunciation cannot be determined from their spelling. The ability to successfully read irregularly spelt words is relatively robust in the face of current cognitive impairment and is a sensitive marker of intellectual attainment. Because the NART relies on orthographic irregularities in the English language, the construction of analogues of the test in other languages is not simply a matter of translation of the test content. Rather, words in the target language that have comparable properties to those in the NART must be sought. A French adaptation of the NART--the fNART--was developed by Bovet and calibrated on a small French-speaking Swiss sample. In a sample of 30 nondemented subjects, number of words pronounced correctly correlated highly with WAIS-R verbal and total IQ scores and less strongly with performance IQ (r = 0.43). Data available from an epidemiological survey undertaken in Geneva, Switzerland provided an opportunity to establish the measurement properties and construct validity of the fNART in a large sample unselected with respect to cognitive decline. In addition to the fNART, the survey incorporated a brief test battery assessing the domains of crystallized intelligence, memory and cognitive speed. An interview that enabled the diagnosis of dementia according to DSM IV criteria, the Mini Mental State Examination and the Psychogeriatric Assessment Scales (PAS) were also administered. If the fNART measures intellectual ability, substantial correlations between it and the test battery would be expected. Further validation of the test was sought by exploring its relation with years of education. The stability of the fNART was assessed by comparing the scores of subjects with and without dementia, and by examining the relationship of fNART scores to an informant-based report of change in cognitive performance from earlier in life assessed in the PAS. If the fNART is stable in the face of cognitive deterioration, no between-group differences or association with reported cognitive change would be expected.\nSubjects were randomly selected from residents of the canton of Geneva aged over 65 years. The analyses reported here were undertaken on a sample of 368 persons who gave codable responses to at least 90% of the fNART items. They ranged in age from 65 to 94 years. Subjects were interviewed in their homes by trained lay interviewers.\nCronbach's alpha for the forty-item scale was high (0.89). The percentage of subjects correctly pronouncing words ranged from 7.3% for \"chamsin\" to 96.7% for \"agenda\". Item response theory (IRT) models were fitted to the data. In a three-parameter model the value of the guessing (asymptote) parameter was vanishing small for all items. Accordingly, a two-parameter model was adopted. The discriminating power (slope) of items ranged considerably from 0.281 (r\u00e9bus) to 1.192 (b\u00e9otien). The average slope was 0.656. This corresponds to average factor loading of 0.528 (range 0.270 to 0.766.) The items measure a broad range of ability (mean threshold--0.719, sd = 1.540). Most items, however, discriminate at moderate levels. The parameter values obtained in the current study were compared to those estimated in a French sample of persons at risk of dementia . The correlation between item pairs for slope and parameter estimates was 0.53 and 0.70 respectively. This indicated substantial concordance between the samples regarding the difficulty of the items, but some differences in the power of groups to differentiate ability. In particular, a small number of words that performed very well in the \"at risk\" sample showed more moderate discrimination in the current study. Scores on the fNART were correlated with measures of crystallised intelligence, memory and cognitive speed. All correlations were statistically significant. With all tests entered a regression equation the multiple correlation coefficient was 0.63. Mean fNART scores of those suffering from DSM IV dementia and those meeting only Criterion A (multiple cognitive deficits) were lower than those of subjects meeting neither set of criteria. However subjects in the first two groups were older than subjects in the undemented group and had significantly lower educational attainment. When these two factors were controlled in an analysis of covariance, the magnitude of the differences between the groups, while still overall significantly different, was substantially reduced. A similar pattern of results applied when psychometric measures of cognitive state--the MMSE and the PAS Cognitive Impairment Scale--were used instead of diagnostic categories. The partial correlations of the fNART with the MMSE and PAS cognitive impairment scale controlling for age and education were 0.25 (P < 0.01) and -0.33 (P < 0.01) respectively. fNART scores did not differ between the sexes, nor were they significantly correlated with PAS Depression, Stroke or Behaviour Change scales. There was a small but significant correlation between the fNART and informant-assessed Cognitive Decline on the PAS.\nThis study demonstrated the excellent measurement properties of a French adaptation of the National Adult Reading Test in a large probability sample of elderly native speakers and provided the first large-sample evidence to support the validity of the fNART as a test of intellectual functioning relatively robust to dementia status. The negligible values of the pseudo-guessing parameters suggest that the goal of choosing words whose pronunciation is not susceptible to guessing has been achieved. The average item discriminability was high and the words used covered the spectrum of ability. The finding of substantial relationships of cognitive performance and educational attainment with fNART scores is important in validating the test as a measure of premorbid cognitive ability. The low correlations of the fNART with informant-based assessment of cognitive decline and age support the fNART as being relative robust to decline in ability. The relationships observed in this French adaptation are comparable to those reported for the English instrument . However, subjects meeting DSM IV criteria for dementia or Criterion A only had lower scores than other subjects. Decline in NART scores with dementia has been observed, particularly in moderate and severe cases. Given that the mechanism of the fNART is the same as the NART it is to be expected that while generally robust to current dementia status, some decline in performance will occur with the progression of the disease. The relationships between the fNART and PAS scales was remarkably similar to those reported by Jorm et al. in an English-speaking sample between the PAS and NART. Although small, the correlation between the fNART and the PAS Cognitive Decline scale might have been expected to be non-significant if the measure were truly stable in the face of intellectual deterioration. However this correlation is mirrored in the original English instruments and may reflect the higher risk of dementia in persons of lower intellectual ability.\nFurther research is desirable to improve the precision of the calibration of the scale against the WAIS-R. Nevertheless, this study has demonstrated that the fNART is a reliable and valid method of assessing premorbid intellectual ability in French speakers.",

The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the relationship between different domains of EI, and initial response to a simplified non-surgical treatment protocol in 29 patients with chronic periodontitis.\nAssessment of patients included socio-demographic and behavioural variables and assessment of EI. Clinical assessment included measurement of plaque and gingival bleeding. Patients received oral hygiene instruction (OHI) and supra-gingival scaling and polishing over two visits, and re-assessed after 3 weeks.\nThere was a significant overall reduction in plaque and bleeding. Plaque reduction was positively associated with the EI construct of intentionality, resilience, constructive discontent and personal power (Spearman's rank test). Reduction in bleeding was positively correlated with resilience, constructive discontent and intuition.\nThis pilot study demonstrated an association between EI domains and short-term changes in plaque and bleeding, and suggest that initial responses to standardized periodontal treatment may be partly related to EI.",

Although sociologists have virtually removed it from the list of possible factors influencing crime, the impact of IQ on crime continues to generate a significant amount of scientific research and a substantial number of publications. The purpose of this study is to assess intellectual levels and to compare two groups of incarcerated criminals. Using MANCOVA and ANCOVA procedures, 261 sex offenders and 150 non-sexual violent criminals were compared on IQ subscales. The results show significant differences on vocabulary, comprehension, arithmetic, mental math computations, object assembly, letter-number sequencing, and perception subscales, as well as on performance IQ and total IQ.

    "abstract": "Researchers have long attempted to determine brain correlates of intelligence using available neuroimaging technology including CT, MRI, PET, and fMRI. Although structural and functional imaging techniques are well suited to assess gross cortical regions associated with intelligence, the integrity and functioning of underlying white matter networks critical to coordinated cortical integration remain comparatively understudied. A relatively recent neuroimaging advance is magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) which allows for interrogation of biochemical substrates of brain structure and function in vivo. In this study, we examined twenty-seven normal control subjects (17 male, 10 female) to determine whether N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a metabolite found primarily within neurons, is related to intelligence as assessed by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III. Of the three white matter regions studied (i.e., left frontal, right frontal, left occipito-parietal), we found that a model including only left occipito-parietal white matter predicted intellectual performance [F(1,25) = 8.65, P = .007; r2 = .26], providing regional specificity to our previous findings of NAA-IQ relationships. Moreover, we found that a complex combination of left frontal and left occipito-parietal NAA strongly predicted performance in women, but not men [F(2,7) = 21.84, P < .001; adjusted r2 = .82]. Our results highlight a biochemical substrate of normal intellectual performance, mediated by sex, within white matter association fibers linking posterior to frontal brain regions.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this research is to compute a prediction of the future intelligence of every neonate with a meningomyelocele (MMC) on the day of birth to inform the parents. Earlier research revealed that the variables ventricle size, open arch above vertebra lumbar 3, a very small or a very large head can be attended by an IQ below 85 points: the turning point between dependence and independence.\nUntil now no research has been done combining the values of influencing variables in one equation. Our study used the equation of multiple longitudinal linear regression. For reference, data from the files of 148 neonates born in the years 1960-1980 were compared with those of Dutch children sampled by Verger. The working hypothesis that the IQ level is directly related to congenital deformities of the nervous system needs to be tested. As standard the values of variables at birth, the head circumference and length, the size of the ventricles and the highest open vertebral arch, are to be used.\nThe Wisc-R of the MMC cohort had a mean of 84 points and 55% had an IQ above 85. The correlation computation of the values of all available variables with the values of the measured Wisc-R revealed the significance of the neuroanatomical variables, size of ventricle and level of the highest open vertebral arch and for the anthropomorphic variables Length and Length/Circumference. To establish the relationship between the Wisc-R value and the values of the significant variables an equation with the multiple linear regression method was used. The measured IQ is made dependent on the significant variables size of ventricle, level of highest open arch and quotient Length by Circumference. This equation produces a value called predicted IQ. The predicted IQ was 92%, the same or nearly the same as the measured Wisc-R IQ.\nThis conformity of the measured IQ and the predicted IQ proves the possibility of using these birth data for prediction.",

    "abstract": "Psychometric review of 33 peer-reviewed studies of six self-report emotional intelligence (EI) measures supports a multidimensional conceptualization of EI. The nature and number of EI facets, however, and their distinctiveness from more established trait domains is unclear. Building on earlier efforts, three studies were undertaken (Ns = 138, 163, 152) to develop self-report measures of 10 facets of EI proposed by Salovey and Mayer (1990). Results support the reliability (internal consistency, test-retest) and validity (content, criterion, construct, structural) of the proposed scales and their distinctiveness among themselves and with respect to more established trait domains (e.g., personality). Specifically, three satisfaction and four cross-cultural adaptability facets were predicted uniquely by 9 of the 10 proposed subscales, controlling for social desirability, the Big Five, positive and negative affect, and self-monitoring. All told, results confirm that trait-EI can be measured using self-report and conceptualized as a distinct multidimensional domain.",

    "abstract": "The genomic matching technique (GMT) targets duplicated polymorphic sequences within genomic blocks in the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC), differentiating between individuals at the DNA level using a single primer pair per block. The GMT is currently used to supplement human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing to match donor and recipient pairs for bone marrow transplantation and has the potential to be employed as a powerful exclusion tool in forensic biology. The GMT is highly reproducible, produces DNA profiles from less than 1 ng of DNA and was successfully employed to profile a range of forensic samples including buccal swabs, handled objects and fingerprints. Furthermore, GMT profiles from a single genomic block in the MHC are likely to be more discriminatory than known highly polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) loci such as ACTBP2. As such, the GMT can reduce the cost of investigations that require profiling of multiple suspects or samples from one or more crime scenes and could be extended to profile genomic blocks in other polymorphic genetic systems in the human genome.",

    "abstract": "To propose a novel approach of incorporating ambient intelligence in the health grid security architecture.\nSecurity concerns are severely impeding the grid community effort in spreading its wings in health applications. In this paper, we have proposed a high level approach to incorporate ambient intelligence for health grid security architecture and have argued that this will significantly improve the current state of the grid security paradigm with an enhanced user-friendly environment. We believe that the time is right to shift the onus of traditional security mechanisms onto the new technologies. The incorporation of ambient intelligence in the security architecture of a grid will not only render a security paradigm robust but also provide an attractive vision for the future of computing by bringing the two worlds together.\nIn this article we propose an evolutionary approach of utilizing smart devices for grid security architecture. We argue that such an infrastructure will impart unique features to the existing grid security paradigms by offering fortified and relentless monitoring. This new security architecture will be comprehensive in nature but will not be cumbersome for the users due to its typical characteristics of not prying into their lives and adapting to their needs.\nWe have identified a new paradigm of the security architecture for a health grid that will not only render a security mechanism robust but will also provide the high levels of user-friendliness. As our approach is a first contribution to this problem, a number of other issues for future research remain open. However, the prospects are fascinating.",

    "abstract": "Computer algorithms can only produce seemingly random or pseudorandom numbers whereas certain natural phenomena, such as the decay of radioactive particles, can be utilized to produce truly random numbers. In this study, the ability of humans to generate random numbers was tested in healthy adults. Subjects were simply asked to generate and dictate random numbers. Generated numbers were tested for uniformity, independence and information density. The results suggest that humans can generate random numbers that are uniformly distributed, independent of one another and unpredictable. If humans can generate sequences of random numbers then neural networks or forms of artificial intelligence, which are purported to function in ways essentially the same as the human brain, should also be able to generate sequences of random numbers. Elucidating the precise mechanism by which humans generate random number sequences and the underlying neural substrates may have implications in the cognitive science of decision-making. It is possible that humans use their random-generating neural machinery to make difficult decisions in which all expected outcomes are similar. It is also possible that certain people, perhaps those with neurological or psychiatric impairments, are less able or unable to generate random numbers. If the random-generating neural machinery is employed in decision making its impairment would have profound implications in matters of agency and free will.",

    "abstract": "Recent literature has focused on the reduction of laboratory errors and the potential impact on patient management. This study assessed the intelligent, automated preanalytical process-control abilities in newer generation analyzers as compared with older analyzers and the impact on error reduction. Three generations of immuno-chemistry analyzers were challenged with pooled human serum samples for a 3-week period. One of the three analyzers had an intelligent process of fluidics checks, including bubble detection. Bubbles can cause erroneous results due to incomplete sample aspiration. This variable was chosen because it is the most easily controlled sample defect that can be introduced. Traditionally, lab technicians have had to visually inspect each sample for the presence of bubbles. This is time consuming and introduces the possibility of human error. Instruments with bubble detection may be able to eliminate the human factor and reduce errors associated with the presence of bubbles. Specific samples were vortexed daily to introduce a visible quantity of bubbles, then immediately placed in the daily run. Errors were defined as a reported result greater than three standard deviations below the mean and associated with incomplete sample aspiration of the analyte of the individual analyzer Three standard deviations represented the target limits of proficiency testing. The results of the assays were examined for accuracy and precision. Efficiency, measured as process throughput, was also measured to associate a cost factor and potential impact of the error detection on the overall process. The analyzer performance stratified according to their level of internal process control The older analyzers without bubble detection reported 23 erred results. The newest analyzer with bubble detection reported one specimen incorrectly. The precision and accuracy of the nonvortexed specimens were excellent and acceptable for all three analyzers. No errors were found in the nonvortexed specimens. There were no significant differences in overall process time for any of the analyzers when tests were arranged in an optimal configuration. The analyzer with advanced fluidic intelligence demostrated the greatest ability to appropriately deal with an incomplete aspiration by not processing and reporting a result for the sample. This study suggests that preanalytical process-control capabilities could reduce errors. By association, it implies that similar intelligent process controls could favorably impact the error rate and, in the case of this instrument, do it without negatively impacting process throughput. Other improvements may be realized as a result of having an intelligent error-detection process including further reduction in misreported results, fewer repeats, less operator intervention, and less reagent waste.",

    "abstract": "It has been conjectured that the cognitive basis of intelligence is the ability to make fluid or creative analogical relationships between distantly related concepts or pieces of information (Hofstadter, D.R. 1995. Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies. Basic Books, New York., Hofstadter, D.R. 2001. Analogy as the Core of Cognition. In The Analogical Mind: Perspectives from Cognitive Science (D. Gentner, K. J. Holyoak and B. N. Kokinov, Ed.). pp. 504-537. MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass.). We hypothesised that fluid analogy-making tasks would activate specific regions of frontal cortex that were common to those of previous inferential reasoning tasks. We report here a novel self-paced event-related fMRI study employed to investigate the neural correlates of intelligence associated with undertaking fluid letter string analogy tasks. Stimuli were adapted from items of the AI program Copycat (Mitchell, M. 1993. Analogy-making as Perception: A computer model. The MIT Press, Cambridge MA.). Twelve right-handed adults chose their own \"best\" completions from four plausible response choices to 55 fluid letter string analogies across a range of analogical depths. An analysis using covariates determined per subject by analogical depth revealed significant bilateral neural activations in the superior, inferior, and middle frontal gyri and in the anterior cingulate/paracingulate cortex. These frontal areas have been previously associated with reasoning tasks involving inductive syllogisms, syntactic hierarchies, and linguistic creativity. A higher-order analysis covarying participants' verbal intelligence measures found correlations with individual BOLD activation strengths in two ROIs within BA 9 and BA 45/46. This is a provocative result given that verbal intelligence is conceptualised as being a measure of crystallised intelligence, while analogy making is conceptualised as requiring fluid intelligence. The results therefore support the conjecture that fluid analogising could underpin general intellectual performance.",

    "abstract": "A robust association between advancing paternal age and schizophrenia risk is reported, and genetic changes in the germ cells of older men are presumed to underlie the effect. If that is so, then the pathway may include effects on cognition, as those with premorbid schizophrenia are reported to have lower intelligence. There are also substantial genetic influences on intelligence, so de novo genetic events in male germ cells, which accompany advancing paternal age, may plausibly influence offspring intelligence.\nAn association of paternal age with IQ in healthy adolescents may illuminate the mechanisms that link it to schizophrenia.\nWe examined the association of paternal age and IQ scores using the Israeli Army Board data on 44 175 individuals from a richly described birth cohort, along with maternal age and other potential modifiers.\nA significant inverted U-shaped relationship was observed between paternal age and IQ scores, which was independent from a similar association of IQ scores with maternal age. These relationships were not significantly attenuated by controlling for multiple possible confounding factors, including the other parent's age, parental education, social class, sex and birth order, birth weight and birth complications. Overall, parental age accounted for approximately 2% of the total variance in IQ scores, with later paternal age lowering non-verbal IQ scores more than verbal IQ scores.\nWe found independent effects of maternal and paternal age on offspring IQ scores. The paternal age effect may be explained by de novo mutations or abnormal methylation of paternally imprinted genes, whereas maternal age may affect fetal neurodevelopment through age-related alterations in the in-utero environment. The influence of late paternal age to modify non-verbal IQ may be related to the pathways that increase the risk for schizophrenia in the offspring of older fathers.",

    "abstract": "Several studies on the relationship between event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) and cognitive performance revealed contradictory results particularly for the alpha band. Studies from our laboratory have shown that good performers show a larger upper alpha ERD (interpreted in terms of larger cortical activation) than bad performers. In contrast, other researchers found evidence for the neural efficiency hypothesis, which states that more intelligent subjects exhibit a smaller extent of cortical activation, which is assumed to be reflected by a smaller upper alpha ERD. Here we address the question whether these divergent results may be due to differences in general task difficulty. Using a modified version of the RAVEN, individually divided into easy and difficult tasks, a group of average and a group of highly intelligent subjects (IQ- and IQ+) have been investigated. While in the theta frequency IQ+ subjects generally exhibited a significantly stronger activation, we found a significant interaction of task difficulty and IQ group in the upper alpha band, indicating both, a weaker activation for the high IQ group during the easy tasks, and a significant increase from easy to difficult tasks for IQ+ only.",

    "abstract": "To study the relationship between seizure-related factors, non-verbal intelligence, and socio-economic status (SES) in a population-based sample of children with epilepsy.\nThe latest ILAE International classifications of epileptic seizures and syndromes were used to classify seizure types and epileptic syndromes in all 6-12 year old children (N=198) with epilepsy in Hordaland County, Norway. The children had neuropediatric and EEG examinations. Of the 198 patients, demographic characteristics were collected on 183 who participated in psychological studies including Raven matrices. 126 healthy controls underwent the same testing. Severe non-verbal problems (SNVP) were defined as a Raven score at or <10th percentile.\nChildren with epilepsy were highly over-represented in the lowest Raven percentile group, whereas controls were highly over-represented in the higher percentile groups. SNVP were present in 43% of children with epilepsy and 3% of controls. These problems were especially common in children with remote symptomatic epilepsy aetiology, undetermined epilepsy syndromes, myoclonic seizures, early seizure debut, high seizure frequency and in children with polytherapy. Seizure-related characteristics that were not usually associated with SNVP were idiopathic epilepsies, localization related (LR) cryptogenic epilepsies, absence and simple partial seizures, and a late debut of epilepsy. Adjusting for socio-economic status factors did not significantly change results.\nIn childhood epilepsy various seizure-related factors, but not SES factors, were associated with the presence or absence of SNVP. Such deficits may be especially common in children with remote symptomatic epilepsy aetiology and in complex and therapy resistant epilepsies. Low frequencies of SNVP may be found in children with idiopathic and LR cryptogenic epilepsy syndromes, simple partial or absence seizures and a late epilepsy debut. Our study contributes to an overall picture of cognitive function and its relation to central seizure characteristics in a childhood epilepsy population and can be useful for the follow-up team in developing therapy strategies that meet the individual needs of the child with epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "In 1965, McCay Vernon drove a stake through the heart of the long-established \"truth\" that deaf people were inferior to hearing people. Launched by Aristotle, emboldened by the 1880 Conference of Milan, and reiterated in the twentieth century through the biased research of many psychologists, this falsehood persisted until the publication of this classic review paper. Vernon succinctly spotlights biases in IQ assessment of deaf children resulting from improper testing methods, research participant sampling, even the experience level of the evaluators themselves. Brief and scholarly, the paper had enormous impact not only on future research regarding cognition and deaf people but on clinical practice as well. Within this paper, insights are evident which Vernon has continued to elucidate throughout his long career. He was arguably the first psychologist to view the deaf population as a heterogeneous one, noting how various hearing loss etiologies differentially affect cognition and other psychological characteristics. His later research, notably that which focused on rubella, deafblind, and deaf forensic populations, has been similarly pioneering. McCay Vernon's extensive professional impact stems not only from his prolific, readily applied research work but also from his generous and vigorous activities as a teacher, a mentor, and advisor. - Robert Q.

Participants thought themselves slightly less bright than their fathers (2 IQ points) but brighter than their mothers (6 points), their grandfathers (8 points), but especially their grandmothers (11 points). Regressions showed that participants thought verbal and mathematical IQ to be the best predictors of overall IQ. Results were broadly in agreement with other studies in the area. A comparison was also made with British data using the same questionnaire. British participants tended to give significantly higher self-estimates than for relatives, though the pattern was generally similar. Results are discussed in terms of the studies in the field.",

    "abstract": "Participating in the study were 30 respondents, who could be clustered as high-average verbal/performance intelligent (HIQ/AIQ), or emotionally intelligent (HEIQ/AEIQ). The EEG was recorded while students were performing two tasks: the Raven's advanced progressive matrices (RAPM), and identifying emotions in pictures (IDEM). Significant differences in event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) related to verbal/performance intelligence were only observed while respondents solved the RAPM. The HIQ and AIQ groups displayed temporal and spatial differently induced gamma band activity. Significant differences in ERD/ERS related to emotional intelligence were only observed for the IDEM task. HEIQ individuals displayed more gamma band ERS and less upper alpha band ERD than did AEIQ individuals. It can be concluded that HIQ and HEIQ individuals employed more adequate strategies for solving the problems at hand. The results further suggest that emotional intelligence and verbal/performance intelligence represent distinct components of the cognitive architecture.",

    "abstract": "Intelligence has evolved many times independently among vertebrates. Primates, elephants and cetaceans are assumed to be more intelligent than 'lower' mammals, the great apes and humans more than monkeys, and humans more than the great apes. Brain properties assumed to be relevant for intelligence are the (absolute or relative) size of the brain, cortex, prefrontal cortex and degree of encephalization. However, factors that correlate better with intelligence are the number of cortical neurons and conduction velocity, as the basis for information-processing capacity. Humans have more cortical neurons than other mammals, although only marginally more than whales and elephants. The outstanding intelligence of humans appears to result from a combination and enhancement of properties found in non-human primates, such as theory of mind, imitation and language, rather than from 'unique' properties.",

    "abstract": "Occupational health nurses are in the unique position to influence health in the work force. To maximize this positive health influence, occupational health nurses should develop the skills of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence includes awareness of self and others and empathy. These behaviors are congruent with the mission of nursing because they improve health outcomes. Occupational health nurses who are emotionally intelligent have improved relationships with others, an important aspect of the nursing role. Emotional intelligence can be developed. The process begins with self-awareness, enhanced through self-care behaviors, such as exercise and journaling. Reading popular self-help literature also can improve self-awareness. After a nurse becomes self-aware, the next phase is to develop an awareness of others. This can be learned using the same type of techniques in the self-awareness stage. The final step is the development of empathy. This is the active step using the knowledge developed in the prior two stages. Through discipline and effort, an individual can learn to actively listen to others. This type of listening fosters empathy. By working in a positive, caring environment, personal growth in emotional intelligence can be enhanced (McMullen, 2003). Through the development of emotional intelligence, the nurse can improve personally and professionally, a win-win situation for all involved.",

    "abstract": "We investigated whether a relationship exists between frontal lobe volume and fluid intelligence as measured by both Cattell's Culture Fair test and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Performance scale, but not with crystallized intelligence as measured by the WAIS-R Verbal scale, in healthy adults, using two well-established image analysis techniques applied to high-resolution MR brain images. Firstly, using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), we investigated whether a significant relationship exists between gray matter concentration and fluid intelligence on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Secondly, we applied the Cavalieri method of modern design stereology in combination with point counting to investigate possible relationships between macroscopic volumes of relevant brain regions defined as dorsolateral, dorsomedial, orbitolateral, and orbitomedial prefrontal cortex on the basis of neuroanatomical landmarks, and fluid intelligence. We also examined the effect on these relationships of normalizing regional brain volumes to intracranial volume. VBM analysis revealed a positive correlation between gray matter concentration in the medial region of prefrontal cortex and Culture Fair scores (corrected for multiple comparisons), and also WAIS-R Performance Intelligence sum of scaled scores (SSS) (uncorrected for multiple comparisons before controlling for age, and this converges with the stereological finding of the positive correlation between volume of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex normalized to intracranial volume and Culture Fair scores after controlling for age. WAIS-R Verbal Intelligence SSS showed no correlations. We interpret our findings, from independent analyses of both VBM and stereology, as evidence of the importance of medial prefrontal cortex in supporting fluid intelligence.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate four therapeutic measures on acute tetramethylene disulphotetramine (TETS) poisoning and the effects of it on intelligence of children.\nAll 86 patients of acute TETS poisoning were randomly divided into 4 groups (the control group, sodium valproate group, sodium dimercaptopropane sulfonate group and the hemoperfusion group). The therapeutic effects were observed after the arranged treatment was administrated. According to age, residence, sex, education and domestic economy, 30 children were matched by 1:1 with children of TETS poisoning.\nThe termination time of seizure, doses of diazepam, mental symptoms and the continual time of mental symptoms were not significantly different among these three groups. After hemoperfusion, the seizure of patients was terminated or the frequency was obviously decreased, but the level of TETS in blood was not reduced. The average scores of full intelligence quotient (FIQ), the verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ) and the performance intelligence quotient (PIQ) of children in poisoning group were 9.1, 8.8 and 7.7 less than the controls. The average scores of FIQ of children with bad state were 15 less than the controls.\nTherapeutic effects of sodium valproate and sodium dimercaptopropane sulfonate on acute TETS poisoning should be not better than using diazepam and sodium phenobarbital. Therapeutic effects of hemoperfusion on TETS poisoning is good. TETS poisoning should have a great influence on intelligence of children.",

    "abstract": "Associations among cognitive ability, socioeconomic position, and health have been interpreted to imply that cognitive ability could explain social inequalities in health. The authors test this hypothesis by examining three questions: Is cognitive ability related to health? To what extent does it explain social inequalities in health? Do measures of socioeconomic position and cognitive ability have independent associations with health? Relative indices of inequality were used to estimate associations, using data from the Whitehall II study (baseline, 1985-1988), a British prospective cohort study (4,158 men and 1,680 women). Cognitive ability was significantly related to coronary heart disease, physical functioning, and self-rated health in both sexes and additionally to mental functioning in men. It explained some of the relation between socioeconomic position and health: 17% for coronary heart disease, 33% for physical functioning, 12% for mental functioning, and 39% for self-rated health. In analysis simultaneously adjusted for all measures of socioeconomic position, cognitive ability retained an independent association only with physical functioning in women. These results suggest that, although cognitive ability is related to health, it does not explain social inequalities in health.",

Physical examination revealed mild facial weakness, a bell-shaped chest cavity, kyphosis, winging of the scapula, and hypotonia of the shoulder girdle. Muscle biopsy demonstrated prominent variation in fiber size and central nuclei and numerous subsarcolemmal particles on modified Gomori trichrome stains. Electron microscopy depicted areas of disrupted sarcomeres with abnormal aggregates. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed mild widening of the lateral ventricles and an enlarged cisterna magna.

    "abstract": "In many manufacturing environments, automated guided vehicles are used to move the processed materials between various pickup and delivery points. The assignment of vehicles to unit loads is a complex problem that is often solved in real-time with simple dispatching rules. This paper proposes an automated guided vehicles dispatching approach based on computational intelligence. We adopt a fuzzy multicriteria decision strategy to simultaneously take into account multiple aspects in every dispatching decision. Since the typical short-term view of dispatching rules is one of the main limitations of such real-time assignment heuristics, we also incorporate in the multicriteria algorithm a specific heuristic rule that takes into account the empty-vehicle travel on a longer time-horizon. Moreover, we also adopt a genetic algorithm to tune the weights associated to each decision criteria in the global decision algorithm. The proposed approach is validated by means of a comparison with other dispatching rules, and with other recently proposed multicriteria dispatching strategies also based on computational Intelligence. The analysis of the results obtained by the proposed dispatching approach in both nominal and perturbed operating conditions (congestions, faults) confirms its effectiveness.",

Cattell's Culture Fair Intelligence Test was used to asses the nonverbal intelligence (IQ) of subjects. The motor median nerve conduction velocity from right hand of males was positively correlated with IQ. In subjects with no familial sinistrality (FS-), the motor ulnar-nerve conduction velocity from the right and left hands of males negatively correlated with IQ; there were inverse correlations between IQ and nerve conduction velocity (motor median nerve from right, sensory median nerve from right and left) in females. In subjects with familial sinistrality (FS+), IQ directly correlated with nerve conduction velocity from motor median (right and left), sensory median (right), and motor ulnar (right) nerves, but only in males. The speed hypothesis and neurological theory of intelligence were not supported by these results, which, in contrast, emphasized the importance of sex and familial sinistrality in any theory of intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Genome sequencing has revealed that signal transduction in bacteria makes use of a limited number of different devices, such as two-component systems, LuxI-LuxR quorum-sensing systems, phosphodiesterases, Ser-Thr (serine-threonine) kinases, OmpR-type regulators, and sigma factor-anti-sigma factor pathways. These systems use modular proteins with a large variety of input and output domains, yet strikingly conserved transmission domains. This conservation might lead to redundancy of output function, for example, via crosstalk (i.e. phosphoryl transfer from a non-cognate sensory kinase). The number of similar devices in a single cell, particularly of the two-component type, might amount to several dozen, and most of these operate in parallel. This could bestow bacteria with cellular intelligence if the network of two-component systems in a single cell fulfils the requirements of a neural network. Testing these ideas poses a great challenge for prokaryotic systems biology.",

    "abstract": "In 2001, Julian Savulescu wrote an article entitled 'Procreative Beneficence: Why We Should Select the Best Children', in which he argued for the genetic selection of intelligence in children. That article contributes to a debate on whether genetic research on intelligence should be undertaken at all and, if so, should intelligence selection be available to potential parents. As such, the question of intelligence selection relates to wider issues concerning the genetic determinism of behavioural traits, i.e. alcoholism. This article is designed as an engagement in the intelligence selection debate using an analysis of Savulescu's arguments to raise a series of problematic issues in relation to the ethics of parental selection of intelligence. These problematic issues relate to wider assumptions that are made in order to put forward intelligence selection as a viable ethical option. Such assumptions are more generic in character, but still relate to Savulescu's article, concerning issues of genetic determinism, private allocation and inequality, and, finally, individual versus aggregate justice. The conclusion focuses on what the implications are for the question of agency, especially if intelligence selection is allowed.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the relationship between health managers' self-assessed empathy, their leadership behaviours as rated by their staff, and staff's personal ratings on a range of work satisfaction and related outcome measures. Empathy was conceived of as four distinct but related individual dispositions, namely empathic concern (EC), perspective taking (PT), personal distress (PD) and empathic matching (EM). Results showed three empathy scales (EC, PT and EM) were, as postulated, positively related to transformational behaviour (inspiring followers to achieve more than expected). The same three measures, also as expected, showed no relationship to transactional behaviour (motivating followers to achieve expected results) and were negatively associated with laissez-faire leadership (an absence of leadership style). Relationships between empathy scales and outcome measures were selective and moderate in size. Strongest empathy association was evident between the PT scale and most outcome measures. Conversely, the extra effort outcome appeared most sensitive to the range of empathy scales. Where significant relationships did exist between empathy and outcome, leadership behaviour was in all cases a perfect mediator. Whilst not denying the smaller dispositional effects on leadership outcomes, leadership behaviour itself, rather than individual traits such as empathy, appear to be major influencing factors in leadership effectiveness.",

An academic achievement of two years below the actual grade placement on educational assessment with a Curriculum-Based test was considered diagnostic of SpLD. On basis of their nonverbal Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores obtained on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children test, the study children were divided into three groups: (i) average-nonverbal intelligence group (IQ 90-109), (ii) bright normal-nonverbal intelligence group (IQ 110-119), and (iii) superior-nonverbal intelligence group (IQ 120-129). A battery of 13 Cognition Function tests (CFTs) devised by Jnana Prabodhini's Institute of Psychology, Pune based on Guilford's Structure of Intellect Model was administered individually on each child in the four areas of information viz. figural, symbolic, semantic and behavioral.\nThe mean CFTs scores obtained in the four areas of information were calculated for each of the three groups and compared using one-way analysis of variance test. A P value < 0.05 was to be considered statistically significant.\nThere were no statistically significant differences between their mean CFTs scores in any of the four areas of information.\nCognition abilities are similar in children with SpLD having average, bright-normal and superior nonverbal intelligence.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the predictive accuracy of short forms of the Wechsler intelligence scales for individuals with high functioning autism. Several short forms were derived from participants who had received the full procedure. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed to determine the strength of association between the subtests included in the short form and IQ scores based upon the full test. These analyses were performed for all participants, and also for autism participants with atypical subtest profiles. In all analyses the percentages of explained variance were typically in the .8-.9 range. It was concluded that short forms may be used with good predictive accuracy in individuals with high functioning autism, even when the subtest profile is atypical.",

    "abstract": "This study explored the correlations of scores on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III in screening language problems and scores on the three Comprehensive Receptive and Expressive Vocabulary Test subscales. Participants were 243 students ages 6 to 17 years in Grades K-11 who were identified as learning disabled, learning disabled with speech impairment, mentally retarded, and speech impaired. Analysis indicated strong correlations between the two measures, particularly between the CREVT General Vocabulary and WISC-III Verbal IQ (r = .80), WISC-III Verbal Comprehension Index (r =.83), and the Vocabulary subtest (r =.76). These results held across the grades. Supporting earlier studies of relationships of Verbal IQ and Receptive Vocabulary, correlations were lower between participants in Grades K through 2 than those in higher grades on the WISC-III Verbal IQ and the Receptive Vocabulary subtest. An analysis of the accuracy of the WISC-III for classifying students with language problems indicated improvement in classification over chance. These findings suggest that the WISC-III may be an effective screen for language problems.",

The intelligence of SLI children is in the normal range, while their language abilities are impaired. \"Normal intelligence\", the defining feature of SLI is questioned in this study.\nUsing IDIS (an inventory of diagnostic information in language impairment), we examined 138 children aged 5 and 6 years with severe language impairment; 108 SLI and 30 LI children. Various indicators of speech and language such as articulation, the ability to discriminate sounds, lexicon, grammar and pragmatic abilities but also auditory and visual perception, auditory and visual memory, fine and gross motor function were assessed.\nThe performance of the SLI children was significantly higher in most of the tests than that of the LI children. Factor analysis showed that the two groups also differed in the structure of performance. Auditory short-term memory was reduced in most children irrespective of intelligence.\nWe propose the retention of the differentiation of subgroups of developmental speech and language disorders depending on the level of intelligence.",

    "abstract": "There has been considerable progress in the design of vaccines capable of safely and effectively inducing CD8(+) T cells for prophylaxis and treatment of chronic infectious diseases and cancer. Much of what is known about CD8(+) T cell-mediated immunity has come from pioneering work in mice; this broad overview discusses recent work in mouse systems where lessons may be drawn for human vaccine development. The areas highlighted include antivector immunity, immunodominance, dendritic cell biology and targeting, the role of Toll-like receptors and their exploitation by novel adjuvants, the role of CD4(+) T cell help, regulatory T cells and, finally, some comments on the different requirements of prophylactic versus therapeutic vaccines.",

    "abstract": "The present study explores 2 key variables in social metacognition: perceived intelligence and perceived levels of knowledge about a specific content domain. The former represents a judgment of one's knowledge at an abstract level, whereas the latter represents a judgment of one's knowledge in a specific content domain. Data from interviews of approximately 8,411 female adolescents from a national sample were analyzed in a 2-wave panel design with a year between assessments. Higher levels of perceived intelligence at Wave 1 were associated with a lower probability of the occurrence of a pregnancy over the ensuing year independent of actual IQ, self-esteem, and academic aspirations. Higher levels of perceived knowledge about the accurate use of birth control were associated with a higher probability of the occurrence of a pregnancy independent of actual knowledge about accurate use, perceived intelligence, self-esteem, and academic aspirations.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive deficits in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are well demonstrated, but the pathophysiology of these deficits is still controversial, as the relationship between OSA severity and cognitive deficits is usually weak. Our study considers the possible relationship between OSA-related cognitive deficits and the overall intellectual function of OSA patients. Forty-seven OSA patients and 36 normal individuals underwent a neuropsychological battery test assessing attention and alertness. According to the resulting IQ score, patients and controls were divided into a high-intelligence group (IQ > or = 90th percentile) and a normal-intelligence group (50 < or = IQ < 90%ile). Between the two patient groups there were no significant differences noticed, regarding OSA severity or sleepiness. High-intelligence patients showed the same attention/alertness performance compared with the high-intelligence controls. On the contrary, patients with normal-intelligence showed attention/alertness decline compared with the normal-intelligence control group. The two patient groups were re-examined with the same battery test after at least 1 year of CPAP treatment. At re-examination neither patient group showed any differences regarding attention and alertness compared with the control groups. We assume that high-intelligence may have a protective effect against OSA-related cognitive decline, perhaps due to increased cognitive reserve.",

The aim of this study is to generate tissue engineering schemes with artificial intelligence instead of human intelligence. The experimental data of tissue engineered cartilage were integrated and standardized with a centralized database, and a scheme engine was developed using artificial intelligent methods (artificial neural networks and decision trees). The scheme engine was trained with existing cases in the database, and then was used to generate tissue engineering schemes for new experimental animals. Following the schemes generated by the artificial intelligent system, we cured 18 of the 20 experimental animals. In conclusion, artificial intelligence is a powerful method for decision making in the tissue engineering realm.",

    "abstract": "Estimation and Assessment of Substance Exposure (EASE) is an artificial intelligence program developed by UK's Health and Safety Executive to assess exposure. EASE computes estimated airborne concentrations based on a substance's vapor pressure and the types of controls in the work area. Though EASE is intended only to make broad predictions of exposure from occupational environments, some occupational hygienists might attempt to use EASE for individual exposure characterizations. This study investigated whether EASE would accurately predict actual sampling results from a chemical manufacturing process. Personal breathing zone time-weighted average (TWA) monitoring data for two volatile organic chemicals--a common solvent (toluene) and a specialty monomer (chloroprene)--present in this manufacturing process were compared to EASE-generated estimates. EASE-estimated concentrations for specific tasks were weighted by task durations reported in the monitoring record to yield TWA estimates from EASE that could be directly compared to the measured TWA data. Two hundred and six chloroprene and toluene full-shift personal samples were selected from eight areas of this manufacturing process. The Spearman correlation between EASE TWA estimates and measured TWA values was 0.55 for chloroprene and 0.44 for toluene, indicating moderate predictive values for both compounds. For toluene, the interquartile range of EASE estimates at least partially overlapped the interquartile range of the measured data distributions in all process areas. The interquartile range of EASE estimates for chloroprene fell above the interquartile range of the measured data distributions in one process area, partially overlapped the third quartile of the measured data in five process areas and fell within the interquartile range in two process areas. EASE is not a substitute for actual exposure monitoring. However, EASE can be used in conditions that cannot otherwise be sampled and in preliminary exposure assessment if it is recognized that the actual interquartile range could be much wider and/or offset by a factor of 10 or more.",

    "abstract": "This study quantifies the effects of iodine on the intellectual development of children using a systematic manual literature search of Chinese publications related to iodine deficiency disorders. The Chinese Medical Reference Database, Medline, and Cochrane library were searched electronically in Chinese and English. Inclusion criteria included: studies conducted in China, comparing children (<16 ys) living in naturally iodine sufficient (IS) with those in severely iodine deficient (ID) areas, or children in ID areas born before and after the introduction of iodine supplementation. Intelligent Quotient (IQ) was measured using Binet or Raven Scales. The iodine sufficient control groups were comparable socially, economically, and educationally with the study groups. Random effects models were used in the meta-analysis. Effect size was the standard deviation IQ point (SIQP), which is equivalent to 15 IQ. Thirty-seven reported studies, total 12,291 children, were analysed. The effect size was an increase of 0.83, 0.82, and 0.32 SIQP respectively, for the children living in IS communities compared with those living in ID areas with no iodine supplementation, with inadequate iodine supplementation, or children who had received iodine during their mothers' pregnancy and after birth. These equal to 12.45, 12.3, 4.8 IQ points. Compared with that of children whose mothers were persistently exposed to ID, the total effect size of the 21 entries was an increase of 0.58 SIQP (8.7 IQ points) in the group receiving iodine supplementation during pregnancy. Furthermore, there was an increase on 1.15 SIQP of Binet or 0.8 SIQP on Raven Scale (17.25 or 12 IQ points) for children born more than 3.5 years after iodine supplementation program was introduced. The level of iodine nutrition plays a crucial role in the intellectual development of children. The intelligence damage of children exposed to severe ID was profound, demonstrated by 12.45 IQ points loss and they recovered 8.7 IQ points with iodine supplementation or IS before and during pregnancy. Iodine supplementation before and during pregnancy to women living in severe ID areas could prevent their children from intelligence deficit. This effect becomes evident in children born 3.5 years after the iodine supplementation program was introduced.",

    "abstract": "We examined the relationship between structural brain variation and general intelligence using voxel-based morphometric analysis of MRI data in men and women with equivalent IQ scores. Compared to men, women show more white matter and fewer gray matter areas related to intelligence. In men IQ/gray matter correlations are strongest in frontal and parietal lobes (BA 8, 9, 39, 40), whereas the strongest correlations in women are in the frontal lobe (BA10) along with Broca's area. Men and women apparently achieve similar IQ results with different brain regions, suggesting that there is no singular underlying neuroanatomical structure to general intelligence and that different types of brain designs may manifest equivalent intellectual performance.",

    "abstract": "To study the association between Cholecystokinin A receptor (CCKAR) genotypes and intelligence in community-living men and women.\nSubjects were 2251 community-dwelling Japanese men and women aged 40 to 79 years. The CCKAR gene promoter polymorphisms A-81G and G-128T were determined. Intelligence was assessed by Japanese Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales - Revised Short Forms (JWAIS-R SF). The difference in intelligence between wild type and mutation was tested.\nThere were no subjects with AA/GT, AA/TT, or AG/TT genotypic combinations. Both A-81G and G-128T genotypes were related to intelligence quotient (IQ) estimated by JWAIS-R SF. The mean and SE of IQ levels of subjects with the wild-type allele and the mutation allele at nucleotide -128 were 103.4 +/- 0.3 and 101.6 +/- 0.6, respectively. There was a significant difference in IQ for G-128T (p=0.008). The difference in IQ for A-81G was also significant (p=0.011). The IQ level was 103.6 +/- 0.4 in the subjects with the wild-type allele and 102.0 +/- 0.5 in the subjects with the mutation. Differences in IQ levels by haplotypes for combinations of A-81G/G-128T were examined. IQ significantly decreased with an increasing number of mutation alleles (p=0.018).\nThere were statistically significant differences in IQ for CCKAR gene promoter polymorphisms A-81G and G-128T in community-living Japanese.",

    "abstract": "The present study evaluated cerebral lateralization during Raven's progressive matrices (RPM) paradigm in female and male subjects. Bilateral simultaneous transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound was used to measure mean blood flow velocities (MBFV) in the right and left middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) in 24 (15 females and 9 males) right-handed normal subjects. The female subjects used a left hemisphere strategy, while males used a right hemisphere strategy to successfully solve RPM tasks. This implies that general intelligence is associated with neural systems within one hemisphere that are accessible to a variety of cognitive processes.",

    "abstract": "The rationale for the present study was to investigate the relationship between cortical volume, the latency of the ERP component P3a (as a measure of speed-of-processing), and performance intelligence (not adjusted for age differences). Seventy-one participants aged 20-88 years underwent a visual 3-stimuli oddball ERP task, an MRI-scan, and intelligence testing. P3a latency and cortical volume shared 9% variance (p<.05) and both were significantly related to performance intelligence (R2=.26 and .40, respectively). The amount of explained variance increased significantly (to R2=.51) when both measures were used as simultaneous predictors. When a path diagram was constructed including age as an exogenous variable, P3a latency and cortical volume both significantly predicted performance intelligence, but were no longer related to one another. The main conclusion from the study is that speed and size are complementary in prediction of performance intelligence, and the theoretical implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "In patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), poor performance on cognitive tests has been found. Performance on memory tasks has been reported to correlate with disease activity, but memory in MG patients was also recently found to be unimpaired.\nCognitive functioning was examined in 23 patients with MG and 23 healthy controls. The patients were assessed for IQ, memory, attention, and motor performance. Immunoglobulin G antiacetylcholine receptor autoantibody titers were determined. Event-related potentials were generated for patients and controls.\nMean IQs of patients were at average. Memory and attention were not more impaired in patients than controls. Event-related potentials were not delayed in either group. Patients with elevated autoantibody concentrations similarly showed unimpaired neurocognitive and motor functioning.\nIn this study, no evidence of neuropsychological impairment was found in MG, arguing against the involvement of higher cortical functions. Sleep abnormalities rather than central mechanisms may explain the memory impairments reported by some studies.",

    "abstract": "The main objectives of this prospective study were to (1) assess memory and intelligence outcome following surgery for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy, (2) correlate this with seizure outcome and side of surgery, and (3) perform (1) and (2) using an indigenously developed battery customized to the Indian population. Prior to use in our epilepsy surgery program, the test-retest and interexaminer variance reliability of this battery had been established in both normal and cognitively compromised populations. The memory scores were overall rather than material-specific. The battery was administered to right-handed adults undergoing surgery for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy without any evidence of opposite temporal lobe abnormality, both presurgery and postsurgery at a mean follow-up of 8 months. Twenty-five consecutive patients were included; 13 underwent right and 12 underwent left temporal surgery. Seizure outcome was assessed using Engel's classification. Among 13 patients who underwent right temporal surgery, although 4 patients with poor seizure outcome had insignificant changes in scores, 7 of 9 patients with good seizure outcome exhibited considerable (> 20% over preoperative) improvement in their memory and intelligence scores. Statistical analysis using Student's t test and the Mann-Whitney test revealed that the patients who underwent right temporal surgery with good seizure outcome had significant improvement in both memory (P = 0.007) and intelligence (P = 0.043) scores compared with those with poor seizure outcome. In contrast, patients who underwent left temporal surgery had no significant change in cognitive scores irrespective of seizure outcome. Cognitive improvement seems to occur in patients with good seizure outcome following nondominant temporal lobe surgery for intractable epilepsy with no evidence of pathology in the opposite temporal lobe. The same finding was not observed in patients undergoing left temporal surgery.",

    "abstract": "Standard models in economics stress the role of intelligent agents who maximize utility. However, there may be situations where constraints imposed by market institutions dominate strategic agent behavior. We use data from the London Stock Exchange to test a simple model in which minimally intelligent agents place orders to trade at random. The model treats the statistical mechanics of order placement, price formation, and the accumulation of revealed supply and demand within the context of the continuous double auction and yields simple laws relating order-arrival rates to statistical properties of the market. We test the validity of these laws in explaining cross-sectional variation for 11 stocks. The model explains 96% of the variance of the gap between the best buying and selling prices (the spread) and 76% of the variance of the price diffusion rate, with only one free parameter. We also study the market impact function, describing the response of quoted prices to the arrival of new orders. The nondimensional coordinates dictated by the model approximately collapse data from different stocks onto a single curve. This work is important from a practical point of view, because it demonstrates the existence of simple laws relating prices to order flows and, in a broader context, suggests there are circumstances where the strategic behavior of agents may be dominated by other considerations.",

    "abstract": "For both humans and animals, domain-general mechanisms are fallible but powerful tools for attaining evolutionary goals (e.g., resources) in uncertain, novel environments that were not recurrent features of the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Domain-general mechanisms interact in complex ways with domain-specific, information-encapsulated modules, most importantly by manipulating information obtained from various modules in attempting to solve novel problems. Mechanisms of general intelligence, particularly the executive functions of working memory, underlie analogical reasoning as well as the decontextualization processes that are central to human thought. Although there is a variety of evolved, special purpose learning devices, learning is also characterized by domain-general mechanisms that are able to achieve evolutionary goals by making novel and serendipitous associations with environmental cues.",

    "abstract": "An association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and cognitive and behavioural development has been observed in several studies, but potential effects of maternal smoking on offspring adult intelligence have not been investigated. The objective of the present study was to investigate a potential association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring intelligence in young adulthood. Adult intelligence was assessed at the mean age of 18.7 years by a military draft board intelligence test (Borge Priens Prove) for 3044 singleton males from the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort with information regarding maternal smoking during the third trimester coded into five categories (about 50% of the mothers were smokers). The following potential confounders were included as covariates in multivariable analyses: parental social status and education, single mother status, mother's height and age, number of pregnancies, and gestational age. In separate analyses, birthweight and length were also included as covariates. Maternal cigarette smoking during the third trimester, adjusted for the seven covariates, showed a negative association with offspring adult intelligence (P=0.0001). The mean difference between the no-smoking and the heaviest smoking category amounted to 0.41 standard deviation, corresponding to an IQ difference of 6.2 points [95% confidence interval 0.14, 0.68]. The association remained significant when further adjusted for birthweight and length (P=0.007). Both unadjusted and adjusted means suggested a dose-response relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring adult intelligence. When subjects with missing data were excluded, essentially the same results were obtained in the reduced sample (n=1829). These results suggest that smoking during pregnancy may have long-term negative consequences on offspring adult intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in the definitional literature on mental retardation emphasize the need to ground the concept of adaptive behavior in an expanded model of intelligence, which includes practical and social intelligence. Development of a direct measure of practical intelligence might increase the likelihood that an assessment of this domain would be included in the diagnostic process of mental retardation. The current paper reports on the preliminary exploration of the validity and utility of using a videotaped portrayal of everyday tasks, with built-in errors, as a measure of practical intelligence. A correlation of .79 was found between the practical intelligence video score and the Vineland domestic and community sub-domains score in 50 adults with mild and moderate mental retardation. This suggests that the instruments are essentially measuring the same domain of human competence. The unexplained variance may be attributed to the fact that the video measure is more directly measuring cognition.",

A variety of sophisticated brain-mapping approaches relating genetic influences on brain structure and intelligence establishes a regional distribution for this relationship that is consistent with behavioral studies. We highlight those studies that illustrate the complex cortical patterns associated with measures of cognitive ability. A measure of cognitive ability, known as g, has been shown highly heritable across many studies. We argue that these genetic links are partly mediated by brain structure that is likewise under strong genetic control. Other factors, such as the environment, obviously play a role, but the predominant determinant appears to be genetic.",

    "abstract": "In this article, the authors argue that the overwhelming portion of the literature on intelligence, race, and genetics is based on folk taxonomies rather than scientific analysis. They suggest that because theorists of intelligence disagree as to what it is, any consideration of its relationships to other constructs must be tentative at best. They further argue that race is a social construction with no scientific definition. Thus, studies of the relationship between race and other constructs may serve social ends but cannot serve scientific ends. No gene has yet been conclusively linked to intelligence, so attempts to provide a compelling genetic link of race to intelligence are not feasible at this time. The authors also show that heritability, a behavior-genetic concept, is inadequate in regard to providing such a link.",

Boyle (2005; see record 2004-22408-002) that working memory capacity (WMC) is not isomorphic with general fluid intelligence (Gf) or reasoning ability. However, the WMC and Gf/reasoning constructs are more strongly associated than Ackerman et al. (2005) indicate, particularly when considering the outcomes of latent-variable studies. The authors' reanalysis of 14 such data sets from 10 published studies, representing more than 3,100 young-adult subjects, suggests a strong correlation between WMC and Gf/reasoning factors (median r=.72), indicating that the WMC and Gf constructs share approximately 50% of their variance. This comment also clarifies the authors' \"executive attention\" view of WMC, it demonstrates that WMC has greater discriminant validity than Ackerman et al. (2005) implied, and it suggests some future directions and challenges for the scientific study of the convergence of WMC, attention control, and intelligence.",

    "abstract": "On the basis of a meta-analysis of pairwise correlations between working memory tasks and cognitive ability measures, P. L. Ackerman, M. E. Beier, and M. O. Boyle (2005; see record 2004-22408-002) claimed that working memory capacity (WMC) shares less than 25% of its variance with general intelligence (g) and with reasoning ability. In this comment, the authors argue that this is an underestimation because of several methodological shortcomings and biases. A reanalysis of the data reported in Ackerman et al. using the correct statistical procedures demonstrates that g and WMC are very highly correlated. On a conceptual level, the authors point out that WMC should be regarded as an explanatory construct for intellectual abilities. Theories of working memory do not claim that WMC is isomorphic with intelligence factors but that it is a very strong predictor of reasoning ability and also predicts general fluid intelligence and g.",

    "abstract": "Several investigators have claimed over the past decade that working memory (WM) and general intelligence (g) are identical, or nearly identical, constructs, from an individual-differences perspective. Although memory measures are commonly included in intelligence tests, and memory abilities are included in theories of intelligence, the identity between WM and intelligence has not been evaluated comprehensively. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of 86 samples that relate WM to intelligence. The average correlation between true-score estimates of WM and g is substantially less than unity (p=.479). The authors also focus on the distinction between short-term memory and WM with respect to intelligence with a supplemental meta-analysis. The authors discuss how consideration of psychometric and theoretical perspectives better informs the discussion of WM-intelligence relations.",

    "abstract": "Long-term intellectual performance in breech-presented infants may be negatively affected by vaginal delivery. We evaluated the effect of presentation at birth and delivery mode on intellectual performance at age 18 years in a nationwide population study.\nWe studied 8,738 male infants in breech and 384,832 males in cephalic presentation registered in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, 1967-1979, and linked to data registered at the National Conscript Service, 1984-1999. Test scores of intelligence testing at conscription were presented as standard nine (\"stanine\") scores. Mean stanine scores and odds ratios of low score were computed and adjusted for birth order, maternal age, and education.\nMean stanine score was slightly higher among breech-presented males than among cephalic-presented males (5.26 versus 5.22, P = .05), whereas after adjustment the difference disappeared (P = .3). Breech-presented infants had lower mean scores if delivered by cesarean compared with vaginal breech delivery (P = .03), and cephalic-presented males scored lower if their mothers had a cesarean delivery instead of a vaginal delivery (P < .001). Comparing cesarean and vaginal delivery in breech births, the odds ratio of having a stanine score less than or equal to 3 was 1.12 (95% confidence interval 0.92,1.36), after adjustment for confounding factors.\nPresentation at birth did not affect adult intellectual performance. Cesarean delivery of breech-presented infants did not improve adult intellectual performance when compared with a vaginal delivery. The excess perinatal hazards of breech-presented infants with a vaginal delivery were not reflected in adult intellectual performance.",

    "abstract": "For several decades it has been known that mental retardation is associated with abnormalities in dendrites and dendritic spines. The recent cloning of eight genes which cause nonspecific mental retardation when mutated, provides an important insight into the cellular mechanisms that result in the dendritic abnormalities underlying mental retardation. Three of the encoded proteins, oligophrenin1, PAK3 and alphaPix, interact directly with Rho GTPases. Rho GTPases are key signaling proteins which integrate extracellular and intracellular signals to orchestrate coordinated changes in the actin cytoskeleton, essential for directed neurite outgrowth and the generation/rearrangement of synaptic connectivity. Although many details of the cell biology of Rho signaling in the CNS are as yet unclear, a picture is unfolding showing how mutations that cause abnormal Rho signaling result in abnormal neuronal connectivity which gives rise to deficient cognitive functioning in humans.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing literature describing a subgroup of \"high-functioning\" people with schizophrenia who show preserved intellectual ability (IQ). A detailed characterisation of the cognitive abilities of this group may be important in targeting appropriate treatment, management and services for patients with schizophrenia. It is a widely held belief that variation in cognitive processing speed is the basis of individual differences in intelligence. The main objective of this study was to identify subgroups of schizophrenia patients with preserved (N=45), deteriorated (N=47) and compromised (N=17) intellect in order to study whether these subgroups differ in specific cognitive abilities (e.g. executive functions) or in general cognitive processing speed, as measured with an inspection time (IT) task. The patients who displayed an average estimated premorbid IQ, with no evidence of IQ decline (premorbid-current IQ difference <10 points), were found to show better performance on measures of executive function (continuous performance task, verbal fluency) compared with patients in the deteriorated and compromised subgroups. Nevertheless, this represented significantly impaired performance relative to healthy controls. In contrast, the average inspection times of patients with preserved IQ were as slow as those obtained in the deteriorated or compromised groups, indicating that high functioning patients are impaired in terms of cognitive processing speed. Furthermore, the average IT for all schizophrenia groups was significantly slower than that of healthy controls. These findings suggest that high functioning patients with schizophrenia exhibit enduring cognitive difficulties that may impact on their ability to benefit from rehabilitation interventions.",
