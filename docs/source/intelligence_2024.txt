    "abstract": "Lung ultrasound (LUS) aids in the diagnosis of patients with dyspnea, including those with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, but requires technical proficiency for image acquisition. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in guiding novice users to acquire high-quality cardiac ultrasound images, suggesting its potential for broader use in LUS.\nTo evaluate the ability of AI to guide acquisition of diagnostic-quality LUS images by trained health care professionals (THCPs).\nIn this multicenter diagnostic validation study conducted between July 2023 and December 2023, participants aged 21 years or older with shortness of breath recruited from 4 clinical sites underwent 2 ultrasound examinations: 1 examination by a THCP operator using Lung Guidance AI and the other by a trained LUS expert without AI. The THCPs (including medical assistants, respiratory therapists, and nurses) underwent standardized AI training for LUS acquisition before participation.\nLung Guidance AI software uses deep learning algorithms guiding LUS image acquisition and B-line annotation. Using an 8-zone LUS protocol, the AI software automatically captures images of diagnostic quality.\nThe primary end point was the proportion of THCP-acquired examinations of diagnostic quality according to a panel of 5 masked expert LUS readers, who provided remote review and ground truth validation.\nThe intention-to-treat analysis included 176 participants (81 female participants [46.0%]; mean [SD] age, 63 [14] years; mean [SD] body mass index, 31 [8]). Overall, 98.3% (95% CI, 95.1%-99.4%) of THCP-acquired studies were of diagnostic quality, with no statistically significant difference in quality compared to LUS expert-acquired studies (difference, 1.7%; 95% CI, -1.6% to 5.0%).\nIn this multicenter validation study, THCPs with AI assistance achieved LUS images meeting diagnostic standards compared with LUS experts without AI. This technology could extend access to LUS to underserved areas lacking expert personnel.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05992324.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to validate a clinically available artificial intelligence (AI) model to assist general radiologists in the detection of intracranial aneurysm (IA) in a multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) study, and to explore its performance in routine clinical settings.\nTwo distinct cohorts of head CT angiography (CTA) data were assembled to validate an AI model. Cohort 1, comprising gold-standard consecutive CTA cases, was used in an MRMC study involving six board-certified general radiologists. Cohort 2, representing clinical CTA cases, was used to simulate a routine clinical setting. Following these evaluations, an algorithmic audit was conducted to identify any unusual or unexpected behaviors exhibited by the model.\nCohort 1 consisted of 131 CTA cases, while Cohort 2 included 515 CTA cases. In the MRMC study, the AI-assisted strategy demonstrated a significant improvement in aneurysm diagnostic performance, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increasing from 0.815 (95%CI: 0.754-0.875) to 0.875 (95%CI: 0.831-0.921; p\u2009=\u20090.008). In the AI-based first-reader study, 60.4% of the CTA cases were identified as negative by the AI, with a high negative predictive value of 0.994 (95%CI: 0.977-0.999). The algorithmic audit highlighted two issues for improvement: the accurate detection of tiny aneurysms and the effective exclusion of false-positive lesions.\nThis study highlights the clinical utility of a high-performance AI model in detecting IAs, significantly improving general radiologists' diagnostic performance with the potential to reduce their workload in routine clinical practice. The algorithmic audit offers insights to guide the development and validation of future AI models.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) reading digital mammograms in increasing the chance of detecting missed breast cancer, by studying the AI- flagged early morphology indictors, overlooked by the radiologist, and correlating them with the missed cancer pathology types.\nMammograms done in 2020-2023, presenting breast carcinomas (n\u202f=\u202f1998), were analyzed in concordance with the prior one year's result (2019-2022) assumed negative or benign. Present mammograms reviewed for the descriptors: asymmetry, distortion, mass, and microcalcifications. The AI presented abnormalities by overlaying color hue and scoring percentage for the degree of suspicion of malignancy.\nPrior mammogram with AI marking compromised 54\u202f% (n\u202f=\u202f555), and in the present mammograms, AI targeted 904 (88\u202f%) carcinomas. The descriptor proportion of \"asymmetry\" was the common presentation of missed breast carcinoma (64.1\u202f%) in the prior mammograms and the highest detection rate for AI was presented by \"distortion\" (100\u202f%) followed by \"grouped microcalcifications\" (80\u202f%). AI performance to predict malignancy in previously assigned negative or benign mammograms showed sensitivity of 73.4\u202f%, specificity of 89\u202f%, and accuracy of 78.4\u202f%.\nReading mammograms with AI significantly enhances the detection of early cancerous changes, particularly in dense breast tissues. The AI's detection rate does not correlate with specific pathological types of breast cancer, highlighting its broad utility. Subtle mammographic changes in postmenopausal women, not corroborated by ultrasound but marked by AI, warrant further evaluation by advanced applications of digital mammograms and close interval AI-reading mammogram follow up to minimize the potential for missed breast carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Surgeon fatigue significantly affects cognitive and motor functions, increasing the risk of errors and adverse patient outcomes. Traditional fatigue management methods, such as structured breaks and duty-hour limits, are insufficient for real-time fatigue detection in high-stakes surgeries. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), there is growing potential for AI-driven technologies to address this issue through continuous monitoring and adaptive interventions. This paper explores how AI, via machine learning algorithms, wearable devices, and real-time feedback systems, enables comprehensive fatigue detection by analysing physiological, behavioural, and environmental data. Techniques such as heart rate variability analysis, electroencephalogram monitoring, and computer vision-based behavioural analysis are examined, as well as predictive models that provide proactive solutions. These AI-driven systems could suggest personalized break schedules, task redistribution, and interface adaptations in response to real-time fatigue indicators, potentially enhancing surgical safety and precision. However, ethical challenges, including data privacy and surgeon autonomy, must be carefully navigated to foster acceptance and integration within clinical settings. This review highlights AI's transformative potential in optimizing fatigue management and improving overall outcomes in the operating room\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.",

    "abstract": "The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to permeate most industries, including medicine, and patients will inevitably start using these large language model (LLM) chatbots as a modality for education. As healthcare information technology evolves, it is imperative to evaluate chatbots and the accuracy of the information they provide to patients and to determine if there is variability between them.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and comprehensiveness of three chatbots in addressing questions related to endometriosis and determine the level of variability between them.\nThree LLMs, including Chat GPT-4 (Open AI), Claude (Anthropic), and Bard (Google) were asked to generate answers to 10 commonly asked questions about endometriosis. The responses were qualitatively compared to current guidelines and expert opinion on endometriosis and rated on a scale by nine gynecologists. The grading scale included the following: (1) Completely incorrect, (2) mostly incorrect and some correct, (3) mostly correct and some incorrect, (4) correct but inadequate, (5) correct and comprehensive. Final scores were averaged between the nine reviewers. Kendall's \nAverage scores for the 10 answers amongst Bard, Chat GPT, and Claude were 3.69, 4.24, and 3.7, respectively. Two questions showed significant disagreement between the nine reviewers. There were no questions the models could answer comprehensively or correctly across the reviewers. The model most associated with comprehensive and correct responses was ChatGPT. Chatbots showed an improved ability to accurately answer questions about symptoms and pathophysiology over treatment and risk of recurrence.\nThe analysis of LLMs revealed that, on average, they mainly provided correct but inadequate responses to commonly asked patient questions about endometriosis. While chatbot responses can serve as valuable supplements to information provided by licensed medical professionals, it is crucial to maintain a thorough ongoing evaluation process for outputs to provide the most comprehensive and accurate information to patients. Further research into this technology and its role in patient education and treatment is crucial as generative AI becomes more embedded in the medical field.",

    "abstract": "Journals and publishers are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to screen submissions for potential misconduct, including plagiarism and data or image manipulation. While using AI can enhance the integrity of published manuscripts, it can also increase the risk of false/unsubstantiated allegations. Ambiguities related to journals' and publishers' responsibilities concerning fairness and transparency also raise ethical concerns. In this Topic Piece, we offer the following guidance: (1) All cases of suspected misconduct identified by AI tools should be carefully reviewed by humans to verify accuracy and ensure accountability; (2) Journals/publishers that use AI tools to detect misconduct should use only well-tested and reliable tools, remain vigilant concerning forms of misconduct that cannot be detected by these tools, and stay abreast of advancements in technology; (3) Journals/publishers should inform authors about irregularities identified by AI tools and give them a chance to respond before forwarding allegations to their institutions in accordance with Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines; (4) Journals/publishers that use AI tools to detect misconduct should screen all relevant submissions and not just random/purposefully selected submissions; and (5) Journals should inform authors about their definition of misconduct, their use of AI tools to detect misconduct, and their policies and procedures for responding to suspected cases of misconduct.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to create a risk prediction model with artificial intelligence (AI) to identify patients at higher risk of postpartum hemorrhage using perinatal characteristics that may be associated with later postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in twin pregnancies that underwent cesarean section. The study was planned as a retrospective cohort study at University Hospital. All twin cesarean deliveries were categorized into two groups: those with and without PPH. Using the perinatal characteristics of the cases, four different machine learning classifiers were created: Logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). LR, RF, and SVM models were created a second time by including class weights to manage the underlying imbalances in the data. A total of 615 twin pregnancies were included in the study. There were 150 twin pregnancies with PPH and 465 without PPH. Dichorionity, PAS, and placenta previa were significantly higher in the PPH-positive group (",

    "abstract": "In healthcare settings, particularly in intensive care units, nurses face significant stress due to the high demands of their job. This stress can impact their job satisfaction, mental health, and overall quality of life. Emotional intelligence has been identified as a crucial factor that can mitigate workplace stress and enhance job satisfaction. Moreover, work-life balance is increasingly recognized as a critical factor influencing job satisfaction in the nursing profession.\nOur study aims at understanding the mediating effect of work-life balance between emotional intelligence and job satisfaction in Lebanese nurses working in the Intensive Care Unit.\nThis study has a cross-sectional design.\nNurses working in intensive care units of one hospital (n\u2009=\u2009100) were asked to fill an online questionnaire which included the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, Work-Life Balance Self-Assessment Scale, and Job Satisfaction Scale.\nWork Interference with Personal Life and Personal Life Interference with Work acted as significant mediators between emotional intelligence and job satisfaction. Specifically, the direct role of emotional intelligence on job satisfaction was found to be significant, with work interference with personal life (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.02, SE\u2009=\u2009.01, p\u2009=\u2009.001) and personal life interference with work (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.02, SE\u2009=\u2009.01, p\u2009=\u2009.002) showing significant indirect roles. Higher emotional intelligence was directly and significantly associated with more job satisfaction (p\u2009<\u2009.01).\nThe study underscores the potential benefits of emotional intelligence training and work-life balance promotion in enhancing nurses' job satisfaction.\nPending future longitudinal studies, findings cautiously imply that targeting work-life balance could help foster the positive connection between emotional intelligence and Job Satisfaction among nurses. Accordingly, healthcare administrators should prioritize policies that promote flexible scheduling, sufficient staffing levels, and mental health resources, which are essential for maintaining a balance between professional obligations Job Satisfaction and personal life.",

    "abstract": "GI (Gastrointestinal) malignancies are one of the most common and lethal cancers globally. The dawn of precision medicine and developing technologies have reduced the mortality rates for GI malignancies, underscoring the main role of early detection methods for survival rate improvement. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a new technology that may improve GI cancer screening, treatment, and therapeutic efficiency for better patient care. AI could accelerate the development of targeted therapies by analyzing considerable data from the genome and identifying biomarkers connected with GI tumors. This opens up new avenues toward more tailored and personalized approaches, raising efficacy while reducing undesired side effects. For instance, AI may improve treatment outcomes by accurately predicting patient responses to therapeutic regimens, helping oncologists choose the most effective treatment options. This review will outline the transformative potential of AI in GI oncology by emphasizing the incorporation of AI-based technologies to enhance patient care.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to evaluate the specific performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for lung nodule detection in chest radiography for a larger number of nodules of different sizes and densities using a standardized phantom approach. A total of 450 nodules with varying density (d1 to d3) and size (3, 5, 8, 10 and 12\u2009mm) were inserted in a Lungman phantom at various locations. Radiographic images with varying projections were acquired and processed using the AI algorithm for nodule detection. Computed tomography (CT) was performed for correlation. Ground truth (detectability) was established through a human consensus reading. Overall sensitivity and specificity of 0.978 and 0.812, respectively, were achieved for nodule detection. The false-positive rate was low with an overall rate of 0.19. The overall accuracy was calculated as 0.84 for all nodules. While most studies evaluating AI performance in the detection of pulmonary nodules have evaluated a mix of varying nodules, these are the first results of a controlled phantom-based study using a balanced number of nodules of all sizes and densities. To increase the radiologist's diagnostic performance and minimize the risk of decision bias, such algorithms have an obvious benefit in a clinical scenario.",

    "abstract": "In malaria infection, quantifying blood parasitemia is a critical step for evaluating the severity of the disease. This has generally been conducted manually, and thus, its accuracy depends on the expertise of technicians. There is an urgent need for an automated technique to overcome manual errors. The aim of the study is to find an alternative method for counting malaria blood parasitemia.\nThis study evaluated the accuracy of automated counting using QuPath compared to manual counting. GraphPad Kappa evaluated agreement between high and low parasitemia in both counting methods using Cohen's test.\nQuPath was revealed to be a promising method that has fair agreement and no statistically significant differences compared to manual counting.\nIn conclusion, automated quantification is suggested to be a time- and effort-saving technique and, therefore, a worthwhile alternative to manual counting.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence broadly refers to computer systems that simulate intelligent behaviour with minimal human intervention. Emphasizing patient-centered care, research has explored patients' perspectives on artificial intelligence in medical care, indicating general acceptance of the technology but also concerns about supervision. However, these views have not been systematically examined from the perspective of patients with cancer, whose opinions may differ given the distinct psychosocial toll of the disease.\nThis protocol describes a scoping review aimed at summarizing the existing literature on the attitudes of patients with cancer toward the use of artificial intelligence in their medical care. The primary goal is to identify knowledge gaps and highlight opportunities for future research.\nThis scoping review protocol will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA-ScR). The electronic databases MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL will be searched for peer-reviewed primary research articles published in academic journals. We will have two independent reviewers screen the articles retrieved from the literature search and select relevant studies based on our inclusion criteria, with a third reviewer resolving any disagreements. We will then compile the data from the included articles into a narrative summary and discuss the implications for clinical practice and future research.\nTo our knowledge, this will be the first scoping review to map the existing literature on the attitudes of patients with cancer regarding artificial intelligence in their medical care.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the application of Artificial Intelligence and network science methodologies in characterizing interdisciplinary disciplines, with a specific focus on the field of Italian design, taken as a paradigmatic example. Exploratory data analysis and the study of academic collaboration networks highlight how the field is evolving towards increased collaboration. Text analysis and semantic topic modelling identified the evolution of research interest over time, defining a ranking of pairs of keywords and three prominent research topics: User-Centric Experience Design, Innovative Product Design and Sustainable Service Design. Our results revealed a significant transformation in the field, with a shift from individual to collaborative research, as evidenced by the increasing complexity and collaboration within groups. We acknowledge the limitations faced by this work, suggesting that the methodology may be primarily suitable for bibliometric and more silos-like disciplines. However, we emphasize the urgency for the scientific community to address the future of research not indexed by large open-access databases like OpenAlex.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the ability of human readers, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), and an online artificial intelligence (AI) detection tool (GPTZero) to distinguish between AI-generated and human-written personal statements in physical therapist education program applications.\nThe emergence of large language models such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini has raised concerns about the authenticity of personal statements. Previous studies have reported varying degrees of success in detecting AI-generated text.\nData were collected from 50 randomly selected nonmatriculated individuals who applied to the Mayo Clinic School of Health Sciences Doctor of Physical Therapy Program during the 2021-2022 application cycle.\nFifty personal statements from applicants were pooled with 50 Google Gemini-generated statements, then analyzed by 2 individuals, RQA, and GPTZero. RQA provided quantitative measures of lexical sophistication, whereas GPTZero used advanced machine learning algorithms to quantify AI-specific text characteristics.\nHuman raters demonstrated high agreement (\u03ba = 0.92) and accuracy (97% and 99%). RQA parameters, particularly recurrence and max line, differentiated human- from AI-generated statements (areas under receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve = 0.768 and 0.859, respectively). GPTZero parameters including simplicity, perplexity, and readability also differentiated human- from AI-generated statements (areas under ROC curve > 0.875).\nThe study reveals that human raters, RQA, and GPTZero offer varying levels of accuracy in differentiating human-written from AI-generated personal statements. The findings could have important implications in academic admissions processes, where distinguishing between human- and AI-generated submissions is becoming increasingly important. Future research should explore integrating these methods to enhance the robustness and reliability of personal statement content evaluation across various domains. Three strategies for managing AI's role in applications-for applicants, governing organizations, and academic institutions-are provided to promote integrity and accountability in admission processes.",

    "abstract": "Optic neuritis (ON) is a complex clinical syndrome that has diverse etiologies and treatments based on its subtypes. Notably, ON associated with multiple sclerosis (MS ON) has a good prognosis for recovery irrespective of treatment, whereas ON associated with other conditions including neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease is often associated with less favorable outcomes. Delay in treatment of these non-MS ON subtypes can lead to irreversible vision loss. It is important to distinguish MS ON from other ON subtypes early, to guide appropriate management. Yet, identifying ON and differentiating subtypes can be challenging as MRI and serological antibody test results are not always readily available in the acute setting. The purpose of this study is to develop a deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to predict subtype based on fundus photographs, to aid the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected ON.\nThis was a retrospective study of patients with ON seen at our institution between 2007 and 2022. Fundus photographs (1,599) were retrospectively collected from a total of 321 patients classified into 2 groups: MS ON (262 patients; 1,114 photographs) and non-MS ON (59 patients; 485 photographs). The dataset was divided into training and holdout test sets with an 80%/20% ratio, using stratified sampling to ensure equal representation of MS ON and non-MS ON patients in both sets. Model hyperparameters were tuned using 5-fold cross-validation on the training dataset. The overall performance and generalizability of the model was subsequently evaluated on the holdout test set.\nThe receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the developed model, evaluated on the holdout test dataset, yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.92). The model attained an accuracy of 76.2% (95% CI, 68.4-83.1), a sensitivity of 74.2% (95% CI, 55.9-87.4) and a specificity of 76.9% (95% CI, 67.6-85.0) in classifying images as non-MS-related ON.\nThis study provides preliminary evidence supporting a role for AI in differentiating non-MS ON subtypes from MS ON. Future work will aim to increase the size of the dataset and explore the role of combining clinical and paraclinical measures to refine deep learning models over time.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to explore the validity and inter-device reliability of a novel artificial intelligence app (Asstrapp) for real-time measurement of the traditional (tra505) and modified-505 (mod505) change of direction (COD) tests. Twenty-five male Sports Science students (age, 23.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.27\u00a0years; body height, 178\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.76\u00a0cm; body mass, 79.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.7\u00a0kg) completed 12 trials each, consisting of six tra505 and six mod505 trials. Completion times were simultaneously recorded via single-beam electronic timing gates (ETG) and two different iPhones (APP1 and APP2). In total 300 trials were collected across the two tests, using all three devices, to establish the reliability and validity of the app. The coefficient of variation indicated a similar level of dispersion between the ETG (\u2264\u00a02.73%), APP1 (\u2264\u00a02.39%) and APP2 (\u2264\u00a02.52%). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) revealed excellent reliability among the three timing devices (ICC \u2265\u00a00.99) and Asstrapp relative reliability was excellent for both APP1 (ICC \u2265\u00a00.91) and APP2 (ICC \u2265\u00a00.91). There was a practically perfect correlation and agreement between ETG and Asstrapp (APP1: r\u00a0=\u00a00.97; APP2: r\u00a0=\u00a00.97) for both COD tests. However, small but significant differences were found between smartphones and ETG for tra505 (ES\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.33; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Collectively, these findings support the use of Asstrapp for real-time assessment of both 505 COD tests.",

    "abstract": "This original study aimed to examine the relationship of emotional intelligence and passion to decision-making\u00a0in surgical nurses.\nIt is a descriptive, relational study.\nThis study was conducted with 166 surgical nurses. Data for the study were collected using the Descriptive Characteristics Form, Passion Scale, Emotional Intelligence Scale, and Nurse Decision-Making Scale.\nThe decision-making level of 85.6% of the surgical nurses was found to be at the third level. There was a 0.265\u00a0U\u00a0increase in decision-making score for a 1\u00a0U increase in nursing experience. A 1\u00a0U increase in the standard deviation of the Emotional Intelligence Scale increased the standard deviation of the Nursing Decision-Making Scale by 0.322\u00a0U,\u00a0and a 1\u00a0U increase in the standard deviation of the Passion Scale increased the standard deviation of the Nursing Decision-Making Scale by 0.268\u00a0U.\nSurgical nurses' passion, emotional intelligence, and decision-making levels were found to be high. A positive relationship was also found between the passion and emotional intelligence levels of surgical nurses and their decision-making. Decision-making is crucial in nursing, particularly in the surgical setting where passion and emotional intelligence play a significant role. This study highlights how passion, associated with professional growth\u00a0and emotional intelligence and\u00a0empathy and situational awareness, influence surgical nurses' decision-making processes.",

    "abstract": "Extrapancreatic perineural invasion (EPNI) increases the risk of postoperative recurrence in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This study aimed to develop and validate a computed tomography (CT)-based, fully automated preoperative artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict EPNI in patients with PDAC.\nThe authors retrospectively enrolled 1065 patients from two Shanghai hospitals between June 2014 and April 2023. Patients were split into training (n=497), internal validation (n=212), internal test (n=180), and external test (n=176) sets. The AI model used perivascular space and tumor contact for EPNI detection. The authors evaluated the AI model's performance based on its discrimination. Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests, and Cox regression were used for survival analysis.\nThe AI model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance for EPNI with 1-pixel expansion. The area under the curve in the training, validation, internal test, and external test sets were 0.87, 0.88, 0.82, and 0.83, respectively. The log-rank test revealed a significantly longer survival in the AI-predicted EPNI-negative group than the AI-predicted EPNI-positive group in the training, validation, and internal test sets (P<0.05). Moreover, the AI model exhibited exceptional prognostic stratification in early PDAC and improved assessment of neoadjuvant therapy's effectiveness.\nThe AI model presents a robust modality for EPNI diagnosis, risk stratification, and neoadjuvant treatment guidance in PDAC, and can be applied to guide personalized precision therapy.",

    "abstract": "Integrating robots and artificial intelligence (AI) into workplaces is becoming increasingly prevalent across various sectors, including hospitality. This trend has raised concerns regarding employee anxiety and the potential for higher turnover intentions, particularly when AI technologies are perceived to undermine professional expertise. This study explores the relationship between awareness of robotics and AI and employee turnover intentions, framed within the Conservation of Resources Theory (COR). To address the challenges posed by AI in the workforce, hotel managers must prioritise organizational support in areas such as financial resources, policy development, career advancement, and employee adaptation. The hospitality industry is leveraging AI and robotics to enhance guest interactions and service delivery, yet this technological shift may inadvertently increase employees' intentions to leave their positions. Employing a cross-sectional design, we gathered data through a structured questionnaire utilizing a five-point Likert scale, targeting 435 employees from 5- and 7-star hotels in Lahore, Pakistan, including CEOs, managers, directors, supervisors, executives, and room service operators. Our findings reveal a significant positive relationship between awareness of robotics and AI and employee turnover intentions. Moreover, mutual trust (MT) emerged as a moderating factor positively affecting the association between robotics awareness and turnover intentions. While technical grooming (TG) and job insecurity (JI) were not previously discussed in the literature, our research indicates that they also play critical roles in this context, highlighting the complex interplay of factors influencing turnover intentions in the face of advancing technology.",

    "abstract": "Accurate classification of lymphadenopathy is essential for determining the pathological nature of lymph nodes (LNs), which plays a crucial role in treatment selection. The biopsy method is invasive and carries the risk of sampling failure, while the utilization of non-invasive approaches such as ultrasound can minimize the probability of iatrogenic injury and infection. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, the diagnostic efficiency of LNs is further enhanced. This study evaluates the performance of ultrasound-based AI applications in the classification of benign and malignant LNs.\nThe literature research was conducted using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases as of June 2024. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated to assess the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasound-based AI in classifying benign and malignant LNs. Subgroup analyses were also conducted to identify potential sources of heterogeneity.\nA total of 1,355 studies were identified and reviewed. Among these studies, 19 studies met the inclusion criteria, and 2,354 cases were included in the analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and DOR of ultrasound-based machine learning in classifying benign and malignant LNs were 0.836 (95% CI [0.805, 0.863]), 0.850 (95% CI [0.805, 0.886]), and 33.331 (95% CI [22.873, 48.57]), respectively, indicating no publication bias (p\u2009=\u20090.12). Subgroup analyses may suggest that the location of lymph nodes, validation methods, and type of primary tumor are the sources of heterogeneity.\nAI can accurately differentiate benign from malignant LNs. Given the widespread use of ultrasonography in diagnosing malignant LNs in cancer patients, there is significant potential for integrating AI-based decision support systems into clinical practice to enhance the diagnostic accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been growing more powerful and accessible, and will increasingly impact many areas, including virtually all aspects of medicine and biomedical research. This review focuses on previous, current, and especially emerging applications of AI in clinical genetics. Topics covered include a brief explanation of different general categories of AI, including machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI. After introductory explanations and examples, the review discusses AI in clinical genetics in three main categories: clinical diagnostics; management and therapeutics; clinical support. The review concludes with short, medium, and long-term predictions about the ways that AI may affect the field of clinical genetics. Overall, while the precise speed at which AI will continue to change clinical genetics is unclear, as are the overall ramifications for patients, families, clinicians, researchers, and others, it is likely that AI will result in dramatic evolution in clinical genetics. It will be important for all those involved in clinical genetics to prepare accordingly in order to minimize the risks and maximize benefits related to the use of AI in the field.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model for the screening of degenerative joint disease (DJD) using temporomandibular joint (TMJ) panoramic radiography and joint noise data. A total of 2631 TMJ panoramic images were collected, resulting in a final dataset of 3908 images (2127 normal (N) and 1781 DJD (D)) after excluding indeterminate cases and errors. AI models using GoogleNet were evaluated with six different combinations of image data, clinician-detected crepitus, and patient-reported joint noise. The model that integrated all joint noise data with imaging demonstrated the highest performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.72. Another model, which incorporated both imaging and crepitus, also achieved the same F1-score but had lower D recall (0.55 vs. 0.67) and N precision (0.71 vs. 0.74). The AI models outperformed orofacial pain specialists when provided with imaging alone or in combination with all joint noise data. These findings suggest that AI-enhanced DJD diagnosis using TMJ panoramic radiography and joint noise data offers a promising approach for early detection and improved patient care. The results underscore AI's capability to integrate diverse diagnostic factors, providing a comprehensive and accurate assessment that surpasses traditional methods.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) tools can triage radiology scans to streamline the patient pathway and also relieve clinician workload. Validated AI tools can mitigate the delays in reporting scans by flagging time-sensitive and actionable findings. In this study, we aim to investigate current stakeholder perspectives and identify obstacles to integrating AI in clinical pathways. We created a survey to ascertain the perspectives of 133 clinicians across the United Kingdom regarding the acceptability of an AI tool that triages MRI brain scans into 'normal' and 'abnormal'. As part of this survey, we supplied clinicians with information on training and validation case numbers, model performance, validation using unseen data, and explainability saliency maps. With regards to the specific use case of AI in MRI brain scans, 71% of respondents preferred the use of an AI-assisted triage compared to the current system without triage, typically chronologically. Notably, information that explained and helped visualise the AI model's decision making was found to improve clinician confidence. When shown a heatmap, 60% of participants felt more confident in the AI's decision. The results of this short communication demonstrate a positive support for the implementation of AI-assistive tools in triage.",

    "abstract": "Eutrophication is one of the most relevant concerns due to the risk to water supply and food security. Nitrogen and phosphorus chemical species concentrations determined the risk and magnitude of eutrophication. These analyses are even more relevant in basins with intensive agriculture due to agrochemical discharges. However, analyzing these nutrients is labor intensive, as sampling to intercalibration in the laboratory requires considerable financial and human resources. Currently, artificial intelligence allows the modeling of phenomena and variables in various fields. This research focuses on the exploration of other machine learning methods, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and random forest (RF) for the estimation of nutrients in surface waters of Sinaloa, Mexico (11 model basins), the states with the highest exports of agricultural products. Nutrients were considered in all possible chemical forms, such as total nitrogen, Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus, and orthophosphate. For estimation, the selected input parameters are characterized by pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, water temperature, and total suspended solids, which do not require chemical reagents and can be measured in real time. The parameter information was obtained from the National Network for Water Quality Monitoring database (6,200 data recorded since 2012). Finally, hyperparameter normalization and optimization (HPO) methods were implemented to maximize the best-performing model. Each model obtained different coefficient of determination values (R2): MLP between 0.64 and 0.77, CNN from 0.65 to 0.76, KNN from 0.64 to 0.79, and RF from 0.79 to 0.85. The latter is considered the best performer, with values of 0.95 in training and 0.94 in validation after applying HPO. Notably, the models are valid for any surface water body and in any climatic season in the state of Sinaloa, M\u00e9xico. Therefore decision-makers can use them for science-based environmental regulation of land use and pesticide application.",

    "abstract": "Human cognitive abilities exhibit positive interrelationships that can be represented by a latent general intelligence factor (g). Differentiation hypotheses propose that there are systematic interindividual differences in the strength of g, specifically along the dimensions of ability level (ability differentiation) and age (age differentiation). Despite the potential implications for cognitive theory and assessment, the available evidence on the matter is inconclusive. We present comprehensive analyses of differentiation effects across the lifespan, drawing on the meta-analytic integration of nonlinear factor analyses with German standardization samples (",

    "abstract": "Current heart failure (HF) risk stratification strategies require comprehensive clinical evaluation. In this study, artificial intelligence (AI) applied to electrocardiogram (ECG) images was examined as a strategy to predict HF risk.\nAcross multinational cohorts in the Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS), UK Biobank (UKB), and Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil), individuals without baseline HF were followed for the first HF hospitalization. An AI-ECG model that defines cross-sectional left ventricular systolic dysfunction from 12-lead ECG images was used, and its association with incident HF was evaluated. Discrimination was assessed using Harrell's C-statistic. Pooled cohort equations to prevent HF (PCP-HF) were used as a comparator.\nAmong 231 285 YNHHS patients, 4472 had primary HF hospitalizations over 4.5 years (inter-quartile range 2.5-6.6). In UKB and ELSA-Brasil, among 42 141 and 13 454 people, 46 and 31 developed HF over 3.1 (2.1-4.5) and 4.2 (3.7-4.5) years. A positive AI-ECG screen portended a 4- to 24-fold higher risk of new-onset HF [age-, sex-adjusted hazard ratio: YNHHS, 3.88 (95% confidence interval 3.63-4.14); UKB, 12.85 (6.87-24.02); ELSA-Brasil, 23.50 (11.09-49.81)]. The association was consistent after accounting for comorbidities and the competing risk of death. Higher probabilities were associated with progressively higher HF risk. Model discrimination was 0.718 in YNHHS, 0.769 in UKB, and 0.810 in ELSA-Brasil. In YNHHS and ELSA-Brasil, incorporating AI-ECG with PCP-HF yielded a significant improvement in discrimination over PCP-HF alone.\nAn AI model applied to a single ECG image defined the risk of future HF, representing a digital biomarker for stratifying HF risk.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered platforms may be used to ensure that clinically significant lung nodules receive appropriate management. We studied the impact of a commercially available AI natural language processing tool on detection of clinically significant indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) based on radiology reports and provision of guideline-consistent care.\nAll computed tomography (CT) scans performed at a single tertiary care center in the outpatient or emergency room setting between 20-Feb-2024 and 20-March-2024 were processed by the AI natural language processing algorithm. CT radiology reports mentioning a lung nodule or focal indeterminate lesion were flagged. All flagged reports were reviewed by a lung nodule expert two weeks after nodule identification. IPNs were classified as \"appropriately followed\" if follow-up imaging, referral to a nodule clinic, or other guideline-consistent care was ordered. IPNs were classified as \"not appropriately followed\" if no acknowledgement of the reported nodule was documented in the electronic health record within two weeks of being flagged.\nThe AI software processed 76,507 unique radiology reports, identified 2,585 CT scans with chest imaging, and found 389 IPNs. Review determined that 272 (70%) nodules were appropriately followed while 117 (30%) were not appropriately followed. Of the 117 nodules without documented follow-up, 67 (57%) were > 8mm and 24 (20.5%) were > 15mm. IPNs that would not have received follow-up in the absence of the AI software generated 43 additional clinical appointments and 3 procedures.\nAt a large tertiary care center, 30% of clinically significant incidental pulmonary nodules that would have otherwise been missed were brought to the attention of lung nodule clinicians by an AI software, allowing for initiation of appropriate follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to shape the future of medical practice. The perspective and understanding of medical students are critical for guiding the development of educational curricula and training.\nThis study aims to assess and compare medical AI-related attitudes among medical students in general medicine and in one of the visually oriented fields (pathology), along with illuminating their anticipated role of AI in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-enhanced health care.\nThis was a cross-sectional study that used a web-based survey composed of a closed-ended questionnaire. The survey addressed medical students at all educational levels across the 5 public medical schools, along with pathology residents in 4 residency programs in Jordan.\nA total of 394 respondents participated (328 medical students and 66 pathology residents). The majority of respondents (272/394, 69%) were already aware of AI and deep learning in medicine, mainly relying on websites for information on AI, while only 14% (56/394) were aware of AI through medical schools. There was a statistically significant difference in awareness among respondents who consider themselves tech experts compared with those who do not (P=.03). More than half of the respondents believed that AI could be used to diagnose diseases automatically (213/394, 54.1% agreement), with medical students agreeing more than pathology residents (P=.04). However, more than one-third expressed fear about recent AI developments (167/394, 42.4% agreed). Two-thirds of respondents disagreed that their medical schools had educated them about AI and its potential use (261/394, 66.2% disagreed), while 46.2% (182/394) expressed interest in learning about AI in medicine. In terms of pathology-specific questions, 75.4% (297/394) agreed that AI could be used to identify pathologies in slide examinations automatically. There was a significant difference between medical students and pathology residents in their agreement (P=.001). Overall, medical students and pathology trainees had similar responses.\nAI education should be introduced into medical school curricula to improve medical students' understanding and attitudes. Students agreed that they need to learn about AI's applications, potential hazards, and legal and ethical implications. This is the first study to analyze medical students' views and awareness of AI in Jordan, as well as the first to include pathology residents' perspectives. The findings are consistent with earlier research internationally. In comparison with prior research, these attitudes are similar in low-income and industrialized countries, highlighting the need for a global strategy to introduce AI instruction to medical students everywhere in this era of rapidly expanding technology.",

There was a statistically significant difference in awareness among respondents who consider themselves tech experts compared with those who do not (P=.03). More than half of the respondents believed that AI could be used to diagnose diseases automatically (213/394, 54.1% agreement), with medical students agreeing more than pathology residents (P=.04). However, more than one-third expressed fear about recent AI developments (167/394, 42.4% agreed). Two-thirds of respondents disagreed that their medical schools had educated them about AI and its potential use (261/394, 66.2% disagreed), while 46.2% (182/394) expressed interest in learning about AI in medicine. In terms of pathology-specific questions, 75.4% (297/394) agreed that AI could be used to identify pathologies in slide examinations automatically. There was a significant difference between medical students and pathology residents in their agreement (P=.001). Overall, medical students and pathology trainees had similar responses.",

    "abstract": "Problem-solving skills are some of the leading strategies for dynamism in the content and quality of nursing care.\nThe present study is aimed at determining nursing students' problem-solving, solution-focused thinking, and emotional intelligence levels and investigating the relationship between their problem-solving skills and these variables.\nThe study comprised 305 nursing students in Turkey. Data were collected between May and June 2021, using the personal information form, problem-solving inventory, solution-focused inventory and Schutte emotional intelligence scale. One-way ANOVA, t-test and multiple regression were used for data analysis.\nThe mean age of the participants was 21.81\u2009\u00b1\u20095.93 years, 75.7% of them were women, 35.1% were senior students and 58.0% perceived their academic achievement as moderate. The mean scores from the overall problem-solving inventory, solution-focused inventory, and emotional intelligence scale were 92.93\u2009\u00b1\u200919.30, 50.26\u2009\u00b1\u20098.43 and 128.22\u2009\u00b1\u200914.11, respectively. Variables such as sex, perceived academic achievement, emotional intelligence and solution-focused thinking levels affected problem-solving skills (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The effective predictive factors accounted for 50.2% of the change in participants' problem-solving skill levels.\nFor this reason, revising the national nursing curriculum with programmes that develop emotional intelligence and solution-focused thinking skills will enable nursing students to better manage the nursing process in clinical and field practices.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in many medical specialties. However, nephrology has lagged in adopting and incorporating machine learning techniques. Nephrology is well positioned to capitalize on the benefits of AI. The abundance of structured clinical data, combined with the mathematical nature of this specialty, makes it an attractive option for AI applications. AI can also play a significant role in addressing health inequities, especially in organ transplantation. It has also been used to detect rare diseases such as Fabry disease early. This review article aims to increase awareness on the basic concepts in machine learning and discuss AI applications in nephrology. It also addresses the challenges in integrating AI into clinical practice and the need for creating an AI-competent nephrology workforce. Even though AI will not replace nephrologists, those who are able to incorporate AI into their practice effectively will undoubtedly provide better care to their patients. The integration of AI technology is no longer just an option but a necessity for staying ahead in the field of nephrology. Finally, AI can contribute as a force multiplier in transitioning to a value-based care model.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances of artificial intelligence (AI) in retinal imaging found its application in two major categories: discriminative and generative AI. For discriminative tasks, conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are still major AI techniques. Vision transformers (ViT), inspired by the transformer architecture in natural language processing, has emerged as useful techniques for discriminating retinal images. ViT can attain excellent results when pretrained at sufficient scale and transferred to specific tasks with fewer images, compared to conventional CNN. Many studies found better performance of ViT, compared to CNN, for common tasks such as diabetic retinopathy screening on color fundus photographs (CFP) and segmentation of retinal fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is the main AI technique in generative AI in retinal imaging. Novel images generated by GAN can be applied for training AI models in imbalanced or inadequate datasets. Foundation models are also recent advances in retinal imaging. They are pretrained with huge datasets, such as millions of CFP and OCT images and fine-tuned for downstream tasks with much smaller datasets. A foundation model, RETFound, which was self-supervised and found to discriminate many eye and systemic diseases better than supervised models. Large language models are foundation models that may be applied for text-related tasks, like reports of retinal angiography. Whereas AI technology moves forward fast, real-world use of AI models moves slowly, making the gap between development and deployment even wider. Strong evidence showing AI models can prevent visual loss may be required to close this gap.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) frequently results in persistent motor, sensory, or autonomic dysfunction, and the outcomes are largely determined by the location and severity of the injury. Despite significant technological progress, the intricate nature of the spinal cord anatomy and the difficulties associated with neuroregeneration make full recovery from SCI uncommon. This review explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI), with a particular focus on machine learning, to enhance patient outcomes in SCI management. The application of AI, specifically machine learning, has revolutionized the diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and rehabilitation of patients with SCI. By leveraging large datasets and identifying complex patterns, AI contributes to improved diagnostic accuracy, optimizes surgical procedures, and enables the personalization of therapeutic interventions. AI-driven prognostic models provide accurate predictions of recovery, facilitating improved planning and resource allocation. Additionally, AI-powered rehabilitation systems, including robotic devices and brain-computer interfaces, increase the effectiveness and accessibility of therapy. However, realizing the full potential of AI in SCI care requires ongoing research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the development of comprehensive datasets. As AI continues to evolve, it is expected to play an increasingly vital role in enhancing the outcomes of patients with SCI.",

    "abstract": "General practice/family medicine is a primary healthcare discipline that focuses on providing comprehensive, patient-centered care to individuals and families across their lifespan. This study aimed to assess the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in general practice/family medicine regarding the 12 characteristics of its discipline as described in the recently revised European Definition of General Practice/Family Medicine. AI has the potential to revolutionize family medicine practice by improving the accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness of various clinical tasks. From diagnostic decision-making to chronic condition management and clinical workflow optimization, AI-powered tools offer a range of benefits for patients and clinicians. However, appropriate education and training of the primary healthcare providers are deemed necessary to maximize benefits and minimize potential pitfalls. To ensure efficient and safe integration of AI in medical practice, important implications regarding privacy, malpractice, bias, autonomy, and overtreatment should also be addressed. AI application should be treated as a practical, assistive tool for the clinician, that can hardly take over decision-making and cannot replace the doctor-patient relationship.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare are growing exponentially. The field of neurosurgery is particularly suited to implement AI solutions given its technology-driven nature. It is of paramount importance to understand the basics of AI to make informed decision on how to shape current and future applications.\nWhat is the level of confidence, knowledge and the attitude of the global neurosurgical community towards AI basic concepts and applications?\nA 24-item survey was designed and distributed. The survey results reported on level of knowledge, confidence and interest in AI, perspectives and attitude towards the application of AI technologies in neurosurgery. The potential influence of demographics and work-related environment features on AI knowledge was investigated.\nWe received a total of 250 responses from 61 countries. The correct definition of 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning' and main Big Data features were identified by respectively 42%, 23% and 23% of the respondents. The survey unveiled a strong interest and a positive attitude towards the introduction of AI in the neurosurgical practice. The main concerns included trustworthiness and liability, the main barriers to implementation were considered lack of funding, infrastructure, knowledge and multidisciplinary collaboration.\nThere is a low familiarity with basic AI concepts in the neurosurgical community. Nevertheless, there is a strong interest and a positive attitude towards AI implementation. The systematization of training and the production of educational resources will be key in guaranteeing a successful implementation of AI in the evolving history of neurosurgery.",

    "abstract": "It is being increasingly recognized that the strategic use of artificial intelligence (AI) can catalyze the process of manuscript writing. However, it is imperative that we recognize the hidden biases, pitfalls, and disadvantages of relying solely on AI, such as accuracy concerns and the potential erosion of nuanced human insight. With an emphasis on crafting effective prompts and inputs, this article reveals how to navigate the labyrinth of AI capabilities to create a good-quality manuscript. It also addresses the evolving guidelines from various publishers, shedding light on how to \"leverage the digital genie\" responsibly and ethically. We further explore how and which AI tools can be harnessed for literature reviews, executing statistical analyses, and polishing the language of the manuscript. Providing practical strategies for maximizing AI's benefits, this article underscores the indispensable value of human creativity and critical thinking, stressing that while AI can \"streamline the mundane,\" the author's insight remains vital for profound intellectual contributions.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are driving innovation in biosciences and are already affecting key elements of medical scholarship and clinical care. Many schools of medicine are capitalizing on the promise of these new technologies by establishing academic units to catalyze and grow research and innovation in AI/ML. At Stanford University, we have developed a successful model for an AI/ML research center with support from academic leaders, clinical departments, extramural grants, and industry partners. The Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging uses the following 4 key tactics to support AI/ML research: project-based learning opportunities that build interdisciplinary collaboration; internal grant programs that catalyze extramural funding; infrastructure that facilitates the rapid creation of large multimodal AI-ready clinical data sets; and educational and open data programs that engage the broader research community. The center is based on the premise that foundational and applied research are not in tension but instead are complementary. Solving important biomedical problems with AI/ML requires high-quality foundational team science that incorporates the knowledge and expertise of clinicians, clinician scientists, computer scientists, and data scientists. As AI/ML becomes an essential component of research and clinical care, multidisciplinary centers of excellence in AI/ML will become a key part of the scholarly portfolio of academic medical centers and will provide a foundation for the responsible, ethical, and fair implementation of AI/ML systems.",

    "abstract": "A novel ring-gantry cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging system shows improved image quality compared to its conventional version, but its effect on autosegmentation is unknown. This study evaluates the impact of this high-performance CBCT on autosegmentation performance, inter-observer variability, contour correction times and delineation confidence, compared to the conventional CBCT.\nTwenty prostate cancer patients were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. Per patient, one pair of high-performance CBCT and conventional CBCT scans was included. Three observers manually corrected contours generated by the artificial intelligence (AI) model for prostate, seminal vesicles, bladder, rectum and bowel. Differences between AI-based and manual corrected contours were quantified using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile of Hausdorff distance (HD95). Autosegmentation performance and interobserver variation were compared using a random effects model; correction times and confidence scores using a paired \nAutosegmentation performance showed small, but statistically insignificant differences. Interobserver variability, assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient, was significantly different across most organs, but these were considered clinically irrelevant (maximum difference\u00a0=\u00a00.08). Mean contour correction times were similar for both CBCT systems (11:03 versus 11:12\u00a0min; p\u00a0=\u00a00.66). Delineation confidence scores were significantly higher with the high-performance CBCT scans for prostate, seminal vesicles and rectum (4.5 versus 3.5, 4.3 versus 3.5, 4.8 versus 4.3; all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nThe high-performance CBCT did not (clinically) improve autosegmentation performance, inter-observer variability or contour correction time compared to conventional CBCT. However, it clearly enhanced user confidence in organ delineation for prostate, seminal vesicles and rectum.",

    "abstract": "Drugs that interact with multiple therapeutic targets are potential high-value products in polypharmacology-based drug discovery, but the rational design remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to design the chemical structures of compounds that interact with multiple therapeutic target proteins. The molecular structure generation is performed by a fragment-based approach using a genetic algorithm with chemical substructures and a deep learning approach using reinforcement learning with stochastic policy gradients in the framework of generative adversarial networks. Using the proposed methods, we designed the chemical structures of compounds that would interact with two therapeutic targets of bronchial asthma, i.e., adenosine A2a receptor (ADORA2A) and phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D). We then synthesized 10 compounds and evaluated their\u00a0bioactivities via the binding assays of 39 target human proteins, including ADORA2A and PDE4D. Three of the 10 synthesized compounds successfully interacted with ADORA2A and PDE4D with high specificity.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing medical writing by enhancing the efficiency and precision of healthcare communication and health research. This review explores the transformative integration of AI in medical writing, highlighting its dual role of enhancing efficiency while maintaining the crucial elements of human expertise. AI technologies, including natural language processing and AI-driven literature review tools, have significantly advanced, facilitating rapid draft generation, literature summarization, and consistency in medical documentation. Key applications include aiding study design, enhancing content drafting, and optimizing literature reviews through specific AI tools. Moreover, this review delves into practical applications of AI in the context of lower extremity wounds, specifically ischemic leg ulcers, demonstrating how AI can streamline the synthesis of relevant literature. While AI presents notable advantages, it also raises ethical concerns, such as potential biases and data privacy issues, highlighting the need for human oversight in the writing process. A proposed future framework suggests that AI could take over routine tasks, allowing medical writers to devote more attention to analytical and ethical aspects. Additionally, there is a strong need for further research on the cost-effectiveness of both clinical trials utilizing AI interventions and the incorporation of AI in medical writing. Ultimately, balancing the integration of AI in medical writing promises to improve both healthcare communication and health research, ensuring the production of high-quality, patient-centric and research-focused content.",

    "abstract": "Single-subject voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a powerful technique for reader-independent detection of brain atrophy in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to support the (differential) diagnosis and staging of neurodegenerative diseases in individual patients. However, VBM is sensitive to the MRI scanner platform and details of the acquisition sequence. To mitigate this limitation, we recently proposed and \nClinical validation of CNN-based VBM.\nCNN-based VBM was compared with conventional VBM based on a mixed-scanner normative database in 227 consecutive patients (66.0\u2009\u00b1\u20099.6 years, 53.3% female) with suspected dementing neurodegenerative disease. VBM maps were interpreted visually by two experienced readers, first with respect to the presence of any neurodegenerative disease, then for the differentiation between Alzheimer's disease (AD)-typical and non-AD atrophy patterns. A Likert 6-score was used for both tasks. Simultaneously acquired positron emission tomography (PET) with \nRepeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant impact of the VBM method on the visual detection of any neurodegenerative disease (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Balanced accuracy/sensitivity/specificity were 80.4/86.3/74.5% for CNN-based VBM versus 75.7/79.5/71.8% for conventional VBM. Differentiation between AD and non-AD typical atrophy patterns did not differ between both VBM methods (p\u2009=\u20090.871).\nCNN-based VBM provides clinically useful accuracy for the detection of neurodegeneration-suspect atrophy with higher sensitivity than conventional VBM with a mixed-scanner normative reference database and without compromising specificity.",

    "abstract": "Pre-injury frailty has been investigated as a tool to predict outcomes of older trauma patients. Using artificial intelligence principles of machine learning, we aimed to identify a \"signature\" (combination of clinical variables) that could predict which older adults are at risk of fall-related hospital admission. We hypothesized that frailty, measured using the 5-item modified Frailty Index, could be utilized in combination with other factors as a predictor of admission for fall-related injuries.\nThe National Readmission Database was mined to identify factors associated with admission of older adults for fall-related injuries. Older adults admitted for trauma-related injuries from 2010 to 2014 were included. Age, sex, number of chronic conditions and past fall-related admission, comorbidities, 5-item modified Frailty Index, and medical insurance status were included in the analysis. Two machine learning models were selected among six tested models (logistic regression and random forest). Using a decision tree as a surrogate model for random forest, we extracted high-risk combinations of factors associated with admission for fall-related injury.\nOur approach yielded 18 models. Being a woman was one of the factors most often associated with admission for fall-related injuries. Frailty appeared in four of the 18 combinations. Being a woman, aged 65-74\u2009years and presenting a 5-item modified Frailty Index score >3 predicted admission for fall-related injuries in 80.3% of this population.\nUsing artificial intelligence principles of machine learning, we were able to develop 18 signatures allowing us to identify older adults at risk of admission for fall-related injuries. Future studies using other databases, such as TQIP, are warranted to validate our high-risk combination models. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2025; \u2022\u2022: \u2022\u2022-\u2022\u2022.",

    "abstract": "Systematic review.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) models have recently emerged as tools to improve fracture detection, mainly through imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and radiographs. This systematic review evaluates the diagnostic performance of AI and DL models in detecting cervical spine fractures and assesses their potential role in clinical practice.\nA systematic search of PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted for studies published between January 2000 and July 2024. Studies that evaluated AI models for cervical spine fracture detection were included. Diagnostic performance metrics were extracted and included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve. The PROBAST tool assessed bias, and PRISMA criteria were used for study selection and reporting.\nEleven studies published between 2021 and 2024 were included in the review. AI models demonstrated variable performance, with sensitivity ranging from 54.9% to 100% and specificity from 72% to 98.6%. Models applied to CT imaging generally outperformed those applied to radiographs, with convolutional neural networks (CNN) and advanced architectures such as MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformer (ViT) achieving the highest accuracy. However, most studies lacked external validation, raising concerns about the generalizability of their findings.\nAI and DL models show significant potential in improving fracture detection, particularly in CT imaging. While these models offer high diagnostic accuracy, further validation and refinement are necessary before they can be widely integrated into clinical practice. AI should complement, rather than replace, human expertise in diagnostic workflows.",

    "abstract": "Investigators conducting clinical trials have an ethical, scientific, and regulatory obligation to protect the safety of trial participants. Traditionally, safety monitoring includes manual review and coding of adverse event data by expert clinicians.\nOur study explores the use of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to streamline and standardize clinician coding of adverse event data in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials.\nOur quantitative retrospective study aimed to develop a gold standard AD adverse event data set, evaluate the predictive performance of NLP-based models to classify adverse events, and determine whether automated coding is more efficient, accurate, reliable, and consistent than clinician coding.\nOur study was conducted at the University of Southern California's Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute (ATRI). ATRI serves as the clinical and data coordinating center for the Alzheimer's Clinical Trial Consortium (ACTC).\nWe collected demographic and adverse event data from eight completed clinical trials in participants (n=1920) with symptomatic AD conducted between 2005 and 2020.\nOriginal expert clinician-confirmed codes were used for all model performance comparisons. F1 score was used as the primary model selection metric. Final classifier performance was evaluated using predictive accuracy. Clinician effort was measured in time to code, review, and confirm coded adverse events.\nIn a sample of 1000 adverse events, AI-based AE coding achieved higher accuracy (\u223c20% increase in accuracy) and was more cost-effective (\u223c80% cost reduction) than traditional clinician coding.\nOur study results demonstrate how approaches that effectively combine AI and human expertise can improve the efficiency and quality of adverse event coding and clinical trial safety monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Visual assessment of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is time-consuming, influenced by reader experience and prone to interobserver variability. This study evaluated a novel algorithm for coronary stenosis quantification (atherosclerosis imaging quantitative CT, AI-QCT).\nThe study included 208 patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing CCTA in Perfusion Imaging and CT Coronary Angiography With Invasive Coronary Angiography-1. AI-QCT and blinded readers assessed coronary artery stenosis following the Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System consensus. Accuracy of AI-QCT was compared with a level 3 and two level 2 clinical readers against an invasive quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) reference standard (\u226550% stenosis) in an area under the curve (AUC) analysis, evaluated per-patient and per-vessel and stratified by plaque volume.\nAmong 208 patients with a mean age of 58\u00b19 years and 37% women, AI-QCT demonstrated superior concordance with QCA compared with clinical CCTA assessments. For the detection of obstructive stenosis (\u226550%), AI-QCT achieved an AUC of 0.91 on a per-patient level, outperforming level 3 (AUC 0.77; p<0.002) and level 2 readers (AUC 0.79; p<0.001 and AUC 0.76; p<0.001). The advantage of AI-QCT was most prominent in those with above median plaque volume. At the per-vessel level, AI-QCT achieved an AUC of 0.86, similar to level 3 (AUC 0.82; p=0.098) stenosis, but superior to level 2 readers (both AUC 0.69; p<0.001).\nAI-QCT demonstrated superior agreement with invasive QCA compared to clinical CCTA assessments, particularly compared to level 2 readers in those with extensive CAD. Integrating AI-QCT into routine clinical practice holds promise for improving the accuracy of stenosis quantification through CCTA.",

    "abstract": "Although smartphone-based devices have been developed to record 1-lead ECG, existing solutions for automatic atrial fibrillation (AF) detection often has poor positive predictive value.\nThis study aimed to validate a cloud-based deep learning platform for automatic AF detection in a large cohort of patients using 1-lead ECG records.\nWe analyzed 8,528 patients with 30-second ECG records from a single-lead handheld ECG device. Ground truth for AF presence was established through a benchmark algorithm and expert manual labeling. The Willem Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform, not trained on these ECGs, was used for automatic arrhythmia detection, including AF. A rules-based algorithm was also used for comparison. An expert cardiology committee reviewed false positives and negatives and performance metrics were computed.\nThe AI platform achieved an accuracy of 96.1% (initial labels) and 96.4% (expert review), with sensitivities of 83.3% and 84.2%, and specificities of 97.3% and 97.6%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 75.2% and 78.0%, and the negative predictive value was 98.4%. Performance of the AI platform largely exceeded the performance of the rules-based algorithm for all metrics. The AI also detected other arrhythmias, such as premature ventricular complexes, premature atrial complexes along with 1-degree atrioventricular blocks.\nThe result of this external validation indicates that the AI platform can match cardiologist-level accuracy in AF detection from 1-lead ECGs. Such tools are promising for AF screening and has the potential to improve accuracy in non-cardiology expert healthcare professional interpretation and trigger further tests for effective patient management.",

    "abstract": "Surveys to assess views about artificial intelligence (AI) of various diagnostic radiology constituencies have revealed interesting combinations of enthusiasm, caution, and implementation priorities. We surveyed academic radiology leaders about their views on AI and how they intend to approach AI implementation in their departments.\nWe conducted a web survey of Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments (SCARD) members between October 5 and October 31, 2023 to solicit optimism or pessimism about AI, target use cases, planned implementation, and perceptions of their workforce. P-values are provided only for descriptive purposes and have not been adjusted for multiple testing in this exploratory research.\nThe survey was sent to the 112 SCARD members and 43 responded (38%). Chairs were optimistic, with no statistical difference between views of AI in general versus generative AI.

    "abstract": "To investigate the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in emergency medicine, focusing on its utility in triaging and managing acute gynecologic and obstetric emergencies.\nThis feasibility study assessed Chat-GPT's performance in triaging and recommending management interventions for gynecologic and obstetric emergencies, using ten fictive cases. Five common conditions were modeled for each specialty. Chat-GPT was tasked with proposing triage classifications and providing immediate management recommendations. Human experts independently reviewed each case, classified triage categories, and proposed management. Following this, experts evaluated Chat-GPT's recommendations, rating the AI's responses on accuracy and clinical applicability.\nChat-GPT's recommendations demonstrated high concordance with human evaluators. Chat-GPT's triage classifications matched those of human experts in most cases, though minor discrepancies in urgency ratings were observed. The A\u00cds suggestions were mostly rated as \"very good\" to \"excellent.\" While Chat-GPT consistently delivered appropriate responses, some human evaluators noted slight differences in perceived urgency.\nThis study highlights Chat-GPT's potential as a clinical support tool in emergency medicine. Chat-GPT provided structured, evidence-based recommendations comparable to those of experienced clinicians, especially for high-stakes gynecologic and obstetric emergencies. Although encouraging, these results highlight the value of utilizing AI in addition to human knowledge, as variations in urgency ratings and management nuances highlight the necessity of human supervision in crucial decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Transformative change is needed across the food system to improve health and environmental outcomes. As food, nutrition, environmental and health data are generated beyond human scale, there is an opportunity for technological tools to support multifactorial, integrated, scalable approaches to address the complexities of dietary behaviour change. Responsible technology could act as a mechanistic conduit between research, policy, industry and society, enabling timely, informed decision making and action by all stakeholders across the food system. Domain expertise in food, nutrition and health should always be integrated into both the development and continuous deployment of AI-powered nutritional intelligence (NI) to ensure it is responsible, accurate, safe, useable and effective. Dietary behaviours are complex and improving diet-related health outcomes requires socio-cultural-demographic considerations within the design and deployment of NI tools. This article describes existing examples of NI within the food system and future opportunities. Human-in-the-loop approaches with food, health and nutrition experts involved at all stages including data acquisition, processing, output validation and ongoing quality assurance are essential to ensure evidence-based practice. The same ethical considerations should apply in this domain as in any other (e.g. privacy, inclusivity, robustness, transparency and accountability) and responsible practice must encompass rigorous standards and alignment with regulatory frameworks. Critical today and in the future is accessibility to appropriate high-quality food compositional data sets, which include up-to-date information on commercially available products that reflect the constantly evolving food landscape to realise the potential of responsible AI to help address the existing food system challenges.",

This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of responses provided by different AI chatbots to questions that dentists might ask regarding regenerative endodontic treatment (RET), a procedure that shows promising biological healing potential.\nA total of 23 questions related to RET procedures were developed based on the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) 2022 guidelines. These questions were presented to three platforms: Google Bard (Gemini), ChatGPT-4o, and ChatGPT-4 with a PDF plugin. The questions were asked three times a day over the course of 10 days by two different researchers. The responses obtained were categorized as correct, incorrect, or insufficient according to the guidelines, and the results were statistically analyzed.\nA total of 1,380 responses were collected from the three platforms. Statistical analysis revealed significant relationships between the responses given by the platforms during morning, noon, and evening sessions (p\u2009<\u20090.05). ChatGPT-4 with the PDF plugin had the highest correct response rate (98.1%), while Gemini depicted the lowest (48%).\nWhile ChatGPT-4o and Gemini offer promising results for regenerative endodontic clinical applications, they do not provide sufficient guidance.

    "abstract": "Skin diseases impact millions of people around the world and pose a severe risk to public health. These diseases have a wide range of effects on the skin's structure, functionality, and appearance. Identifying and predicting skin diseases are laborious processes that require a complete physical examination, a review of the patient's medical history, and proper laboratory diagnostic testing. Additionally, it necessitates a significant number of histological and clinical characteristics for examination and subsequent treatment. As a disease's complexity and quantity of features grow, identifying and predicting it becomes more challenging. This research proposes a deep learning (DL) model utilizing transfer learning (TL) to quickly identify skin diseases like chickenpox, measles, and monkeypox. A pre-trained VGG16 is used for transfer learning. The VGG16 can identify and predict diseases more quickly by learning symptom patterns. Images of the skin from the four classes of chickenpox, measles, monkeypox, and normal are included in the dataset. The dataset is separated into training and testing. The experimental results performed on the dataset demonstrate that the VGG16 model can identify and predict skin diseases with 93.29% testing accuracy. However, the VGG16 model does not explain why and how the system operates because deep learning models are black boxes. Deep learning models' opacity stands in the way of their widespread application in the healthcare sector. In order to make this a valuable system for the health sector, this article employs layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to determine the relevance scores of each input. The identified symptoms provide valuable insights that could support timely diagnosis and treatment decisions for skin diseases.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into dental imaging has led to significant advancements, particularly in the analysis of panoramic radiographs, also known as orthopantomograms (OPGs). One emerging application of AI is in determining gender from these radiographs, a task traditionally performed by forensic experts using manual methods. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the accuracy of AI algorithms in gender determination using OPGs, focusing on the reliability and potential clinical and forensic applications of these technologies. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. The study included research articles that utilised AI algorithms for gender detection based on OPG images. Five major databases were searched, and studies were selected based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The analysis focused on studies that reported accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of AI models. Statistical analyses were performed using R software, including forest plots and funnel plots, to evaluate the diagnostic performance and potential publication bias. The meta-analysis included 13 studies, yielding a pooled accuracy estimate of 88.66%. The results demonstrated high specificity among the AI models, with some studies achieving accuracy rates as high as 99.20%. However, there was variability in sensitivity across different studies, indicating that some models are more reliable than others depending on the dataset and features used. The funnel plot analysis suggested slight asymmetry, indicating potential publication bias or heterogeneity. AI models show significant potential in accurately determining gender from OPG images, with some models achieving near-perfect accuracy. Continued research is needed to enhance model consistency and expand the applicability of these tools across different demographic groups.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing our ability to identify and interpret genetic variants associated with coagulation factor deficiencies. This review introduces AI, with a specific focus on machine learning (ML) methods, and examines its applications in the field of coagulation genetics over the past decade. We observed a significant increase in AI-related publications, with a focus on hemophilia A and B. ML approaches have shown promise in predicting the functional impact of genetic variants and establishing genotype-phenotype correlations, exemplified by tools like \"Hema-Class\" for FVIII variants. However, some challenges remain, including the need to expand variant selection beyond missense mutations (which is now the standard of most studies). For the future, the integration of AI in calling, detecting, and interpreting genetic variants can significantly improve our ability to process large-scale genomic data. In this frame, we discuss various AI/ML-based tools for genetic variant detection and interpretation, highlighting their strengths and limitations. As the field evolves, the synergistic application of multiple AI models, coupled with rigorous validation strategies, will be crucial in advancing our understanding of coagulation disorders and for personalizing treatment approaches.",

In this paper, we explore the transformative potential of TinyML in facilitating pervasive, low-power cardiovascular monitoring and real-time analytics for patients with cardiac anomalies, leveraging wearable devices as the primary interface. To begin with, we provide an overview of TinyML software and hardware enablers, accompanied by an examination of networking solutions such as Low-power Wide area network (LPWAN) that facilitate the seamless deployment of TinyML frameworks. Following this, we delve into the methodologies of knowledge distillation, quantization, and pruning, which represent the cornerstone strategies for optimizing machine learning models to operate efficiently within resource-constrained environments. Furthermore, our discussion extends to the role of efficient deep neural networks tailored specifically for cardiovascular monitoring on wearable devices with limited computational resources. Through a comprehensive review, we analyze the applications of prominent artificial neural network architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Autoencoders, Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), and Transformers in the domain of Electrocardiogram (ECG) analytics, shedding light on their efficacy and potential in advancing healthcare technology.",

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in academic settings has the potential to revolutionize learning experiences, enhance educational outcomes, and streamline academic processes. The aim of this research was to explore the perceptions of Lebanese health sciences students regarding the use of generative AI in higher education. A qualitative descriptive research design informed by descriptive phenomenology was employed. Semi-structured interviews were carried out among 23 health sciences students at one major private university in Beirut. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted over the period of 3\u2009months. The inductive thematic analysis generated two themes, and eight subthemes highlighting the benefits and concerns in using AI; customized, self-paced, and autonomous learning, improved language and writing skills, development of innovative concepts, enhanced efficiency, accuracy of information, overreliance on AI, equitable access, unclear policies. Results from this study emphasized the importance of combined efforts across sectors to close access gaps, encourage inclusiveness, and develop well framed policies that enable students to utilize these new technologies for their maximum benefits.",

    "abstract": "The widespread propagation of wireless communication devices, from smartphones and tablets to Internet of Things (IoT) systems, has become an integral part of modern life. However, the expansion of wireless technology has also raised public concern about the potential health risks associated with prolonged exposure to electromagnetic fields. Our objective is to determine the optimal machine learning model for constructing electric field strength maps across urban areas, enhancing the field of environmental monitoring with the aid of sensor-based data collection. Our machine learning models consist of a novel and comprehensive dataset collected from a network of strategically placed sensors, capturing not only electromagnetic field readings but also additional urban features, including population density, levels of urbanization, and specific building characteristics. This sensor-driven approach, coupled with explainable AI, enables us to identify key factors influencing electromagnetic exposure more accurately. The integration of IoT sensor data with machine learning opens the potential for creating highly detailed and dynamic electromagnetic pollution maps. These maps are not merely static snapshots; they offer researchers the ability to track trends over time, assess the effectiveness of mitigation efforts, and gain a deeper understanding of electromagnetic field distribution in urban environments. Through the extensive dataset, our models can yield highly accurate and dynamic electric field strength maps. For this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis involving 566 machine learning models across eight French cities: Lyon, Saint-\u00c9tienne, Clermont-Ferrand, Dijon, Nantes, Rouen, Lille, and Paris. The analysis incorporated six core approaches: k-Nearest Neighbors, XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Linear Regression. The findings underscore the superior predictive capabilities of ensemble methods such as Random Forests and XGBoost, which outperform individual models. Simpler approaches like Decision Trees and k-NN offer effective yet slightly less precise alternatives. Neural Networks, despite their complexity, highlight the potential for further refinement in this application. In addition, our results show that the machine learning models significantly outperform the linear regression baseline, demonstrating the added value of more complex techniques in this domain. Our SHAP analysis reveals that the feature importance rankings in tree-based machine learning models differ significantly from those in k-NN, neural network, and linear regression models.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing has elevated the demands for fault diagnosis in servo motors. Traditional diagnostic methods, which rely heavily on handcrafted features and expert knowledge, struggle to achieve efficient fault identification in complex industrial environments, particularly when faced with real-time performance and accuracy limitations. This paper proposes a novel fault diagnosis approach integrating multi-scale convolutional neural networks (MSCNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), and attention mechanisms to address these challenges. Furthermore, the proposed method is optimized for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices through knowledge distillation and model quantization. This approach significantly reduces the computational complexity of the model while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy, making it well suited for edge nodes in industrial IoT scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves efficient and accurate servo motor fault diagnosis on edge devices with excellent accuracy and inference speed.",

    "abstract": "Cystoscopy is necessary for diagnosing bladder cancer, but it has limitations in identifying ambiguous lesions, such as carcinoma in situ (CIS), which leads to a high recurrence rate of bladder cancer. With the significant advancements in deep learning in the medical field, several studies have explored its application in cystoscopy. This study aimed to utilize the VGG19 and Deeplab v3+ deep learning models to classify and segment cystoscope images, respectively.\nWe classified cystoscope images obtained from 772 patients based on morphology (normal, papillary, flat, mixed) and biopsy results (normal, Ta, T1, T2, CIS, etc.). Experienced urologists annotated and labeled the lesion areas and image categories. The classification model for bladder cancer lesion, annotated with pathological results, was developed using VGG19 with an additional fully connected layer, utilizing sparse categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. The Deeplab v3+ model was used for segmenting each morphological type of bladder cancer in the cystoscope images, employing the dice coefficient loss function. The classification model was evaluated using validation accuracy and correlation with biopsy results, while the segmentation model was assessed using the Intersection over Union (IoU) combined with binary accuracy.\nThe dataset was split into training and validation sets with a 4:1 ratio. The VGG19 classification model achieved an accuracy score of 0.912. The Deeplab v3+ segmentation model achieved an IoU of 0.833 and a binary accuracy of 0.951. Visual analysis revealed a high similarity between the lesions identified by Deeplab v3+ and those labeled by experts.\nIn this study, we applied two deep learning models using well-annotated datasets of cystoscopic images. Both VGG19 and Deeplab v3+ demonstrated high performance in classification and segmentation, respectively. These models can serve as valuable tools for bladder cancer research and may aid in the diagnosis of bladder cancer.",

    "abstract": "Determining the values of various properties for new bio-inks for 3D printing is a very important task in the design of new materials. For this purpose, a large number of experimental works have been consulted, and a database with more than 1200 bioprinting tests has been created. These tests cover different combinations of conditions in terms of print pressure, temperature, and needle values, for example. These data are difficult to deal with in terms of determining combinations of conditions to optimize the tests and analyze new options. The best model demonstrated a specificity (Sp) of 88.4% and a sensitivity (Sn) of 86.2% in the training series while achieving an Sp of 85.9% and an Sn of 80.3% in the external validation series. This model utilizes operators based on perturbation theory to analyze the complexity of the data. For comparative purposes, neural networks have been used, and very similar results have been obtained. The developed tool could easily be applied to predict the properties of bioprinting assays in silico. These findings could significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of predictive models in bioprinting without resorting to trial-and-error tests, thereby saving time and funds. Ultimately, this tool may help pave the way for advances in personalized medicine and tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "This narrative review explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into nursing informatics\u00a0and examines its impact on nursing practice, healthcare delivery, education, and policy.\nNursing informatics, which merges nursing science with information management and communication technologies, is crucial in modern healthcare. The emergence of AI presents opportunities to improve diagnostics, treatment, and healthcare resource management. However, integrating AI into nursing practice also brings challenges, including ethical concerns and the need for specialized training.\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 2013 to December 2023 using databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. Articles were selected based on their relevance to AI's role in nursing informatics, particularly in enhancing patient care and healthcare efficiency.\nAI significantly enhances nursing practice by improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing care plans, and supporting resource allocation. However, its adoption raises ethical issues, such as data privacy concerns and biases within AI algorithms. Ensuring that nurses are adequately trained in AI technologies is essential for safe and effective integration.\nPolicymakers should promote AI literacy programs for healthcare professionals and develop ethical guidelines to govern the use of AI in healthcare. This will ensure that AI tools are implemented responsibly, protecting patient rights and enhancing healthcare outcomes.\nAI offers promising advancements in nursing informatics, leading to more efficient patient care and improved decision-making. Nonetheless, overcoming ethical challenges and ensuring AI literacy among nurses are critical steps for successful implementation.",

Ongoing advances in AI technology will lead to further expansion of its existing applications and more widespread use within the field of dentistry. The predicted transformation of current practice within dentistry brought about by AI necessitates the education of undergraduate dental students on the topic of AI. AI will act as a complementary tool to clinical expertise and skill, rather than a replacement. AI education frameworks should integrate with existing traditional dental education. It is important that dental students develop a sound understanding of the ethical considerations surrounding AI, ensuring its safe and responsible use. This article aims to consider the status of current undergraduate dental education and the possible impact of AI, examining both the challenges and opportunities, and the practicalities, of incorporating AI into existing undergraduate dental curricula. Understanding and envisioning the future landscape shaped by AI will allow for development of a future dental workforce who are skilled, confident and responsible AI users.",

    "abstract": "Integrating prior epidemiological knowledge embedded within mechanistic models with the data-mining capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential for epidemiological modeling. While the fusion of AI and traditional mechanistic approaches is rapidly advancing, efforts remain fragmented. This scoping review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging integrated models applied across the spectrum of infectious diseases. Through systematic search strategies, we identified 245 eligible studies from 15,460 records. Our review highlights the practical value of integrated models, including advances in disease forecasting, model parameterization, and calibration. However, key research gaps remain. These include the need for better incorporation of realistic decision-making considerations, expanded exploration of diverse datasets, and further investigation into biological and socio-behavioral mechanisms. Addressing these gaps will unlock the synergistic potential of AI and mechanistic modeling to enhance understanding of disease dynamics and support more effective public health planning and response.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this review is to evaluate the contributions of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART), focusing on its role in enhancing the processes and outcomes of fertility treatments. This study analyzed 48 relevant articles to assess the impact of AI on various aspects of ART, including treatment efficacy, process optimization, and outcome prediction. The effectiveness of different machine learning paradigms-supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning-in improving ART-related procedures was particularly examined. The findings indicate that AI technologies significantly enhance ART processes by refining tasks such as embryo and sperm analysis and facilitating personalized treatment plans based on predictive modeling. Notable improvements were observed in the accuracy of diagnosing and predicting successful outcomes in fertility treatments. AI-driven models provided more precise forecasts of the optimal timing for clinical interventions such as egg retrieval and embryo transfer, which are critical to the success of ART cycles. The integration of AI into ART represents a transformative advancement, substantially improving the precision and efficiency of fertility treatments. The continuous evolution of AI methodologies is likely to further revolutionize this field, enabling more tailored and successful treatment approaches. AI is becoming an indispensable tool in reproductive medicine, enhancing both the effectiveness of treatments and the clinical decision-making process. This review underscores the potential of AI to act as a catalyst for innovative solutions in the optimization of ART.",

    "abstract": "To conduct a scoping review on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in clear aligner therapy and to assess the extent of AI integration and automation in orthodontic software currently available to orthodontists.\nA systematic electronic literature search was performed in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. Also, grey literature resources up to March 2024 were reviewed. English-language studies on potential AI applications for clear aligner therapy were included based on an independent evaluation by two reviewers. An assessment of the automation steps in orthodontic software available on the market up to March 2024 was also conducted.\nOut of 708 studies, 41 were included. Sixteen articles focused on tooth segmentation, four on registration of digital models, 13 on digital setup, and eight on remote monitoring. Moreover, 13 aligner software programs were identified and assessed for their level of automation. Only one software demonstrated complete automation of the steps involved in the orthodontic digital workflow.\nNone of the 13 identified aligner software programs were evaluated in the 41 included studies. However, AI-based tooth segmentation achieved 98% accuracy, while AI effectively merged CBCT and IOS data, supported digital measurements, predicted treatment outcomes, and showed potential for remote monitoring.\nAI applications in clear aligner therapy are on the rise. This scoping review enables orthodontists to identify AI-based solutions in orthodontic planning and understand its implications, which can potentially enhance treatment efficiency, accuracy, and predictability.",

    "abstract": "To compare fall risk scores of hearing aids embedded with inertial measurement units (IMU-HAs) and powered by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms with scores by trained observers.\nProspective, double-blinded, observational study of fall risk scores between trained observers and those of IMU-HAs.\nTertiary referral center.\nTwo hundred fifty participants aged 55-100 years who were at risk for falls.\nFall risk was categorized using the Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) test battery consisting of the 4-Stage Balance, Timed Up and Go (TUG), and 30-Second Chair Stand tests. Performance was scored using bilateral IMU-HAs and compared to scores by clinicians blinded to the hearing aid measures.\nFall risk categorizations based on 4-Stage Balance, Timed Up and Go (TUG), and 30-Second Chair Stand tests obtained from IMU-HAs and clinicians.\nInterrater reliability was excellent across all clinicians. The 4-Stage Balance and TUG showed no statistically significant differences between clinician and HAs. However, the IMU-HAs failed to record a response in 12% of TUG trials. For the 30-Second Chair Stand test, there was a significant difference of nearly one stand count, which would have altered fall risk classification in 21% of participants.\nThese results suggest that fall risk as determined by the STEADI tests was in most instances similar for IMU-HAs and trained observers; however, differences were observed in certain situations, suggesting improvements are needed in the algorithm to maximize accurate fall risk categorization.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the transfer of more than one embryo has become less frequent to diminish multiple pregnancies. Even so, there is still a risk of one embryo splitting into two or even three. This report presents the case of a triamniotic monochorionic gestation in a 35-year-old woman, obtained after the transfer of a single day 5 embryo that had been previously hatched with a laser and subsequently transferred in a fresh IVF cycle. The morphokinetics of this embryo as well as another eight that produced monozygotic twins were compared with nine embryos that achieved singleton gestations. An artificial intelligence (AI) system was used to perform this analysis objectively. Embryo divisions leading to multiple gestations were slower across all analysed parameters. This was most evident in the time taken to reach the 5-cell stage (t5) (48.74\u2009\u00b1\u20093.21 versus 44.69\u2009\u00b1\u20095.61\u2009h) and the morula stage (tM) (85.08\u2009\u00b1\u200910.00 versus 78.13\u2009\u00b1\u20095.35\u2009h). Moreover, blastocyst diameter (161.80\u2009\u00b1\u200926.50 versus 179.10\u2009\u00b1\u200925.88\u2009\u03bcm) and area (21\u00a0684\u2009\u00b1\u20097267.4 versus 26\u00a0516\u2009\u00b1\u20097254.8 \u03bcm2) were smaller in these embryos, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. This is the first report, to our knowledge, to use AI to analyse and compare morphokinetic parameters between singleton pregnancies and a group of embryos that produced twin and triplet pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive gastric cancer (GC) shows a robust response to the combined therapy based HER2-targeted therapy. The application of these therapies is highly dependent on the evaluation of tumor HER2 status. However, there are many risks and challenges in HER2 assessment in GC. Therefore, an economically viable and readily available instrument is requisite for distinguishing HER2 status among patients diagnosed with GC. The study has innovatively developed a deep learning model, HER2Net, which can predict the HER2 status by quantitatively calculating the proportion of HER2 high-expression regions. The HER2Net is trained on an internal training set derived from 531 hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) whole slide images (WSI) of 520 patients. Subsequently, the performance of HER2Net is validated on an internal test set from 115 H&E WSI of 111 patients and an external multi-center test set from 102 H&E WSI of 101 patients. The HER2Net achieves an accuracy of 0.9043 on the internal test set, and an accuracy of 0.8922 on an external test set from multiple institutes. This discovery indicates that the HER2Net can potentially offer a novel methodology for the identification of HER2-positive GC.",

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models are a new technological development with vast research use cases among medical subspecialties. These powerful large language models offer a wide range of possibilities in wound care, from personalized patient support to optimized treatment plans and improved scientific writing. They can also assist in efficiently navigating the literature and selecting and summarizing articles, enabling researchers to focus on impactful studies relevant to wound care management and enhancing response quality through prompt-learning iterations. For nonnative English-speaking medical practitioners and authors, generative AI may aid in grammar and vocabulary selection. Although reports have suggested limitations of the conversational agent on medical translation pertaining to the precise interpretation of medical context, when used with verified resources, this language model can breach language barriers and promote practice-changing advancements in global wound care. Further, AI-powered chatbots can enable continuous monitoring of wound healing progress and real-time insights into treatment responses through frequent, readily available remote patient follow-ups.However, implementing AI in wound care research requires careful consideration of potential limitations, especially in accurately translating complex medical terms and workflows. Ethical considerations are vital to ensure reliable and credible wound care research when using AI technologies. Although ChatGPT shows promise for transforming wound care management, the authors warn against overreliance on the technology. Considering the potential limitations and risks, proper validation and oversight are essential to unlock its true potential while ensuring patient safety and the effectiveness of wound care treatments.",

    "abstract": "Determining spectacle-corrected visual acuity (VA) is essential when managing many ophthalmic diseases. If artificial intelligence (AI) evaluations of macular images estimated this VA from a fundus image, AI might provide spectacle-corrected VA without technician costs, reduce visit time, or facilitate home monitoring of VA from fundus images obtained outside of the clinic.\nTo estimate spectacle-corrected VA measured on a standard eye chart among patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) in clinical practice settings using previously validated AI algorithms evaluating best-corrected VA from fundus photographs in eyes with DME.\nRetrospective cross-sectional evaluation of deidentified fundus photographs matched to spectacle-corrected VA determined by technicians on eye charts among patients with a history of DME based on optical coherence tomography and at least 2 visits within 1 to 6 months of each other at a university-based clinic between January 2014 and December 2022. Data were analyzed from January 2023 to October 2024.\nPreviously validated AI algorithm evaluation of fundus photographs.\nAI-determined VA mean absolute error (MAE) compared with actual spectacle-corrected VA.\nAmong 141 patients, the mean (SD) age was 63 (13) years, 71 (50%) were male, 2 (1%) were Asian, 42 (30%) were Black or African American, and 88 (63%) were White. Among 282 eyes at visit 1, 66 had nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and DME, 38 had proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and DME, 101 had NPDR and no DME, and 77 had PDR and no DME. Among 564 images (282 eyes) at both initial and follow-up visits, MAE (SD) among eyes with NPDR, with or without center-involved DME (CI-DME), was 1.16 (1.00) lines on the eye chart for VA between 20/10 and 20/20 (67 images), and 1.44 (1.15) lines for between VA 20/25 and 20/80 (231 images). MAE (SD) among eyes with PDR, with or without CI-DME, was 1.92 (1.08) lines for VA between 20/10 and 20/20 (50 images), and 1.42 (0.97) lines for spectacle-corrected VA between 20/25 and 20/80 (150 images). Only 65 images had VA 20/100 or worse, precluding meaningful analyses.\nIn this cross-sectional study, AI evaluation of fundus photographs among patients with DME and VA 20/80 or better estimated spectacle-corrected VA within approximately 1 to 1.5 lines of actual spectacle-corrected VA. These results support use of AI evaluation of fundus photographs to determine spectacle-corrected VA among patients with DME globally, beyond ophthalmology offices.",

    "abstract": "Screening diabetic retinopathy (DR) for timely management can reduce global blindness. Many existing DR screening programs worldwide are non-digital, standalone, and deployed with grading retinal photographs by trained personnel. To integrate the screening programs, with or without artificial intelligence (AI), into hospital information systems to improve their effectiveness, the non-digital workflow must be transformed into digital. We developed a cloud-based digital platform and implemented it in an existing DR screening program.\nWe conducted the following processes in the platform for prospective DR screening at a community hospital: capturing patients' retinal photographs, uploading them for grading by AI or trained personnel on alternate weeks for 32\u00a0weeks, and referring vision-threatening DR to a referral center. At this center, the platform was applied for the assessment of potential missed referrals via remote over-reading by a retinal specialist and tracking referrals. Implementational outcomes, such as detecting positive cases, agreement between AI and over-reading, and referral adherence were assessed.\nOf 645 patients screened by AI, 201 (31.2%) were referrals, 129 (64.2%) of which were true positives agreeable by over-reading; 115 of these true positives (89.1%) had referral adherence. False negatives judged by over-reading were 1.1% (5/444). Of 730 patients in manual screening, 175 (24.0%) were potential referrals, 11 (6.3%) of which were referred at the point-of-screening; eight of these (72.7%) adhered to referral. The remaining 164 cases were appointed for later examination by a visiting general ophthalmologist; 11 of these 116 examined (9.5%) were referred for non-DR-related eye conditions with 81.8% (9/11) referral adherence. No system failure or interruption was found.\nThe digital platform can be practically integrated into the existing non-digital DR screening programs to implement AI and monitor previously unknown but important indicators, such as referral adherence, to improve the effectiveness of the programs.\nClinicalTrials.gov.

    "abstract": "This narrative review examines the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in organ retrieval and transplantation. AI and ML technologies enhance donor-recipient matching by integrating and analyzing complex datasets encompassing clinical, genetic, and demographic information, leading to more precise organ allocation and improved transplant success rates. In surgical planning, AI-driven image analysis automates organ segmentation, identifies critical anatomical features, and predicts surgical outcomes, aiding pre-operative planning and reducing intraoperative risks. Predictive analytics further enable personalized treatment plans by forecasting organ rejection, infection risks, and patient recovery trajectories, thereby supporting early intervention strategies and long-term patient management. AI also optimizes operational efficiency within transplant centers by predicting organ demand, scheduling surgeries efficiently, and managing inventory to minimize wastage, thus streamlining workflows and enhancing resource allocation. Despite these advancements, several challenges hinder the widespread adoption of AI and ML in organ transplantation. These include data privacy concerns, regulatory compliance issues, interoperability across healthcare systems, and the need for rigorous clinical validation of AI models. Addressing these challenges is essential to ensuring the reliable, safe, and ethical use of AI in clinical settings. Future directions for AI and ML in transplantation medicine include integrating genomic data for precision immunosuppression, advancing robotic surgery for minimally invasive procedures, and developing AI-driven remote monitoring systems for continuous post-transplantation care. Collaborative efforts among clinicians, researchers, and policymakers are crucial to harnessing the full potential of AI and ML, ultimately transforming transplantation medicine and improving patient outcomes while enhancing healthcare delivery efficiency.",

    "abstract": "High levels of emotional intelligence (EI) and resilience in primary care physicians (PCPs) can help them communicate better with patients, build stronger relationships with colleagues, and foster a positive and collaborative workplace. However, studies have indicated that primary care physicians (PCPs) often do not focus enough on developing these skills. Consequently, the purpose of this mixed methods study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an experiential online training (EOT) intervention in enhancing the EI and resilience of PCPs who treat patients with chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs).\nA total of 46 PCPs from Greece participated in a 25-hour EOT program, which focused on counseling skills for lifestyle change and breathing techniques for self-regulation. Quantitative data were collected using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form (TEIQue-SF) and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-25) before, immediately after, and three months post-intervention. Additionally, qualitative data were obtained through written reflections from participants regarding their clinical practice.\nThe results revealed significant improvements in EI and resilience scores immediately after the intervention (\u0395\u0399: 5.13, SD: 0.65 vs. 5.3, SD: 0.57, ",

    "abstract": "To create a computer-aided prediction (CAP) system to predict Wilms tumor (WT) responsiveness to preoperative chemotherapy (PC) using pre-therapy contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT).\nA single-center database was reviewed for children <18 years diagnosed with WT and received PC between 2001 and 2021. Patients were excluded if pre- and post-PC CECT were not retrievable. According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, volumetric response was considered favorable if PC resulted in \u226530% tumor volume reduction. Histological response was considered favorable if post-nephrectomy specimens had \u226566% necrosis. Four steps were used to create the prediction model: tumor delineation; extraction of shape, texture and functionality-based features; integration of the extracted features and selection of the prediction model with the highest diagnostic performance. K-fold cross-validation allowed the presentation of all data in the training and testing phases.\nA total of 63 tumors in 54 patients were used to train and test the prediction model. Patients were treated with 4-8 weeks of vincristine/actinomycin-D combination. Favorable volumetric and histologic responses were achieved in 46 tumors (73.0%) and 38 tumors (60.3%), respectively. Among machine learning classifiers, support vector machine had the best diagnostic performance with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95.24%, 95.65%, and 94.12% for volumetric and 84.13%, 89.47%, 88% for histologic response prediction.\nBased on pre-therapy CECT, CAP systems can help identify WT that are less likely to respond to PC with excellent accuracy. These tumors can be offered upfront surgery, avoiding the cons of PC.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enhance the differentiation of cystic lesions in the sellar region, such as pituitary adenomas, Rathke cleft cysts (RCCs) and craniopharyngiomas (CP), through the use of advanced neuroimaging techniques, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The goal is to explore how AI-driven models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep learning, and ensemble methods, can overcome the limitations of traditional diagnostic approaches, providing more accurate and early differentiation of these lesions. The review incorporates findings from critical studies, such as using the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset (Kaggle, San Francisco, USA)\u00a0for MRI-based brain research, highlighting the significance of statistical rigor and automated segmentation in developing reliable AI models. By drawing on these insights and addressing the challenges posed by small, single-institutional datasets, the paper aims to demonstrate how AI applications can improve diagnostic precision, enhance clinical decision-making, and ultimately lead to better patient outcomes in managing sellar region cystic lesions.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to be the world's greatest cause of death. To evaluate heart function and diagnose coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become essential. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been incorporated into diagnostic methods such as MPI to improve patient outcomes in recent years. This study aims to employ a novel approach to examine how parameters/criteria and performance metrics affect the prioritization of selected MPI techniques and AI tools in CAD diagnosis. Identifying the most effective method in these two interconnected areas will increase the CAD diagnosis rate.\nThe study includes an in-depth investigation of popular convolutional neural network (CNN) models, including InceptionV3, VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121, in addition to widely used machine learning (ML) models, including random forests (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and Na\u00efve Bayes (NB). In addition, it includes the evaluation of nuclear MPI techniques, including positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), with the non-nuclear MPI technique of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). Various performance metrics were used to evaluate AI tools. They are F1-score, recall, specificity, precision, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). For MPI techniques, the evaluation criteria include specificity, sensitivity, radiation dose, cost of scan, and study duration. The analysis was evaluated and compared using the fuzzy-based preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE), the multi-criteria decision-making method (MDCM).\nAccording to the study's findings, considering selected performance metrics or criteria, RF is the most efficient AI tool for SPECT MPI in the diagnosis of CAD with a net flow (\nIt was concluded that CMR outperformed the nuclear MPI techniques. SPECT, as the least advantageous technique, remained below average on other criteria except for the cost of the scan. Integrating the RF algorithm, which stands out as the most effective AI tool in diagnosing CAD, with SPECT MPI may contribute to SPECT becoming a superior alternative.",

    "abstract": "Due to considerable tumour heterogeneity, stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) has a poor prognosis and varies in response to treatment, making it one of the main causes of cancer-related mortality globally. Recent data point to a significant role for metabolic reprogramming, namely dysregulated lactic acid metabolism, in the evolution of STAD and treatment resistance. This study used a series of artificial intelligence-related approaches to identify IGFBP7, a Schlafen family member, as a critical factor in determining the response to immunotherapy and lactic acid metabolism in STAD patients. Computational analyses revealed that a high lactic metabolism (LM) state was associated with poor survival in STAD patients. Further biological network-based investigations identified a key subnetwork closely linked to LM. Machine learning techniques, such as random forest and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, highlighted IGFBP7 as a crucial indicator in STAD. Functional annotations showed that IGFBP7 expression was linked to important immune and inflammatory pathways. In\u00a0vitro experiments demonstrated that silencing IGFBP7 suppressed cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, heightened susceptibility to several chemotherapeutic drugs was linked to elevated IGFBP7 levels. In conclusion, this work sheds light on the mechanisms by which the lactate metabolism-related indicator IGFBP7 affects the tumour immune milieu and the response to immunotherapy in STAD. The results point to IGFBP7 as a possible therapeutic target and predictive biomarker for the treatment of STAD.",

    "abstract": "\"I see, I forget, I read aloud, I remember, and when I do read purposefully by writing it, I do not forget it.\" This phenomenon is known as \"interoception\" and refers to the sensing and interpretation of internal body signals, allowing the brain to communicate with various body systems. Dysfunction in interoception is associated with cardiovascular disorders. We delve into the concept of interoception and its impact on heart failure (HF) by reviewing and exploring neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive processing. Furthermore, we review the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosis, biomarker development, and HF treatment. In the context of HF, AI algorithms can analyze and interpret complex interoceptive data, providing valuable insights for diagnosis and treatment. These algorithms can identify patterns of disease markers that can contribute to early detection and diagnosis, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. These biomarkers hold significant potential in improving the precision/efficacy of HF. Additionally, AI-powered technologies offer promising avenues for treatment. By leveraging patient data, AI can personalize therapeutic interventions. AI-driven technologies such as remote monitoring devices and wearable sensors enable the monitoring of patients' health. By harnessing the power of AI, we should aim to advance the diagnosis and treatment strategies for HF. This review explores the potential of AI in diagnosing, developing biomarkers, and managing HF.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance refers to the ability of pathogens to develop resistance to drugs designed to eliminate them, making the infections they cause more difficult to treat and increasing the likelihood of disease diffusion and mortality. As such, antimicrobial resistance is considered as one of the most significant and universal challenges to both health and society, as well as the environment. In our research, we employ the explainable artificial intelligence paradigm to identify the factors that most affect the onset of antimicrobial resistance in diversified territorial contexts, which can vary widely from each other in terms of climatic, economic and social conditions. Specifically, we employ a large set of indicators identified through the One Health framework to predict, at the country level, mortality resulting from antimicrobial resistance related to Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The analysis reveals the outstanding importance of indicators related to water accessibility and quality in determining mortality due to antimicrobial resistance to the considered pathogens across countries, providing perspective as a potential tool for decision support and monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Humanity faces many health challenges, among which respiratory diseases are one of the leading causes of human death. Existing AI-driven pre-diagnosis approaches can enhance the efficiency of diagnosis but still face challenges. For example, single-modal data suffer from information redundancy or loss, difficulty in learning relationships between features, and revealing the obscure characteristics of complex diseases. Therefore, it is critical to explore a method that can assist clinicians in detecting lesions early and in pre-diagnosing corresponding diseases.\nThis paper introduces a novel network structure, SCSCS-Net, which can effectively extract image features from chest X-ray images and generate medical image descriptions, assist clinicians in analyzing patients' medical imaging information, deeply explore potential disease characteristics, and assist in making pre-diagnostic decisions. The SCSCS-Net consists of a reinforced cross-modal feature representation model (RCMFR) and a self-critical cross-modal alignment model (SCCMA), which are responsible for learning the features interdependence between images and reports by using a multi-subspace self-attention structure and guiding the model in learning report generation strategies to improve the professionalism and consistency of medical terms in generated reports, respectively.\nWe further compare our model with some advanced models on the same dataset, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance. Finally, the CE and NLG metrics further confirm that the proposed method acquires the ability to generate high-quality medical reports with higher clinical consistency in generating medical reports.\nOur novel method has the potential to improve the early detection and pre-diagnosis of respiratory diseases. The model proposed in this paper allows to narrow the gap between Artificial intelligence technology and clinical medical diagnosis and provides the possibility for in-depth integration.",

    "abstract": "With the use of machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a viable diagnostic and treatment tool for oral cancer. AI can assess a variety of information, including histopathology slides and intraoral pictures.\nThe purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and accuracy of AI technology in the detection and diagnosis of oral cancer between 2020 and 2024.\nWith an emphasis on AI applications in oral cancer diagnostics, a thorough search approach was used to find pertinent publications published between 2020 and 2024. Using particular keywords associated with AI, oral cancer, and diagnostic imaging, databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched. Among the selection criteria were actual English-language research papers that assessed the effectiveness of AI models in diagnosing oral cancer. Three impartial reviewers extracted data, evaluated quality, and compiled the findings using a narrative synthesis technique.\nTwelve papers that demonstrated a range of AI applications in the diagnosis of oral cancer satisfied the inclusion criteria. This study showed encouraging results in lesion identification and prognostic prediction using machine learning and deep learning algorithms to evaluate oral pictures and histopathology slides. The results demonstrated how AI-driven technologies might enhance diagnostic precision and enable early intervention in cases of oral cancer.\nUnprecedented prospects to transform oral cancer diagnosis and detection are provided by artificial intelligence. More resilient AI systems in oral oncology can be achieved by joint research and innovation efforts, even in the face of constraints like data set variability and regulatory concerns.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a contribution in recent years to the development of new tools for dental, surgical, and esthetic treatment. In the case of image diagnosis, AI allows automated analysis of some facial parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the precision and reproducibility of these IA analyses compared with a human operator.\nThirty subjects were selected, and frontal and profile photographs were taken of each. The photographs were previously calibrated and then analyzed by a human operator and an AI for vertical, horizontal, symmetry parameters, and facial profile angles.\nStatistically significant differences were found in at least 1 vertical, horizontal, symmetry, and facial profile measurement.\nThe 2D facial analysis performed on photographs using AI is an interesting and constantly evolving tool. However, there are still many differences with the analysis performed by the human operator, so it should be used carefully. Further studies using metric measurements should be performed to contrast the values obtained by human operators and AI and to analyze the accuracy of point selection in facial soft tissues.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing the speed and efficiency of clinical trial recruitment is a key objective across international health systems. This study aimed to use artificial intelligence (AI) applied in the Victorian Cancer Registry (VCR), a population-based cancer registry, to assess (1) if VCR received all relevant pathology reports for three clinical trials, (2) AI accuracy in auto-extracting information from pathology reports for recruitment, and (3) the number of participants approached for trial enrollment using the AI approach compared with standard hospital-based recruitment.\nTo verify pathology report accessibility for VCR trial enrollment, reports from the laboratory were cross-referenced. To determine the accuracy of a Rapid Case Ascertainment (RCA) module of the AI software in extracting key clinical variables from the pathology report, data were compared with manually reviewed reports. To examine the effectiveness of the AI recruitment approach, the number of patients approached for recruitment was compared with standard practice.\nOf the 195 reports provided by the pathology laboratory, 185 (94.9%) were received by VCR, 73 of 195 (37.4%) were eligible for the studies, and 5 of 73 (6.8%) eligible cases had not been received by the VCR. The RCA module demonstrated an accuracy of 93% and an F1 score of 0.94 in extracting key clinical variables. However, the RCA false-positive rate was 10% and the false-negative rate was 5%. The standard hospital approach selected fewer cases for approach to clinical trials compared with the RCA module approach, 8 of 336 (2.4%) versus 12 of 336 (3.6%), respectively.\nUsing AI to screen potentially eligible cases for recruitment to three clinical trials resulted in a 50% increase in eligible cases being approached for enrollment.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we draw on social identity and social exchange theory to propose pathways via which emotional intelligence directed toward others in the organization has an impact on employee effectiveness. Findings from 122 supervisor-employee dyads showed that employees' other-oriented emotional intelligence is related to their organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) via the mechanisms of building high-quality exchanges with one's leaders and coworkers. We theorize and find evidence for unique mechanisms involved in mediating the effects of other-oriented emotional intelligence on taking charge and helping. Furthermore, both helping others and taking charge influenced performance ratings. We discuss theoretical and practical implications as well as limitations and areas for future research.",

    "abstract": "Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a 175-billion-parameter natural language processing model that uses deep learning algorithms trained on vast amounts of data to generate human-like texts such as essays. Consequently, it has introduced new challenges and threats to medical education. We assessed the use of ChatGPT and other AI tools among medical students in Uganda.\nWe conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study among medical students at four public universities in Uganda from 1st November 2023 to 20th December 2023. Participants were recruited by stratified random sampling. We used a semi-structured questionnaire to collect data on participants' socio-demographics and use of AI tools such as ChatGPT. Our outcome variable was use of AI tools. Data were analyzed descriptively in Stata version 17.0. We conducted a modified Poisson regression to explore the association between use of AI tools and various exposures.\nA total of 564 students participated. Almost all (93%) had heard about AI tools and more than two-thirds (75.7%) had ever used AI tools. Regarding the AI tools used, majority (72.2%) had ever used ChatGPT, followed by SnapChat AI (14.9%), Bing AI (11.5%), and Bard AI (6.9%). Most students use AI tools to complete assignments (55.5%), preparing for tutorials (39.9%), preparing for exams (34.8%) and research writing (24.8%). Students also reported the use of AI tools for nonacademic purposes including emotional support, recreation, and spiritual growth. Older students were 31% less likely to use AI tools compared to younger ones (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio (aPR):0.69; 95% CI: [0.62, 0.76]). Students at Makerere University were 66% more likely to use AI tools compared to students in Gulu University (aPR:1.66; 95% CI:[1.64, 1.69]).\nThe use of ChatGPT and other AI tools was widespread among medical students in Uganda. AI tools were used for both academic and non-academic purposes. Younger students were more likely to use AI tools compared to older students. There is a need to promote AI literacy in institutions to empower older students with essential skills for the digital age. Further, educators should assume students are using AI and adjust their way of teaching and setting exams to suit this new reality. Our research adds further evidence to existing voices calling for regulatory frameworks for AI in medical education.",

This AMEE Guide aims to assist all HPE stakeholders by helping them navigate the assessment uncertainty before them. Although the impetus is AI, the Guide grounds its path in pedagogical theory, considers the range of human responses, and then deals with assessment types, challenges, AI roles as tutor and learner, and required competencies. It then discusses the difficult and ethical issues, before ending with considerations for faculty development and the technicalities of AI acknowledgment in assessment. Through this Guide, we aim to allay fears in the face of change and demonstrate possibilities that will allow educators and learners to harness the full potential of AI in HPE assessment.",

    "abstract": "Traditional computer-assisted detection (CADe) algorithms were developed for 2D mammography, while modern artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can be applied to 2D mammography and/or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). The objective is to compare the performance of a traditional machine learning CADe algorithm for synthetic 2D mammography to a deep learning-based AI algorithm for DBT on the same mammograms.\nMammographic examinations from 764 patients (mean age 58\u00a0years \u00b1 11) with 106 biopsy-proven cancers and 658 cancer-negative cases were analyzed by a CADe algorithm (ImageChecker v10.0, Hologic, Inc.) and an AI algorithm (Genius AI Detection v2.0, Hologic, Inc.). Synthetic 2D images were used for CADe analysis, and DBT images were used for AI analysis. For each algorithm, an overall case score was defined as the highest score of all lesion marks, which was used to determine the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\nThe overall AUC was higher for 3D AI than 2D CADe (0.873 versus 0.693, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Lesion-specific sensitivity of 3D AI was higher than 2D CADe (94.3 versus 72.6%, P\u2009=\u20090.002). Specificity of 3D AI was higher than 2D CADe (54.3 versus 16.7%, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and the rate of false marks on non-cancer cases was lower for 3D AI than 2D CADe (0.91 versus 3.24 per exam, P\u2009<\u20090.001).\nA deep learning-based AI algorithm applied to DBT images significantly outperformed a traditional machine learning CADe algorithm applied to synthetic 2D mammographic images, with regard to AUC, sensitivity, and specificity.",

AI models have demonstrated superior performance in distinguishing healthy individuals from those at risk of congestive HF by analyzing heart rate variability data. In addition, AI clinical decision support systems exhibit high concordance rates with HF experts, enhancing diagnostic precision. For HF with reduced as well as preserved ejection fraction, AI-powered algorithms help detect subtle irregularities in electrocardiograms and other related predictors. AI also aids in predicting HF risk in diabetic patients, using complex data patterns to enhance understanding and management. Moreover, AI technologies help forecast HF-related hospital admissions, enabling timely interventions to reduce readmission rates and improve patient outcomes. Continued innovation and research are crucial to address challenges related to data privacy and ethical considerations and ensure responsible implementation in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "The food flavor science, traditionally reliant on experimental methods, is now entering a promising era with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). By integrating existing technologies with AI, researchers can explore and develop new flavor substances in a digital environment, saving time and resources. More and more research will use AI and big data to enhance product flavor, improve product quality, meet consumer needs, and drive the industry toward a smarter and more sustainable future. In this review, we elaborate on the mechanisms of flavor recognition and their potential impact on nutritional regulation. With the increase of data accumulation and the development of internet information technology, food flavor databases and food ingredient databases have made great progress. These databases provide detailed information on the nutritional content, flavor molecules, and chemical properties of various food compounds, providing valuable data support for the rapid evaluation of flavor components and the construction of screening technology. With the popularization of AI in various fields, the field of food flavor has also ushered in new development opportunities. This review explores the mechanisms of flavor recognition and the role of AI in enhancing food flavor analysis through high-throughput omics data and screening technologies. AI algorithms offer a pathway to scientifically improve product formulations, thereby enhancing flavor and customized meals. Furthermore, it discusses the safety challenges of integrating AI into the food flavor industry.",

    "abstract": "Mental disorders are a critical global public health problem due to their increasing prevalence, rising costs, and significant economic burden. Despite efforts to increase the mental health workforce in T\u00fcrkiye, there is a significant shortage of psychiatrists, limiting the quality and accessibility of mental health services. This review examines the potential of artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models, to transform psychiatric care in the world and in T\u00fcrkiye. AI technologies, including machine learning and deep learning, offer innovative solutions for the diagnosis, personalization of treatment, and monitoring of mental disorders using a variety of data sources, such as speech patterns, neuroimaging, and behavioral measures. Although AI has shown promising capabilities in improving diagnostic accuracy and access to mental health services, challenges such as algorithmic biases, data privacy concerns, ethical implications, and the confabulation phenomenon of large language models prevent the full implementation of AI in practice. The review highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to develop culturally and linguistically adapted AI tools, particularly in the Turkish context, and suggests strategies such as fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation, and reinforcement learning from human feedback to increase AI reliability. Advances suggest that AI can improve mental health care by increasing diagnostic accuracy and accessibility while preserving the essential human elements of medical care. Current limitations need to be addressed through rigorous research and ethical frameworks for effective and equitable integration of AI into mental health care.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the deadliest malignant tumor, with a grim 5-year overall survival rate of about 12%. As its incidence and mortality rates rise, it is likely to become the second-leading cause of cancer-related death. The radiological assessment determined the stage and management of PDAC. However, it is a highly heterogeneous disease with the complexity of the tumor microenvironment, and it is challenging to adequately reflect the biological aggressiveness and prognosis accurately through morphological evaluation alone. With the dramatic development of artificial intelligence (AI), multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) using specific contrast media and special techniques can provide morphological and functional information with high image quality and become a powerful tool in quantifying intratumor characteristics. Besides, AI has been widespread in the field of medical imaging analysis. Radiomics is the high-throughput mining of quantitative image features from medical imaging that enables data to be extracted and applied for better decision support. Deep learning is a subset of artificial neural network algorithms that can automatically learn feature representations from data. AI-enabled imaging biomarkers of mpMRI have enormous promise to bridge the gap between medical imaging and personalized medicine and demonstrate huge advantages in predicting biological characteristics and the prognosis of PDAC. However, current AI-based models of PDAC operate mainly in the realm of a single modality with a relatively small sample size, and the technical reproducibility and biological interpretation present a barrage of new potential challenges. In the future, the integration of multi-omics data, such as radiomics and genomics, alongside the establishment of standardized analytical frameworks will provide opportunities to increase the robustness and interpretability of AI-enabled image biomarkers and bring these biomarkers closer to clinical practice.

    "abstract": "To evaluate the performance of Genki, a computer-aided detection (CADe) software, in detecting tuberculosis (TB) using chest radiography in a mobile TB screening program in Chennai, India.\nGenki, an AI-based CADe software, was employed in four mobile diagnostic units in remote areas of Chennai, India for screening TB. Patients from remote areas of Chennai who visited the vans and registered in the screening program underwent chest radiography, and the acquired X-ray scans were analyzed using Genki, which provided an assessment of each scan as either \"TB suggestive\" or \"TB not suggestive\". Subsequently, sputum or swab from the patients with \"TB suggestive\" results was collected to confirm the diagnosis.\nIn total, 25,598 patients were screened between January and December 2022. When the annotations from the expert radiologists were considered to be true, Genki demonstrated an aggregated sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 96.9%, and accuracy of 96.9% in detecting TB from chest X-ray scans of the screened population. Furthermore, it exhibited a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of >95%, >94%, and >94%, respectively, for both sexes (male and female) and all age groups (14-35, 36-60, and \u226561 years).\nGenki demonstrated excellent value as a TB screening tool in remote locations in Chennai, India.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative illnesses place a heavy strain on the world's healthcare systems, particularly among the aging population. With a focus on research from January 2022 to September 2023, this scoping review, which adheres to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-Scr) criteria, examines the changing landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) applications for early AD detection and diagnosis. Forty-four carefully chosen articles were selected from a pool of 2,966 articles for the qualitative synthesis. The research reveals impressive advancements in AI-driven approaches, including neuroimaging, genomics, cognitive tests, and blood-based biomarkers. Notably, AI models focusing on deep learning (DL) algorithms demonstrate outstanding accuracy in early AD identification, often even before the onset of clinical symptoms. Multimodal approaches, which combine information from various sources, including neuroimaging and clinical assessments, provide comprehensive insights into the complex nature of AD. The study also emphasizes the critical role that blood-based and genetic biomarkers play in strengthening AD diagnosis and risk assessment. When combined with clinical or imaging data, genetic variations and polygenic risk scores help to improve prediction models. In a similar vein, blood-based biomarkers provide non-invasive instruments for detecting metabolic changes linked to AD. Cognitive and functional evaluations, which include neuropsychological examinations and assessments of daily living activities, serve as essential benchmarks for monitoring the course of AD and directing treatment interventions. When these evaluations are included in machine learning models, the diagnosis accuracy is improved, and treatment monitoring is made more accessible. In addition, including methods that support model interpretability and explainability helps in the thorough understanding and valuable implementation of AI-driven insights in clinical contexts. This review further identifies several gaps in the research landscape, including the need for diverse, high-quality datasets to address data heterogeneity and improve model generalizability. Practical implementation challenges, such as integrating AI systems into clinical workflows and clinician adoption, are highlighted as critical barriers to real-world application. Moreover, ethical considerations, particularly surrounding data privacy and informed consent, must be prioritized as AI adoption in healthcare accelerates. Performance metrics (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC)) for AI-based approaches are discussed, with a need for clearer reporting and comparative analyses. Addressing these limitations, alongside methodological clarity and critical evaluation of biases, would strengthen the credibility of AI applications in AD detection. By expanding its scope, this study highlights areas for improvement and future opportunities in early detection, aiming to bridge the gap between innovative AI technologies and practical clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare globally by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, predicting patient outcomes, and enabling personalized treatment plans. However, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Pakistan, the integration of AI into healthcare is limited due to challenges such as lack of funding, provider resistance, and inadequate training. Despite these barriers, there is growing interest among healthcare providers in understanding and adopting AI technologies to improve professional efficiency. Objective To determine knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) regarding the use of artificial intelligence (AI) among doctors in a hospital setting. Method This cross-sectional study was conducted at Mardan Medical Complex, Mardan, from January 2023 to March 2023. A total of 150 doctors from various departments participated by completing a validated questionnaire designed to assess their KAP regarding AI. The questionnaire, consisting of nine close-ended questions, was specifically designed and distributed to participants through social media applications, including WhatsApp (California, USA) and email, to maximize accessibility. It included structured questions rated on Likert scales to quantify the levels of knowledge, attitude, and practice. Participants were also asked about their exposure to AI-related training or professional work. Descriptive analysis was performed to determine the frequency and percentage of responses. Results The mean \u00b1 SD of age in this study was 36.95 \u00b1 8.58 years. Male participants were 72.66%, while 27.33% were females. The response to the questions showed that the majority of participants (66%) knew the term AI; however, they were unsure regarding its use in healthcare. The majority of doctors (67.33%) had positive thoughts about the possibility of using AI in health management. Importantly, the majority of participants (72.66%) had never had a chance to do any AI-related work in their professional lives. The assessment of KAP showed that the majority of doctors had a medium level of knowledge (36.66%), a high level of attitude (57.55%), and a low level of practice (65.66%) regarding AI. Conclusions These results conclude that the knowledge regarding AI's use in healthcare is medium and its use in clinical practice is low; however, doctors have a high level of interest in applying AI to improve their professional efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of shoulder range of motion (ROM) is crucial for evaluating patient progress. Traditional manual goniometry often lacks precision and is subject to inter-observer variability, especially in measuring shoulder internal rotation (IR). This study introduces an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach that uses clinical photography to improve the accuracy of ROM quantification. We analyzed a total of 150 clinical photographs, including 100 shoulder and 50 elbow images, taken between January and April 2022. An MMPose model with an HR-NET backbone architecture, pre-trained on the COCO-WholeBody dataset, was used to detect 17 anatomical landmarks. A random forest classifier (PoseRF) then categorized poses, and ROM angles were calculated. Concurrently, two clinicians independently measured shoulder IR at the vertebral level, and inter-observer agreement was evaluated. Linear regression analyses were conducted to correlate the AI-derived measurements with the clinicians' assessments. The AI-based algorithm accurately detected anatomical landmarks in 96% of shoulder and 100% of elbow images. Pose detection achieved 95% accuracy overall, with 100% accuracy for specific shoulder (abduction, flexion, external rotation) and elbow (flexion, extension) poses. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between the AI algorithm and human observers ranged from 0.965 to 0.997, indicating excellent inter-observer reliability. Kruskal-Wallis test showed no statistically significant differences in ROM measurements among the AI algorithm and two human observers across all joint angles (\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13534-024-00432-w.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we work with information across disciplines and practical contexts. A growing range of disciplines are now involved in studying, developing and assessing the use of AI in practice, but these disciplines often employ conflicting understandings of what AI is and what is involved in its use. New, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to bridge competing conceptualizations of AI in practice and help shape the future of AI use. I propose a novel conceptual framework called AI Thinking, which models key decisions and considerations involved in AI use across disciplinary perspectives. AI Thinking addresses five practice-based competencies involved in applying AI in context: motivating AI use, formulating AI methods, assessing available tools and technologies, selecting appropriate data and situating AI in the sociotechnical contexts it is used in. A hypothetical case study is provided to illustrate the application of AI Thinking in practice. This article situates AI Thinking in broader cross-disciplinary discourses of AI, including its connections to ongoing discussions around AI literacy and AI-driven innovation. AI Thinking can help to bridge between the work of diverse disciplines, contexts and actors in the AI space, and shape AI efforts in education, industrial development and policy.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence technology rapidly advances, its deployment within the medical sector presents substantial ethical challenges. Consequently, it becomes crucial to create a standardized, transparent, and secure framework for processing medical data. This includes setting the ethical boundaries for medical artificial intelligence and safeguarding both patient rights and data integrity. This consensus governs every facet of medical data handling through artificial intelligence, encompassing data gathering, processing, storage, transmission, utilization, and sharing. Its purpose is to ensure the management of medical data adheres to ethical standards and legal requirements, while safeguarding patient privacy and data security. Concurrently, the principles of compliance with the law, patient privacy respect, patient interest protection, and safety and reliability are underscored. Key issues such as informed consent, data usage, intellectual property protection, conflict of interest, and benefit sharing are examined in depth. The enactment of this expert consensus is intended to foster the profound integration and sustainable advancement of artificial intelligence within the medical domain, while simultaneously ensuring that artificial intelligence adheres strictly to the relevant ethical norms and legal frameworks during the processing of medical data.",

The 2023 Executive Order, Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, requires an assessment of how AI can increase biorisk. Within this perspective, quantitative and qualitative frameworks for evaluating biorisk are presented. Both frameworks are exercised using notional scenarios and their benefits and limitations are then discussed. Finally, the perspective concludes by noting that assessment and evaluation methodologies must keep pace with advances of AI in the life\u00a0sciences.",

While there are structures institutionalized to promote students' well-being, universities are faced with a myriad of challenges which can negatively impact mental health and disrupt the overall learning experiences of students. This study explored the relationship between Emotional Intelligence and Self-Esteem which have been found to influence the mental health of students.\nInformed by the cross-sectional design, one thousand and twenty (N\u2009=\u20091020) university students were recruited to self-report their Emotional Intelligence and Self-Esteem. The participants completed the Schutte Emotional Intelligence scale and the Rosenberg's Self-Esteem scale. The data were validated using confirmatory factor analysis, means were computed, followed by multivariate analysis of variance and hierarchical multiple regression.\nThe study showed that participants were ambivalent on both EI and self-esteem. The hypothesized relationship between Emotional Intelligence and Self-Esteem was supported by the study findings. More so, demographic variables such as gender, religion and programme of study provided further insight into Emotional Intelligence and Self-Esteem of participants.\nIn conclusion, the researchers of this study called on educators and university administrators to prioritize the Emotional Intelligence and Self-Esteem of students in mental health interventions. The need for partnership between administrators and religious leaders and other study implications, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the mediating role of social intelligence in the effect of nurses' work-related strain on trait anger and anger expressions. The challenging working conditions for nurses often result in increased strain and anger. Social intelligence could help to manage anger.\nThis cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted with 446 nurses at a public hospital in T\u00fcrkiye between April and May, 2021. The questionnaire consisted of socio demographics, Trait Anger and Anger Expression Inventory, Tromso Social Intelligent Scale, and Work-Related Strain Inventory. The data was collected face to face. Descriptive statistics and Pearson's correlation coefficient were conducted using SPSS (v.26) and mediation analysis was conducted using PROCESS macro (Hayes, model 4).\nSocial intelligence played a mediating role in the effect of work-related strain on trait anger, anger-in, anger-out, and anger-control (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.105, \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.100, \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.131, \u03b2=-0.136, respectively). Social intelligence reduced the effect of work-related strain on trait anger and anger in/out expressions, while increasing anger control.\nThe findings of this study show that social intelligence could be used to manage anger of nurses. Nurse managers could implement initiatives aimed at managing nurses' anger and anger expressions through the decreasing of work-related strain and increasing of nurses' social intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of syphilis is vital for its effective control. This study aimed to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) diagnostic model based on radiomics technology to distinguish early syphilis from other clinical skin lesions.\nThe study collected 260 images of skin lesions caused by various skin infections, including 115 syphilis and 145 other infection types. 80% of the dataset was used for model development with 5-fold cross-validation, and the remaining 20% was used as a hold-out test set. The exact lesion region was manually segmented as Region of Interest (ROI) in each image with the help of two experts. 102 radiomics features were extracted from each ROI and fed into 11 different classifiers after deleting the redundant features using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Different image filters like Wavelet were investigated to improve the model performance. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used for evaluation, and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for model interpretation.\nAmong the 11 classifiers, the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) with the wavelet filter applied on the images demonstrated the best performance, offering the stratified 5-fold cross-validation AUC of 0.832\u2009\u00b1\u20090.042 and accuracy of 0.735\u2009\u00b1\u20090.043. On the hold-out test dataset, the model shows an AUC and accuracy of 0.792 and 0.750, respectively. The SHAP analysis shows that the shape 2D sphericity was the most predictive radiomics feature for distinguishing early syphilis from other skin infections.\nThe proposed AI diagnostic model, built based on radiomics features and machine learning classifiers, achieved an accuracy of 75.0%, and demonstrated potential in distinguishing early syphilis from other skin lesions.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that can result in a progressive loss of speech due to bulbar dysfunction, which can have significant negative impact on the patient's mental well-being. Alternative Augmentative Communication (AAC) strategies based on synthetic voices have been shown to assist patients in maintaining communication and improving their Quality of Life (QoL). However, such synthetic voices are often perceived as impersonal and fail to capture the unique voice and identity of the patient. To tackle this issue, combining voice banking (VB) and artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a more natural communication strategy, enabling individuals to preserve their voice for use with AAC devices as needed. This involves recording speech samples to generate a synthetic voice closely resembling the individual's own. Despite the increasing interest in VB, there's a lack of clear strategies for its effective implementation in rapidly progressing diseases like ALS. Additionally, the perceptual quality of VB on patients with preserved speech, especially when offered early in the disease, remains poorly understood. In light of these challenges, this study aims to assess the effectiveness and the perceptual impact of AI-generated voices on ALS patients with preserved speech, utilizing a personalized voice synthesis system based on machine learning. The AI-generated patient-specific voice is achieved through voice recording, followed by fine-tuning using a Generative Adversarial Network for Efficient and High Fidelity Speech Synthesis (HiFi-GAN), resulting in a model capable of producing speech highly similar to the patient's own voice, with exceptional expressive and audio quality. By addressing these aspects, this study intends to offer valuable insights into the potential benefits and challenges of combining VB with AI voices to enhance communication support for ALS patients.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate how deep learning and other artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can be used to enhance the intelligent level of dance instruction. The study develops a dance action recognition and feedback model based on the Graph Attention Mechanism (GA) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (3D-Resnet-BigRu). In this model, time series features are captured using BiGRU after 3D-ResNet is inserted to extract video features. Lastly, GA dynamically modifies the node weights to maximize action recognition performance. According to the experimental results, this model's F1 score is 85.34%, and its maximum accuracy on the NTU-RGBD60 datasets is more than 5% greater than that of the current 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) baseline algorithm. In addition, the model shows high efficiency and resource utilization in test time, training time and CPU occupancy. The research shows that this model has strong competitiveness in dealing with complex dance action recognition tasks, and provides efficient and personalized technical support for future dance teaching. Meanwhile, the model provides a powerful tool for dance educators to support their teaching activities and enhance students' learning experience.",

    "abstract": "Infertility affects one-in-six couples, often necessitating in vitro fertilization treatment (IVF). IVF generates complex data, which can challenge the utilization of the full richness of data during decision-making, leading to reliance on simple 'rules-of-thumb'. Machine learning techniques are well-suited to analyzing complex data to provide data-driven recommendations to improve decision-making. In this multi-center study (n =\u00a019,082 treatment-naive female patients), including 11 European IVF centers, we harnessed explainable artificial intelligence to identify follicle sizes that contribute most to relevant downstream clinical outcomes. We found that intermediately-sized follicles were most important to the number of mature oocytes subsequently retrieved. Maximizing this proportion of follicles by the end of ovarian stimulation was associated with improved live birth rates. Our data suggests that larger mean follicle sizes, especially those >18 mm, were associated with premature progesterone elevation by the end of ovarian stimulation and a negative impact on live birth rates with fresh embryo transfer. These data highlight the potential of computer technologies to aid in the personalization of IVF to optimize clinical outcomes pending future prospective validation.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies use a three-part strategy for facial visual enhancement: (1) Facial Detection, (2) Facial Landmark Detection, and (3) Filter Application (Chen in Arch Fac Plast Surg 21:361-367, 2019). In the context of the surgical patient population, open-source AI algorithms are capable of modifying or simulating images to present potential results of plastic surgery procedures. Our primary aim was to understand whether AI filter use may influence individuals' perceptions and expectations of post-surgical outcomes.\nWe utilized Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform and collected information on prior experience using AI-driven visual enhancement. The cohort was divided into two groups: AI-exposed and non-AI-exposed. Questions gauged confidence in plastic surgery's ability to meet participant expectations. A second survey exposed users to either AI-enhanced or to unenhanced pre-operative photographs. Then, unedited post-operative photographs were shown and surgery's ability to enhance appearance was assessed. A multivariable linear analysis was constructed to measure associations between exposure to AI enhancement and survey outcomes.\nA total of 426 responses were analysed: 66.9% with AI exposure and 33.1% with no prior exposure. Participants with previous experience using AI-driven enhancers had a significantly higher average score for expectations after plastic surgery (P\u2009<\u20090.001). This finding was true across all outcomes, including surgery's ability to relieve discomfort with appearance/self-esteem (P\u2009<\u20090.001), to avoid post-operative complications (P\u2009<\u20090.001), to decrease post-operative scarring (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and to improve overall appearance (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The image comparison survey revealed that post-operative images were viewed as more successful at improving appearance when no pre-operative filter was applied (P\u2009=\u20090.151).\nExposure to AI photograph enhancement may significantly raise expectations for plastic surgery outcomes and may predispose to having lower satisfaction after surgery. The significance of this study lies in its potential to reveal the extent to which AI technologies can shape patient understanding of their plastic surgery outcomes. Plastic surgeons aware of the effect of AI enhancement may consider using these results to guide counselling.\nhis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming rheumatology research, with a myriad of studies aiming to improve diagnosis, prognosis and treatment prediction, while also showing potential capability to optimise the research workflow, improve drug discovery and clinical trials. Machine learning, a key element of discriminative AI, has demonstrated the ability of accurately classifying rheumatic diseases and predicting therapeutic outcomes by using diverse data types, including structured databases, imaging and text. In parallel, generative AI, driven by large language models, is becoming a powerful tool for optimising the research workflow by supporting with content generation, literature review automation and clinical decision support. This review explores the current applications and future potential of both discriminative and generative AI in rheumatology. It also highlights the challenges posed by these technologies, such as ethical concerns and the need for rigorous validation and regulatory oversight. The integration of AI in rheumatology promises substantial advancements but requires a balanced approach to optimise benefits and minimise potential possible downsides.",

    "abstract": "Inaccurate prediction of lymph node metastasis (LNM) may lead to unnecessary surgery following endoscopic resection of T1 colorectal cancer (CRC). We aimed to validate the usefulness of artificial intelligence (AI) models for predicting LNM in patients with T1 CRC.\nWe analyzed the clinical data, laboratory results, pathological reports, and endoscopic findings of patients who underwent radical surgery for T1 CRC. We developed AI models to predict LNM using four algorithms: regularized logistic regression classifier (RLRC), random forest classifier (RFC), CatBoost classifier (CBC), and the voting classifier (VC). Four histological factors and four endoscopic findings were included to develop AI models. Areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROCs) were measured to distinguish AI model performance in accordance with the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum guidelines.\nAmong 1,386 patients with T1 CRC, 173 patients (12.5%) had LNM. The AUROC values of the RLRC, RFC, CBC, and VC models for LNM prediction were significantly higher (0.673, 0.640, 0.679, and 0.677, respectively) than the 0.525 suggested in accordance with the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum guidelines (vs RLRC, p<0.001; vs RFC, p=0.001; vs CBC, p<0.001; vs VC, p<0.001). The AUROC value was similar between T1 colon versus T1 rectal cancers (0.718 vs 0.615, p=0.700). The AUROC value was also similar between the initial endoscopic resection and initial surgery groups (0.581 vs 0.746, p=0.845).\nAI models trained on the basis of endoscopic findings and pathological features performed well in predicting LNM in patients with T1 CRC regardless of tumor location and initial treatment method.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to identify distinct trajectories of perceived stress and control in athletes across a season of sports competitions and whether these trajectory memberships could be predicted by subdimensions of the emotional intelligence (EI). Latent class growth analyses were performed on a five-stage longitudinal measurement plan (to cover the entire sporting season). Four hundred fifteen athletes answered to the Brief Emotional Intelligence Scale, the Mastery Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Attainment of Sport Achievement Goal Scale. The analyses revealed two trajectories of perceived stress (one trajectory adapted and one maladapted to performance) and two trajectories of perceived control (one trajectory adapted and one maladapted to performance). Moreover, athletes with higher emotional intelligence emotion regulation scores belong significantly more to performance-adaptive trajectories. The obtained results could contribute to the advancement of emotional intelligence intervention programs to optimize the dynamics of perceived stress and control within the sporting season.",

    "abstract": "Many members of Black American communities, faced with the high prevalence of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) within their demographic, find themselves taking on the role of informal caregivers. Despite being the primary individuals responsible for the care of individuals with ADRD, these caregivers often lack sufficient knowledge about ADRD-related health literacy and feel ill-prepared for their caregiving responsibilities. Generative AI has become a new promising technological innovation in the health care domain, particularly for improving health literacy; however, some generative AI developments might lead to increased bias and potential harm toward Black American communities. Therefore, rigorous development of generative AI tools to support the Black American community is needed.\nThe goal of this study is to test Lola, a multimodal mobile app, which, by relying on generative AI, facilitates access to ADRD-related health information by enabling speech and text as inputs and providing auditory, textual, and visual outputs.\nTo test our mobile app, we used the cognitive walk-through methodology, and we recruited 15 informal ADRD caregivers who were older than 50 years and part of the Black American community living within the region. We asked them to perform 3 tasks on the mobile app (ie, searching for an article on brain health, searching for local events, and finally, searching for opportunities to participate in scientific research in their area), then we recorded their opinions and impressions. The main aspects to be evaluated were the mobile app's usability, accessibility, cultural relevance, and adoption.\nOur findings highlight the users' need for a system that enables interaction with different modalities, the need for a system that can provide personalized and culturally and contextually relevant information, and the role of community and physical spaces in increasing the use of Lola.\nOur study shows that, when designing for Black American older adults, a multimodal interaction with the generative AI system can allow individuals to choose their own interaction way and style based upon their interaction preferences and external constraints. This flexibility of interaction modes can guarantee an inclusive and engaging generative AI experience.",

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) requires new approaches for human-AI interfaces that are different from classic human-computer interfaces. In developing a system that is conducive to the analysis and use of health big data (HBD), reflecting the empirical characteristics of users who have performed HBD analysis is the most crucial aspect to consider. Recently, human-centered design methodology, a field of user-centered design, has been expanded and is used not only to develop types of products but also technologies and services.\nThis study was conducted to integrate and analyze users' experiences along the HBD analysis journey using the human-centered design methodology and reflect them in the development of AI agents that support future HBD analysis. This research aims to help accelerate the development of novel human-AI interfaces for AI agents that support the analysis and use of HBD, which will be urgently needed in the near future.\nUsing human-centered design methodology, we collected data through shadowing and in-depth interviews with 16 people with experience in analyzing and using HBD. We identified users' empirical characteristics, emotions, pain points, and needs related to HBD analysis and use and created personas and journey maps.\nThe general characteristics of participants (n=16) were as follows: the majority were in their 40s (n=6, 38%) and held a PhD degree (n=10, 63%). Professors (n=7, 44%) and health care personnel (n=10, 63%) represented the largest professional groups. Participants' experiences with big data analysis varied, with 25% (n=4) being beginners and 38% (n=6) having extensive experience. Common analysis methods included statistical analysis (n=7, 44%) and data mining (n=6, 38%). Qualitative findings from shadowing and in-depth interviews revealed key challenges: lack of knowledge on using analytical solutions, crisis management difficulties during errors, and inadequate understanding of health care data and clinical decision-making, especially among non-health care professionals. Three types of personas and journey maps-health care professionals as big data analysis beginners, health care professionals who have experience in big data analytics, and non-health care professionals who are experts in big data analytics-were derived. They showed a need for personalized platforms tailored to the user level, appropriate direction through a navigation function, a crisis management support system, communication and sharing among users, and expert linkage service.\nThe knowledge obtained from this study can be leveraged in designing an AI agent to support future HBD analysis and use. This is expected to further increase the usability of HBD by helping users perform effective use of HBD more easily.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between maternal obesity and childhood cognitive development remains unclear. Prior studies did not adjust for important confounders, and preterm infants are a developmentally distinct group that remains scarcely examined.\nTo determine whether maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) is associated with offspring intelligence quotient (IQ) up to 5\u2009years and whether this relationship varies with gestational age.\nData from two French birth cohorts, EDEN (all gestational ages) and EPIPAGE-2 (preterm children born between 24 and 34\u2009weeks of gestation), were used for this study. Maternal prepregnancy weight and height were used to calculate prepregnancy BMI. The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence was used to assess child IQ around 5\u2009years. Multivariable models were adjusted for confounders, including socioeconomic status and paternal BMI.\nAnalytical cohorts included 1100 children from EDEN and 2629 from EPIPAGE-2. Lower intellectual functioning (full-scale IQ\u2009<\u200985) was observed in 8.1% of children in EDEN and 19.6% in EPIPAGE-2. The prevalence of maternal obesity was 13.6% (EDEN) and 21.3% (EPIPAGE-2) among children with lower intellectual functioning compared to 8.9% (EDEN) and 12.9% (EPIPAGE-2) among children with normal intellectual functioning. Maternal prepregnancy obesity was associated with an approximately 3-point decrease in full-scale IQ scores in fully adjusted models (adjusted \u03b2 -2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.6, -0.1 and -2.6, 95% CI -4.7, -0.6 in EDEN and EPIPAGE-2, respectively). In EDEN, maternal obesity was associated with lower scores in the verbal IQ domain. Among infants born preterm (EPIPAGE-2), maternal obesity was associated with lower scores in the processing, reasoning, and verbal IQ domains. Adjustment for paternal BMI did not change the magnitude of the relationship with maternal obesity.\nHigh maternal prepregnancy BMI is associated with child cognitive development around 5\u2009years of age.",

    "abstract": "Although the HaCaT keratinocyte model has been used in previous research to study the effects of antipsoriatic agents, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced proliferation and signal transduction in psoriasis-like keratinocytes.\nThis study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms and pathways associated with psoriasis-like inflammation caused by IMQ in human keratinocytes.\nHaCaT cells were exposed to different concentrations of IMQ to induce inflammation similar to that observed in psoriasis. Cell viability was evaluated using the MTT assay and cell morphology was examined using phase-contrast microscopy. Gene expression profiles were analyzed through whole transcriptome sequencing, followed by bio-informatics network analysis using IPA software. The GSEA was conducted with the aim of identifying enriched pathways. The expression of key cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 was confirmed by QPCR. Artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms were used to predict potential diseases and phenotypes associated with the observed gene profiles.\nIMQ treatment demonstrated a substantial positive impact on cell survival without any detectable alterations in the morphology of HaCaT cells. A comprehensive analysis of the entire set of transcribed genes identified 513 genes that exhibited differential expression. Bioinformatics analysis revealed key pathways associated with immune response, cellular proliferation, and cytokine signaling. GSEA identified significant enrichment in the IFN-\u03b3 response and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. QPCR analysis confirmed the increased mRNA expression levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in cells treated with IMQ. AI/ML algorithms have identified potential correlations with diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, lympho-proliferative malignancy, and autoimmune disorders.\nOur results highlight the importance of specific genes and pathways, particularly those associated with IFN-\u03b3 pathway and IL-6/JAK-STAT signaling. AI/ML predictions indicate potential associations with various diseases and provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for psoriasis and related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Our previous research demonstrated that a large language model (LLM) based on the transformer architecture, specifically the MegaMolBART encoder with an XGBoost classifier, effectively predicts the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of compounds. However, the permeability coefficients of compounds that can traverse this barrier remain unclear. Additionally, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) characteristics of substances obtained from the Natural Product Research Laboratory (NPRL) at China Medical University Hospital (CMUH) have not yet been determined.\nThe study aims to investigate the pharmacokinetic ADME properties and BBB permeability coefficients of NPRL compounds.\nA combined model using a transformer-based MegaMolBART encoder and XGBoost classifier was employed to predict BBB permeability. Machine learning (ML) tools from Discovery Studio were used to assess the ADME characteristics of the NPRL compounds. The CCK-8 assay was conducted to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of NPRL compounds on bEnd.3 brain endothelial cells after exposure to 10 \u03bcg/mL of the compounds. We assessed the permeability coefficient by subjecting bEnd.3 cell monolayers to the test compounds and measuring the permeability of FITC-dextran.\nThere were 4956 compounds that could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB+) and 2851 that could not (BBB-) in the B3DB dataset that was utilized for training. A total of 2461 BBB+ and 2184 BBB- compounds were used in the NPRL-CMUH dataset for testing. The permeability coefficient of temozolomide (TMZ) and 21 other BBB + compounds exceeded 10 \u00d7 10\nComputer-based predictions for the NPRL of CMUH compounds regarding their capacity to traverse the BBB are verified by the findings. Artificial intelligence (AI) prediction models have effectively identified the potential ADME characteristics of various compounds.",

    "abstract": "The Natural Product Research Laboratory (NPRL) of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH) was established in collaboration with CMUH and Professor Kuo-Hsiung Lee from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The laboratory collection features over 6000 natural products worldwide, including pure compounds and semi-synthetic derivatives. This is the most comprehensive and fully operational natural product database in Taiwan. This review article explores the history and development of the NPRL of CMUH. We then provide an overview of the recent applications and impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in new drug discovery. Finally, we examine advanced powerful AI-tools and related software to explain how these resources can be utilized in research on large-scale drug data libraries. This article presents a drug research and development (R&D) platform that combines AI with the NPRL. We believe that this approach will reduce resource wastage and enhance the research capabilities of Taiwan's academic and industrial sectors in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming cardiovascular imaging by offering advancements across multiple modalities, including echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography (CCT), cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), interventional cardiology, nuclear medicine, and electrophysiology. This review explores the clinical applications of AI within each of these areas, highlighting its ability to improve patient selection, reduce image acquisition time, enhance image optimization, facilitate the integration of data from different imaging modality and clinical sources, improve diagnosis and risk stratification. Moreover, we illustrate both the advantages and the limitations of AI across these modalities, acknowledging that while AI can significantly aid in diagnosis, risk stratification, and workflow efficiency, it cannot replace the expertise of cardiologists. Instead, AI serves as a powerful tool to streamline routine tasks, allowing clinicians to focus on complex cases where human judgement remains essential. By accelerating image interpretation and improving diagnostic accuracy, AI holds great potential to improve patient care and clinical decision-making in cardiovascular imaging.",

    "abstract": "Despite the expanding therapeutic options available to cancer patients, therapeutic resistance, disease recurrence, and metastasis persist as hallmark challenges in the treatment of cancer. The rise to prominence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in many realms of human activities is compelling the consideration of its capabilities as a potential lever to advance the development of effective cancer treatments. This article presents a hypothetical case study on the application of generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) to the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). The case explores the design of GPT-supported adaptive intermittent therapy for mPC. Testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are assumed to be repeatedly monitored while treatment may involve a combination of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), androgen receptor-signalling inhibitors (ARSI), chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The analysis covers various questions relevant to the configuration, training, and inferencing of GPTs for the case of mPC treatment with a particular attention to risk mitigation regarding the hallucination problem and its implications to clinical integration of GenAI technologies. The case study provides elements of an actionable pathway to the realization of GenAI-assisted adaptive treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. As such, the study is expected to help facilitate the design of clinical trials of GenAI-supported cancer treatments.",

    "abstract": "The National Library of Medicine (NLM) currently indexes close to a million articles each year pertaining to more than 5300 medicine and life sciences journals. Of these, a significant number of articles contain critical information about the structure, genetics, and function of genes and proteins in normal and disease states. These articles are identified by the NLM curators, and a manual link is created between these articles and the corresponding gene records at the NCBI Gene database. Thus, the information is interconnected with all the NLM resources, services which bring considerable value to life sciences. National Library of Medicine aims to provide timely access to all metadata, and this necessitates that the article indexing scales to the volume of the published literature. On the other hand, although automatic information extraction methods have been shown to achieve accurate results in biomedical text mining research, it remains difficult to evaluate them on established pipelines and integrate them within the daily workflows.\nHere, we demonstrate how our machine learning model, GNorm2, which achieved state-of-the art performance on identifying genes and their corresponding species at the same time handling innate textual ambiguities, could be integrated with the established daily workflow at the NLM and evaluated for its performance in this new environment.\nWe worked with 8 biomedical curator experts and evaluated the integration using these parameters: (1) gene identification accuracy, (2) interannotator agreement with and without GNorm2, (3) GNorm2 potential bias, and (4) indexing consistency and efficiency. We identified key interface changes that significantly helped the curators to maximize the GNorm2 benefit, and further improved the GNorm2 algorithm to cover 135 species of genes including viral and bacterial genes, based on the biocurator expert survey.\nGNorm2 is currently in the process of being fully integrated into the regular curator's workflow.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) scribes for clinical documentation are likely to be among the first AI tools to affect the day-to-day practice of psychiatry, yet many psychiatrists are unfamiliar with them. This article introduces psychiatrists to AI scribes, including their potential benefits and risks. AI scribes may enhance efficiency, reduce physician burnout, and improve patient-physician rapport by automating documentation processes. Key concerns include privacy, accuracy, and the ability to capture nuanced patient communication. Initial recommendations for responsibly integrating AI scribes into psychiatric practice are provided, emphasizing the importance of balancing technological benefits with careful oversight.",

    "abstract": "To characterize the opinions of patients undergoing infertility treatment on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in their care.\nPatients planning or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) or frozen embryo transfers were invited to complete an anonymous electronic survey from April to June 2024. The survey collected demographics, technological affinity, general perception of AI, and its applications to fertility care. Patient-reported trust of AI compared to a physician for fertility care (e.g. gamete selection, gonadotropin doing, and stimulation length) were analyzed. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and subgroup analyses by age, occupation, and parity were performed. Chi-squared tests were used to compare categorical variables.\nA total of 200 patients completed the survey and were primarily female (n\u2009=\u2009193/200) and of reproductive age (mean 37\u00a0years). Patients were well educated with high technological affinity. Respondents were familiar with AI (93%) and generally supported its use in medicine (55%), but fewer trusted AI-informed reproductive care (46%). More patients disagreed (37%) that AI should be used to determine gonadotropin dose or stimulation length compared to embryo selection (26.5%; p\u2009=\u20090.01). In the setting of disagreement between physician and AI recommendation, patients preferred the physician-based recommendation in all treatment-related decisions. However, a larger proportion favored AI recommendations for gamete (22%) and embryo (14.5%) selection, compared to gonadotropin dosing (6.5%) or stimulation length (7.0%). Most would not be willing to pay more for AI-informed fertility care.\nIn this highly educated infertile population familiar with AI, patients still prefer physician-based recommendations compared with AI.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI-driven technologies are transforming industries across the board, with the pharmaceutical sector emerging as a frontrunner beneficiary. This article explores the growing impact of AI and Machine Learning (ML) within pharmaceutical Regulatory Affairs, particularly in dossier preparation, compilation, documentation, submission, review, and regulatory compliance. By automating time-intensive tasks, these technologies streamline workflows, accelerate result generation, and shorten the product approval timeline. However, despite their immense potential, AI and ML also introduce new challenges. Issues such as AI software validation, data management security and privacy, potential biases, ethical concerns, and change management requirements must be addressed. This review highlights current AI-based tools actively used by regulatory professionals such as DocShifter, Veeva Vault, RiskWatch, Freyr SubmitPro, Litera Microsystems, cortical.io etc., examines both the benefits and obstacles of integrating these advanced systems into regulatory practices. Given the rapid pace of technological innovation, the article underscores the need for proactive collaboration with regulatory bodies to manage these developments. It also stresses the importance of adapting to evolving regulatory frameworks and embracing new technologies. Although regulatory agencies like the United Sates Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) are working on guidelines for AI and ML adoption, clear, standardized protocols are still in the works. While the journey ahead may be complex, the integration of AI promises to fundamentally reshape regulatory processes and accelerate the approval of safe, effective pharmaceutical products.",

    "abstract": "Superficial fungal infections are among the most common infections in world, they mainly affect skin, nails and scalp without further invasion. Superficial fungal diseases are conventionally diagnosed with direct microscopy, fungal culture or histopathology, treated with topical or systemic antifungal agents and prevented in immunocompetent patients by improving personal hygiene. However, conventional diagnostic tests can be time-consuming, also treatment can be insufficient or ineffective and prevention can prove to be demanding. Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a digital system having an intelligence akin to a human being. The concept of AI has existed since 1956, but hasn't been practicalised until recently. AI has revolutionised medical research in the recent years, promising to influence almost all specialties of medicine.\nAn increasing number of articles have been published about the usage of AI in cutaneous mycoses.\nIn this review, the key findings of articles about utilisation of AI in diagnosis, treatment and prevention of superficial fungal infections are summarised. Moreover, the need for more research and development is highlighted.\nFifty-four studies were reviewed. Onychomycosis was the most researched superficial fungal infection. AI can be used diagnosing fungi in macroscopic and microscopic images and classify them to some extent. AI can be a tool and be used as a part of something bigger to diagnose superficial mycoses.\nAI can be used in all three steps of diagnosing, treating and preventing. AI can be a tool complementary to the clinician's skills and laboratory results.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed objective performance, usability, and acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) by people with vision impairment. The goal was to provide evidence-based data to enhance technology selection for people with vision loss (PVL) based on their loss and needs.\nUsing a cross-sectional, counterbalanced, cross-over study involving 25 PVL, we compared performance using two smart glasses (OrCam and Envision Glasses) and two AI apps (Seeing AI and Google Lookout). We refer to these as assistive artificial intelligence implementations (AAIIs). Completion and timing were quantified for three task categories: text, text in columns, and searching and identifying. Usability was evaluated with the System Usability Scale (SUS).\nThe odds ratios (ORs) of being able to complete Text tasks were significantly higher when using AAIIs compared to the baseline. OR when performing \"Searching and Identifying\" tasks varied among AAIIs, with Seeing AI and Envision improving the performance of more tasks than Lookout or OrCam. Participants expressed high satisfaction with the AAIIs.\nDespite the findings that performance on some tasks and when using some AAIIs did not result in a greater number of PVL being able to complete the tasks, there was overall high satisfaction, reflecting an acceptance of AI as an assistive technology and the promise of this developing technology.\nThis evidence-based performance data provide guidelines for clinicians when recommending an AAII to PVL.",

    "abstract": "To reveal problems of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosing gastric-type mucin-positive (GMPLs) and gastric-type mucin-negative (GMNLs) cervical lesions.\nWe selected 172 patients suspected to have lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia; their pelvic MR images were categorised into the training (n = 132) and validation (n = 40) groups. The images of the validation group were read twice by three pairs of six readers to reveal the accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The readers evaluated three images (sagittal T2-weighted image [T2WI], axial T2WI, and axial T1-weighted image [T1WI]) in every patient. The pre-trained convolutional neural network (pCNN) was used to differentiate between GMPLs and GMNLs and perform four-fold cross-validation using cases in the training group. The accuracy and AUC were obtained using the MR images in the validation group. For each case, three images (sagittal T2WI and axial T2WI/T1WI) were entered into the CNN. Calculations were performed twice independently. ICC (2,1) between first- and second-time CNN was evaluated, and these results were compared with those of readers.\nThe highest accuracy of readers was 77.50%. The highest ICC (1,1) between a pair of readers was 0.750. All ICC (2,1) values were <0.7, indicating poor agreement; the highest accuracy of CNN was 82.50%. The AUC did not differ significantly between the CNN and readers. The ICC (2,1) of CNN was 0.965.\nVariation in the inter-reader or intra-reader accuracy in MRI diagnosis limits differentiation between GMPL and GMNL. CNN is nearly as accurate as readers but improves the reproducibility of diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Measuring neurocognitive functioning in children requires validated, age-appropriate instruments that are adapted to the local cultural and linguistic context. We sought to evaluate the usability and psychometric properties of five tools that assess general intelligence, executive functioning, and sustained attention among Tanzanian children.\nWe adapted five age-appropriate neurocognitive assessment batteries from previously published assessment materials to the Tanzanian context. We enrolled children 6 months to 12 years of age residing in the rural ward of Yombo, Pwani Region. Feasibility and acceptability of all instruments was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively, including measurement of refusal rates, ceiling or floor effects, and time requirements. We assessed internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha and convergent validity using standard correlation analysis. Score gradients across age were explored using polynomial regression analysis.\nAll five instruments required minimal adaptations to the Tanzanian context. Two-hundred sixty one children aged 6 months to 12 years completed the assessment. Refusal rates were consistently low (5.9% at the highest) and no ceiling or floor effects of measurements were observed. Feedback from assessors and caregivers indicated adequate test durations and generally high acceptability of instruments. All instruments showed good internal consistency with Cronbach alphas at least 0.84 for all tests. We found satisfactory convergent validity; all test scores strongly correlated with age.\nThe five instruments identified to assess general intelligence, executive functioning, and sustained attention constructs in Tanzanian children seem to work well in this setting.",

    "abstract": "Bed regulation within Brazil's National Health System (SUS) plays a crucial role in managing care for patients in need of hospitalization. In Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, the RegulaRN Leitos Gerais platform was the information system developed to register requests for bed regulation for COVID-19 cases. However, the platform was expanded to cover a range of diseases that require hospitalization. This study explored different machine learning models in the RegulaRN database, from October 2021 to January 2024, totaling 47,056 regulations. From the data obtained, 12 features were selected from the 24 available. After that, blank and inconclusive data were removed, as well as the outcomes that had values other than discharge and death, rendering a binary classification. Data was also correlated, balanced, and divided into training and test portions for application in machine learning models. The results showed better accuracy (87.77%) and recall (87.77%) for the XGBoost model, and higher precision (87.85%) and F1-Score (87.56%) for the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, respectively. As for Specificity (82.94%) and ROC-AUC (82.13%), the Multilayer Perceptron with SGD optimizer obtained the highest scores. The results evidenced which models could adequately assist medical regulators during the decision-making process for bed regulation, enabling even more effective regulation and, consequently, greater availability of beds and a decrease in waiting time for patients.",

    "abstract": "This paper intends to solve the limitations of the existing methods to deal with the comments of tourist attractions. With the technical support of Artificial Intelligence (AI), an online comment method of tourist attractions based on text mining model and attention mechanism is proposed. In the process of text mining, the attention mechanism is used to calculate the contribution of each topic to text representation on the topic layer of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BiGRU) can effectively capture the temporal relationship and semantic dependence in the text through its powerful sequence modeling ability, thus achieving a more accurate classification of emotional tendencies. In order to verify the performance of the proposed ATT-LDA- Bigelow model, online comments about tourist attractions are collected from Ctrip.com, and users' emotional tendencies towards different scenic spots are analyzed. The results show that this model has the best emotion classification effect in online comments of scenic spots, with the accuracy and F1 value reaching 93.85% and 93.68% respectively, which is superior to other emotion classification models. The proposed method not only improves the accuracy of sentiment analysis, but also provides strong support for the optimization of tourism recommendation system and provides more comprehensive, objective and accurate tourism information for scenic spot managers and tourism enterprises. This achievement is expected to bring new enlightenment and breakthrough to the research and practice in related fields.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly applied in healthcare to improve patient care and clinical outcomes. We previously developed an AI model using ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) codes with other clinical variables to predict in-hospital mortality among trauma patients from a nationwide database. This study aimed to externally validate the performance of the AI model. Validation was conducted using a multicenter retrospective cohort study design, analyzing patient data from January 2020 to December 2021. The study included trauma patients based on specific ICD-10 codes, with other clinical variables. The performance of the AI model was evaluated against conventional metrics, including the ISS, and the ICISS (ICD-based ISS), using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analyses. Data from 4,439 patients were analyzed. The AI model demonstrated high overall performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.9448 and a balanced accuracy of 85.08%, thereby outperforming traditional scoring systems such as ISS, or ICISS. Furthermore, the model accurately predicted mortality across datasets from each hospital (AUROCs of 0.9234 and 0.9653, respectively) despite significant differences in hospital characteristics. In the subset of patients with ISS\u2009<\u20099, the model showed a robust AUROC of 0.9043, indicating its effectiveness in predicting mortality, even in cases with lower-severity injuries. For patients with ISSs\u2009\u2265\u20099, the model maintained high sensitivity (93.60%) and balanced accuracy (77.08%), proving its reliability in more severe injury cases. External validation demonstrated the AI model's high predictive accuracy and reliability in assessing in-hospital mortality risk among trauma patients across different injury severities and heterogeneous cohorts. These findings support the model's potential integration into emergency departments and offer a significant tool for enhancing patient triage and treatment protocols.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning and its specialized forms, such as Artificial Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks, are increasingly being used for detecting and managing gastrointestinal conditions. Recent advancements involve using Artificial Neural Network models to enhance predictive accuracy for severe lower gastrointestinal (LGI) bleeding outcomes, including the need for surgery. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI)-guided predictive models have shown promise in improving management outcomes. While much literature focuses on AI in early neoplasia detection, this review highlights AI's role in managing LGI and small bowel disorders, including risk stratification for LGI bleeding, quality control, evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease, and video capsule endoscopy reading. Overall, the integration of AI into routine clinical practice is still developing, with ongoing research aimed at addressing current limitations and gaps in patient care.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) assists recruiting and job searching. Such systems can be biased against certain characteristics. This results in potential misrepresentations and consequent inequalities related to people with mental health disorders. Hence occupational and mental health bias in existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) models used in recruiting and job hunting must be assessed. We examined occupational bias against mental health disorders in NLP models through relationships between occupations, employability, and psychiatric diagnoses. We investigated Word2Vec and GloVe embedding algorithms through analogy questions and graphical representation of cosine similarities. Word2Vec embeddings exhibit minor bias against mental health disorders when asked analogies regarding employability attributes and no evidence of bias when asked analogies regarding high earning jobs. GloVe embeddings view common mental health disorders such as depression less healthy and less employable than severe mental health disorders and most physical health conditions. Overall, physical, and psychiatric disorders are seen as similarly healthy and employable. Both algorithms appear to be safe for use in downstream task without major repercussions. Further research is needed to confirm this. This project was funded by the London Interdisciplinary Social Science Doctoral Training Programme (LISS-DTP).

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence techniques are being used to analyse vast amounts of medical data and assist in the accurate and early diagnosis of diseases. The common brain related diseases are faced by most of the people which affects the structure and function of the brain. Artificial neural networks have been extensively used for disease prediction and diagnosis due to their ability to learn complex patterns and relationships from large datasets. However, there are some problems like over-fitting, under-fitting, vanishing gradient and increased elapsed time occurred in the course of data analysis and prediction which\u00a0results in performance degradation of the model. Therefore, a complex structure perception is much essential by avoiding over-fitting and under-fitting. This empirical study presents a statistical reduction approach along with deep hyper optimization (SRADHO) technique for better feature selection and disease classification with reduced elapsed time. Deep hyper optimization combines deep learning models with hyperparameter tuning to automatically identify the most relevant features, optimizing model accuracy and reducing dimensionality. SRADHO is used to calibrate the weight, bias and select the optimal number of hyperparameters in the hidden layer using Bayesian optimization approach. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic model to efficiently search the hyperparameter space, identifying configurations that maximize model performance while minimizing the number of evaluations. Three benchmark datasets and the classifier models logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, K-nearest neighbour, support vector machine and Na\u00efve Bayes are used for experimentation. The proposed SRADHO algorithm achieves 98.2% of accuracy, 97.2% of precision rate, 98.3% of recall rate and 98.1% of F1-Score value with 0.3% of error rate. The execution time for SRADHO algorithm is 12\u00a0s.",

    "abstract": "The use of technology in healthcare and healthcare education settings has increased rapidly across the United States and accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, perceptions of new technologies in clinical nursing and nursing education are not well understood. Yet, understanding perceptions of registered nurses and nursing students toward advanced technology and artificial intelligence in clinical care and education is crucial if we are to implement these care delivery and educational innovations. This literature review investigates existing literature on registered nurses' and nursing students' attitudes toward advanced technology and artificial intelligence in nursing, including nursing education. Ten peer-reviewed studies published between 2017 and 2022 were reviewed. Findings revealed positive perceptions, such as improved patient care, efficiency, and reduced human error, but also concerns about job displacement, loss of human touch, and ethical/legal issues. Challenges in implementation, adequate training in technologies, and how technologies may reduce the human connection aspect of nursing care were identified. By recognizing the attitudes and perceptions of registered nurses and nursing students toward these advanced technologies, we can better ensure that it is ethically, effectively, and responsibly integrated into nursing practice and education.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) predictive models in primary health care have the potential to enhance population health by rapidly and accurately identifying individuals who should receive care and health services. However, these models also carry the risk of perpetuating or amplifying existing biases toward diverse groups. We identified a gap in the current understanding of strategies used to assess and mitigate bias in primary health care algorithms related to individuals' personal or protected attributes.\nThis study aimed to describe the attempts, strategies, and methods used to mitigate bias in AI models within primary health care, to identify the diverse groups or protected attributes considered, and to evaluate the results of these approaches on both bias reduction and AI model performance.\nWe conducted a scoping review following Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines, searching Medline (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (Ovid), and Web of Science databases for studies published between January 1, 2017, and November 15, 2022. Pairs of reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, applied selection criteria, and performed full-text screening. Discrepancies regarding study inclusion were resolved by consensus. Following reporting standards for AI in health care, we extracted data on study objectives, model features, targeted diverse groups, mitigation strategies used, and results. Using the mixed methods appraisal tool, we appraised the quality of the studies.\nAfter removing 585 duplicates, we screened 1018 titles and abstracts. From the remaining 189 full-text articles, we included 17 studies. The most frequently investigated protected attributes were race (or ethnicity), examined in 12 of the 17 studies, and sex (often identified as gender), typically classified as \"male versus female\" in 10 of the studies. We categorized bias mitigation approaches into four clusters: (1) modifying existing AI models or datasets, (2) sourcing data from electronic health records, (3) developing tools with a \"human-in-the-loop\" approach, and (4) identifying ethical principles for informed decision-making. Algorithmic preprocessing methods, such as relabeling and reweighing data, along with natural language processing techniques that extract data from unstructured notes, showed the greatest potential for bias mitigation. Other methods aimed at enhancing model fairness included group recalibration and the application of the equalized odds metric. However, these approaches sometimes exacerbated prediction errors across groups or led to overall model miscalibrations.\nThe results suggest that biases toward diverse groups are more easily mitigated when data are open-sourced, multiple stakeholders are engaged, and during the algorithm's preprocessing stage. Further empirical studies that include a broader range of groups, such as Indigenous peoples in Canada, are needed to validate and expand upon these findings.\nOSF Registry osf.io/9ngz5/; https://osf.io/9ngz5/.\nRR2-10.2196/46684.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome. Accurate risk stratification and early diagnosis of HF are challenging as its signs and symptoms are non-specific. We propose to address this global challenge by developing the STRATIFYHF artificial intelligence-driven decision support system (DSS), which uses novel analytical methods in determining the risk, diagnosis and prognosis of HF. The primary aim of the present study is to collect prospective clinical data to validate the STRATIFYHF DSS (in terms of diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) as a tool to predict the risk, diagnosis and progression of HF. The secondary outcomes are the demographic and clinical predictors of risk, diagnosis and progression of HF.\nSTRATIFYHF is a prospective, multicentre, longitudinal study that will recruit up to 1600 individuals (n=800 suspected/at risk of HF and n=800 diagnosed with HF) aged \u226545 years old, with up to 24 months of follow-up observations. Individuals suspected of HF will be divided into two categories based on current definitions and predefined inclusion criteria. All participants will have their medical history recorded, along with data on physical examination (signs and symptoms), blood tests including serum natriuretic peptides levels, ECG and echocardiogram results, as well as demographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle data, and use of complete novel technologies (cardiac output response to stress test and voice recognition biomarkers). All measurements will be recorded at baseline and at 12-month follow-up, with medical history and hospitalisation also recorded at 24-month follow-up. Cardiovascular MRI assessment will be completed in a subset of participants (n=20-40) from eligible clinical centres only at baseline. Each clinical centre will recruit a subset of participants (n=30) who will complete a 6-month home-based monitoring of clinical characteristics and accelerometry (wrist-worn monitor) to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the STRATIFYHF mobile application. Focus groups and semistructured interviews will be conducted with up to 15 healthcare professionals and up to 20 study participants (10 at risk of HF and 10 diagnosed with HF) to explore the needs of patients and healthcare professionals prior to the development of the STRATIFYHF DSS and to evaluate the acceptability of this mobile application.\nEthical approval has been granted by the East Midlands - Leicester Central Research Ethics Committee (24/EM/0101). Dissemination activities will include journal publications and presentations at conferences, as well as development of training materials and delivery of focused training on the STRATIFYHF DSS and mobile application. We will develop and propose policy guidelines for integration of the STRATIFYHF DSS and mobile application into the standard of care in the HF care pathway.\nNCT06377319.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence-driven clinical decision support systems (AI-CDSSs) are pivotal tools for doctors to improve diagnostic and treatment processes, as well as improve the efficiency and quality of health care services. However, not all doctors trust artificial intelligence (AI) technology, and many remain skeptical and unwilling to adopt these systems.\nThis study aimed to explore in depth the factors influencing doctors' willingness to adopt AI-CDSSs and assess the causal relationships among these factors to gain a better understanding for promoting the clinical application and widespread implementation of these systems.\nBased on the unified\u00a0theory\u00a0of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, we have proposed and designed a framework for doctors' willingness to adopt AI-CDSSs. We conducted a nationwide questionnaire survey in China and performed fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to explore the willingness of doctors to adopt AI-CDSSs in different types of medical institutions and assess the factors influencing their willingness.\nThe survey was administered to doctors working in tertiary hospitals and primary/secondary hospitals across China. We received 450 valid responses out of 578 questionnaires distributed, indicating a robust response rate of 77.9%. Our analysis of the influencing factors and adoption pathways revealed that doctors in tertiary hospitals exhibited 6 distinct pathways for AI-CDSS adoption, which were centered on technology-driven pathways, individual-driven pathways, and technology-individual dual-driven pathways. Doctors in primary/secondary hospitals demonstrated 3 adoption pathways, which were centered on technology-individual and organization-individual dual-driven pathways. There were commonalities in the factors influencing adoption across different medical institutions, such as the positive perception of AI technology's utility and individual readiness to try new technologies. There were also variations in the influence of facilitating conditions among doctors at different medical institutions, especially primary/secondary hospitals.\nFrom the perspective of the 6 pathways for doctors at tertiary hospitals and the 3 pathways for doctors at primary/secondary hospitals, performance expectancy and personal innovativeness were 2 indispensable and core conditions in the pathways to achieving favorable willingness to adopt AI-CDSSs.",

    "abstract": "With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), medicine has entered the era of intelligent medicine, and various aspects, such as medical education and talent cultivation, are also being redefined. The cultivation of clinical thinking abilities poses a formidable challenge even for seasoned clinical educators, as offline training modalities often fall short in bridging the divide between current practice and the desired ideal. Consequently, there arises an imperative need for the expeditious development of a web-based database, tailored to empower physicians in their quest to learn and hone their clinical reasoning skills.\nThis study aimed to introduce an app named \"XueYiKu,\" which includes consultations, physical examinations, auxiliary examinations, and diagnosis, incorporating AI and actual complete hospital medical records to build an online-learning platform using human-computer interaction.\nThe \"XueYiKu\" app was designed as a contactless, self-service, trial-and-error system application based on actual complete hospital medical records and natural language processing technology to comprehensively assess the \"clinical competence\" of residents at different stages. Case extraction was performed at a hospital's case data center, and the best-matching cases were differentiated through natural language processing, word segmentation, synonym conversion, and sorting. More than 400 teaching cases covering 65 kinds of diseases were released for students to learn, and the subjects covered internal medicine, surgery, gynecology and obstetrics, and pediatrics. The difficulty of learning cases was divided into four levels in ascending order. Moreover, the learning and teaching effects were evaluated using 6 dimensions covering systematicness, agility, logic, knowledge expansion, multidimensional evaluation indicators, and preciseness.\nFrom the app's first launch on the Android platform in May 2019 to the last version updated in May 2023, the total number of teacher and student users was 6209 and 1180, respectively. The top 3 subjects most frequently learned were respirology (n=606, 24.1%), general surgery (n=506, 20.1%), and urinary surgery (n=390, 15.5%). For diseases, pneumonia was the most frequently learned, followed by cholecystolithiasis (n=216, 14.1%), benign prostate hyperplasia (n=196, 12.8%), and bladder tumor (n=193, 12.6%). Among 479 students, roughly a third (n=168, 35.1%) scored in the 60 to 80 range, and half of them scored over 80 points (n=238, 49.7%). The app enabled medical students' learning to become more active and self-motivated, with a variety of formats, and provided real-time feedback through assessments on the platform. The learning effect was satisfactory overall and provided important precedence for establishing scientific models and methods for assessing clinical thinking skills in the future.\nThe integration of AI and medical education will undoubtedly assist in the restructuring of education processes; promote the evolution of the education ecosystem; and provide new convenient ways for independent learning, interactive communication, and educational resource sharing.",

The top 3 subjects most frequently learned were respirology (n=606, 24.1%), general surgery (n=506, 20.1%), and urinary surgery (n=390, 15.5%). For diseases, pneumonia was the most frequently learned, followed by cholecystolithiasis (n=216, 14.1%), benign prostate hyperplasia (n=196, 12.8%), and bladder tumor (n=193, 12.6%). Among 479 students, roughly a third (n=168, 35.1%) scored in the 60 to 80 range, and half of them scored over 80 points (n=238, 49.7%). The app enabled medical students' learning to become more active and self-motivated, with a variety of formats, and provided real-time feedback through assessments on the platform. The learning effect was satisfactory overall and provided important precedence for establishing scientific models and methods for assessing clinical thinking skills in the future.",

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of cleft lip and palate (CLP) requires a multiplane examination, demanding high technical proficiency from radiologists. Therefore, this study aims to develop and validate the first artificial intelligence (AI)-based model (CLP-Net) for fully automated multi-plane localization in three-dimensional(3D) ultrasound during the first trimester.\nThis retrospective study included 418 (394 normal, 24 CLP) 3D ultrasound from 288 pregnant woman between July 2022 to October 2024 from Shenzhen Guangming District People's Hospital during the 11-13\nIn normal test set, mean angle(\u00b1\u2009SD)\u00b0 and distance(\u00b1\u2009SD)mm differences were 6.24\u2009\u00b1\u20094.83, 9.81\u2009\u00b1\u20095.48, 15.36\u2009\u00b1\u200918.14 and 0.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.72, 1.36\u2009\u00b1\u20091.15, 1.96\u2009\u00b1\u20092.35 for MSP\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, RTP\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and MAP\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, NCC and SSIM were 0.931\u2009\u00b1\u20090.079, 0.819\u2009\u00b1\u20090.122, 0.781\u2009\u00b1\u20090.157 and 0.896\u2009\u00b1\u20090.058, 0.785\u2009\u00b1\u20090.076, 0.726\u2009\u00b1\u20090.088 respectively.

    "abstract": "Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into public health education represents a pivotal advancement in medical knowledge dissemination, particularly for chronic diseases such as asthma. This study assesses the accuracy and comprehensiveness of ChatGPT, a conversational AI model, in providing asthma-related information.\nEmploying a rigorous mixed-methods approach, healthcare professionals evaluated ChatGPT's responses to the Asthma General Knowledge Questionnaire for Adults (AGKQA), a standardized instrument covering various asthma-related topics. Responses were graded for accuracy and completeness and analyzed using statistical tests to assess reproducibility and consistency.\nChatGPT showed notable proficiency in conveying asthma knowledge, with flawless success in the etiology and pathophysiology categories and substantial accuracy in medication information (70%). However, limitations were noted in medication-related responses, where mixed accuracy (30%) highlights the need for further refinement of ChatGPT's capabilities to ensure reliability in critical areas of asthma education. Reproducibility analysis demonstrated a consistent 100% rate across all categories, affirming ChatGPT's reliability in delivering uniform information. Statistical analyses further underscored ChatGPT's stability and reliability.\nThese findings underscore ChatGPT's promise as a valuable educational tool for asthma while emphasizing the necessity of ongoing improvements to address observed limitations, particularly regarding medication-related information.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel methodology for evaluating communication performance in rotating electric machines using Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) measurements coupled with artificial intelligence. The proposed approach focuses on assessing the quality of wireless signals in the complex, dynamic environment inside these machines, where factors like reflections, metallic surfaces, and rotational movements can significantly impact communication. RSSI is used as a key parameter to monitor real-time signal behavior, enabling a detailed analysis of communication reliability. The methodology comprises several stages, including data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. Various machine learning models are implemented and evaluated. Among these, the SVM model with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel outperforms others, achieving an accuracy of 97%, with high precision and recall scores, confirming its robustness in classifying RSSI data and handling complex signal behavior. The confusion matrix further supports the SVM model's accuracy, showing minimal misclassification.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread use of autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), avoiding collisions has become a challenging problem. Addressing the issue is not straightforward since production efficiency, collision avoidance, and energy consumption are conflicting factors. This paper proposes a novel edge computing method based on vehicle edge intelligence to solve the energy-efficient collision-free machine/AGV scheduling problem. First, a vehicle edge intelligence architecture was built, and the corresponding state transition diagrams for collision-free scheduling were developed. Second, the energy-efficient collision-free machine/AGV scheduling problem was modeled as a multi-objective function with electric capacity constraints, where production efficiency, collision prevention, and energy conservation were comprehensively considered. Third, an artificial plant community algorithm was explored based on the edge intelligence of AGVs. The proposed method utilizes a heuristic search and the swarm intelligence of multiple AGVs to realize energy-efficient collision-free scheduling and is suitable for deploying on embedded platforms for edge computing. Finally, a benchmark dataset was developed, and some benchmark experiments were conducted, where the results revealed that the proposed heuristic method could effectively instruct multiple automatic guided vehicles to avoid collisions with high energy efficiency.",

    "abstract": "We present an artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced monitoring framework designed to assist personnel in evaluating and maintaining animal welfare using a modular architecture. This framework integrates multiple deep learning models to automatically compute metrics relevant to assessing animal well-being. Using deep learning for AI-based vision adapted from industrial applications and human behavioral analysis, the framework includes modules for markerless animal identification and health status assessment (e.g., locomotion score and body condition score). Methods for behavioral analysis are also included to evaluate how nutritional and rearing conditions impact behaviors. These models are initially trained on public datasets and then fine-tuned on original data. We demonstrate the approach through two use cases: a health monitoring system for dairy cattle and a piglet behavior analysis system. The results indicate that scalable deep learning and edge computing solutions can support precision livestock farming by automating welfare assessments and enabling timely, data-driven interventions.",

    "abstract": "Visual examination of nails can reflect human health status. Diseases such as nutritive imbalances and skin diseases can be identified by looking at the colors around the plate part of the nails. We present the AI-based NAILS method to detect fingernails through segmentation and labeling. The NAILS leverages a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network model to segment and label fingernail regions from fingernail images, normalizing RGB values to monitor tiny color changes via a GUI and the use of an HD webcam in real time. The use of normalized RGB values combined with AI-based segmentation for real-time health monitoring is novel and innovative. The NAILS algorithm could be used to self-extract and archive primary signs of diseases in humans, especially in rural areas or when other testing may be not available.",

    "abstract": "One of the health challenges in the 21st century is to rethink approaches to non-communicable disease prevention. A solution is a smart city that implements technology to make health smarter, enables healthcare access, and contributes to all residents' overall well-being. Thus, this paper proposes an architecture to deliver smart health. The architecture is anchored in the Internet of Things and edge computing, and it is driven by artificial intelligence to establish three foundational layers in smart care. Experimental results in a case study on glucose prediction noninvasively show that the architecture senses and acquires data that capture relevant characteristics. The study also establishes a baseline of twelve regression algorithms to assess the non-invasive glucose prediction performance regarding the mean squared error, root mean squared error, and r-squared score, and the catboost regressor outperforms the other models with 218.91 and 782.30 in MSE, 14.80 and 27.97 in RMSE, and 0.81 and 0.31 in R2, respectively, on training and test sets. Future research works involve extending the performance of the algorithms with new datasets, creating and optimizing embedded AI models, deploying edge-IoT with embedded AI for wearable devices, implementing an autonomous AI cloud engine, and implementing federated learning to deliver scalable smart health in a smart city context.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are widely applied in various industries and everyday life, particularly in fields such as virtual assistants, healthcare, and education. However, this paper highlights that existing research has often overlooked the philosophical and media aspects. To address this, we developed an interactive system called \"Human Nature Test\". In this context, \"human nature\" refers to emotion and consciousness, while \"test\" involves a critical analysis of AI technology and an exploration of the differences between humanity and technicality. Additionally, through experimental research and literature analysis, we found that the integration of electroencephalogram (EEG) data with AI systems is becoming a significant trend. The experiment involved 20 participants, with two conditions: C1 (using EEG data) and C2 (without EEG data). The results indicated a significant increase in immersion under the C1 condition, along with a more positive emotional experience. We summarized three design directions: enhancing immersion, creating emotional experiences, and expressing philosophical concepts. Based on these findings, there is potential for further developing EEG data as a medium to enrich interactive experiences, offering new insights into the fusion of technology and human emotion.",

    "abstract": "Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) based positioning has gained popularity for accurate indoor robot positioning in indoor navigation. In daily life, it is a low-cost solution because Wi-Fi infrastructure is already installed in many indoor areas. In addition, unlike the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Wi-Fi is more suitable for use indoors because signal blocking, attenuation, and reflection restrictions create a unique pattern in places with many Wi-Fi transmitters, and more precise positioning can be performed than GNSS. This paper proposes a machine learning-based method for Wi-Fi-enabled robot positioning in indoor environments. The contributions of this research include comprehensive 3D position estimation, utilization of existing Wi-Fi infrastructure, and a carefully collected dataset for evaluation. The results indicate that the AdaBoost algorithm attains a notable level of accuracy, utilizing the dBm signal strengths from Wi-Fi access points distributed throughout a four-floor building. The mean average error (MAE) values obtained in three axes with the Adaptive Boosting algorithm are 0.044 on the ",

    "abstract": "Pollution can be broadly defined as the presence of contaminants or energy sources detrimental to ecosystems and human health. The human organism serves as a valuable indicator of ecosystem contamination. However, understanding physiological disorders and correlating specific contaminants with disease development is a complex and arduous task, necessitating extensive scientific research spanning years or even decades. To facilitate a more rapid and precise understanding of the physiological impairments induced by various contaminants, a comprehensive approach is indispensable. This review proposes a model for such an approach, which involves the systematic collection and analysis of data from ecosystem contamination monitoring, integrated with biomedical data on compromised physiological conditions in humans across different temporal and spatial scales. Given the complexity and sheer volume of data, alongside the imperative for strategic decision-making, this model leverages the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Although this paper exemplifies the model by investigating the effects of contaminants on the human organism, the model is adaptable to all ecosystem components, thereby supporting the conservation of plant and animal species.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a member of the large coronavirus family with high infectivity and pathogenicity and is the primary pathogen causing the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Phosphorylation is a major type of protein post-translational modification that plays an essential role in the process of SARS-CoV-2-host interactions. The precise identification of phosphorylation sites in host cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 will be of great importance to investigate potential antiviral responses and mechanisms and exploit novel targets for therapeutic development. Numerous computational tools have been developed on the basis of phosphoproteomic data generated by mass spectrometry-based experimental techniques, with which phosphorylation sites can be accurately ascertained across the whole SARS-CoV-2-infected proteomes. In this work, we have comprehensively reviewed several major aspects of the construction strategies and availability of these predictors, including benchmark dataset preparation, feature extraction and refinement methods, machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures, model evaluation approaches and metrics, and publicly available web servers and packages. We have highlighted and compared the prediction performance of each tool on the independent serine/threonine (S/T) and tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation datasets and discussed the overall limitations of current existing predictors. In summary, this review would provide pertinent insights into the exploitation of new powerful phosphorylation site identification tools, facilitate the localization of more suitable target molecules for experimental verification, and contribute to the development of antiviral therapies.",

    "abstract": "The overlapping molecular pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) was analyzed using relationships from a knowledge graph of 33+ million biomedical journal articles. The unsupervised learning rank aggregation algorithm from SemNet 2.0 compared the most important amino acid, peptide, and protein (AAPP) nodes connected to AD, ALS, or FTD. FTD shared 99.9% of its nodes with ALS and AD; AD shared 64.2% of its nodes with FTD and ALS; and ALS shared 68.3% of its nodes with AD and FTD. The results were validated and mapped to functional biological processes using supervised human supervision and an external large language model. The overall percentages of mapped intersecting biological processes were as follows: inflammation and immune response, 19%; synapse and neurotransmission, 19%; cell cycle, 15%; protein aggregation, 12%; membrane regulation, 11%; stress response and regulation, 9%; and gene regulation, 4%. Once normalized for node count, biological mappings for cell cycle regulation and stress response were more prominent in the intersection of AD and FTD. Protein aggregation, gene regulation, and energetics were more prominent in the intersection of ALS and FTD. Synapse and neurotransmission, membrane regulation, and inflammation and immune response were greater at the intersection of AD and ALS. Given the extensive molecular pathophysiology overlap, small differences in regulation, genetic, or environmental factors likely shape the underlying expressed disease phenotype. The results help prioritize testable hypotheses for future clinical or experimental research.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) was applied to nearly all domains of human activity, including scientific research. It is thus warranted to ask whether AI thinking should be durably involved in biomedical research. This problem was addressed by examining three complementary questions (i) What are the major barriers currently met by biomedical investigators? It is suggested that during the last 2 decades there was a shift towards a growing need to elucidate complex systems, and that this was not sufficiently fulfilled by previously successful methods such as theoretical modeling or computer simulation (ii) What is the potential of AI to meet the aforementioned need? it is suggested that recent AI methods are well-suited to perform classification and prediction tasks on multivariate systems, and possibly help in data interpretation, provided their efficiency is properly validated. (iii) Recent representative results obtained with machine learning suggest that AI efficiency may be comparable to that displayed by human operators. It is concluded that AI should durably play an important role in biomedical practice. Also, as already suggested in other scientific domains such as physics, combining AI with conventional methods might generate further progress and new applications, involving heuristic and data interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Intracranial calcifications, particularly within the falx cerebri, serve as crucial diagnostic markers ranging from benign accumulations to signs of severe pathologies. The falx cerebri, a dural fold that separates the cerebral hemispheres, presents challenges in visualization due to its low contrast in standard imaging techniques. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in machine learning and deep learning, have significantly transformed radiological diagnostics. This study aims to explore the application of AI in the segmentation and detection of falx cerebri calcifications using Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images through a comprehensive literature review and a detailed case report. The case report presents a 59-year-old patient diagnosed with falx cerebri calcifications whose CBCT images were analyzed using a cloud-based AI platform, demonstrating effectiveness in segmenting these calcifications, although challenges persist in distinguishing these from other cranial structures. A specific search strategy was employed to search electronic databases, yielding four studies exploring AI-based segmentation of the falx cerebri. The review detailed various AI models and their accuracy across different imaging modalities in identifying and segmenting falx cerebri calcifications, also highlighting the gap in publications in this area. In conclusion, further research is needed to improve AI-driven methods for accurately identifying and measuring intracranial calcifications. Advancing AI applications in radiology, particularly for detecting falx cerebri calcifications, could significantly enhance diagnostic precision, support disease monitoring, and inform treatment planning.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a concept whose goal is to imitate human intellectual activity in computers. It emerged in the 1950s and has gone through three booms. We are in the third boom, and it will continue. Medical applications of AI include diagnosing otitis media from images of the eardrum, often outperforming human doctors. Temporal bone CT and MRI analyses also benefit from AI, with segmentation accuracy improved in anatomically significant structures or diagnostic accuracy improved in conditions such as otosclerosis and vestibular schwannoma. In treatment, AI predicts hearing outcomes for sudden sensorineural hearing loss and post-operative hearing outcomes for patients who have undergone tympanoplasty. AI helps patients with hearing aids hear in challenging situations, such as in noisy environments or when multiple people are speaking. It also provides fitting information to help improve hearing with hearing aids. AI also improves cochlear implant mapping and outcome prediction, even in cases of cochlear malformation. Future trends include generative AI, such as ChatGPT, which can provide medical advice and information, although its reliability and application in clinical settings requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, with increasing incidence. Skin cancer is typically classified as melanoma or non-melanoma skin cancer. Although melanoma is less common than basal or squamous cell carcinomas, it is the deadliest form of cancer, with nearly 8300 Americans expected to die from it each year. Biopsies are currently the gold standard in diagnosing melanoma; however, they can be invasive, expensive, and inaccessible to lower-income individuals. Currently, suspicious lesions are triaged with image-based technologies, such as dermoscopy and confocal microscopy. While these techniques are useful, there is wide inter-user variability and minimal training for dermatology residents on how to properly use these devices. The use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies in dermatology has emerged in recent years to assist in the diagnosis of melanoma that may be more accessible to all patients and more accurate than current methods of screening. This review explores the current status of the application of AI-based algorithms in the detection of melanoma, underscoring its potential to aid dermatologists in clinical practice. We specifically focus on AI application in clinical imaging, dermoscopic evaluation, algorithms that can distinguish melanoma from non-melanoma skin cancers, and in vivo skin imaging devices.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a new hybrid machine learning (ML) model for the early and accurate diagnosis of heart disease. The proposed model is a combination of two powerful ensemble ML models, namely ExtraTreeClassifier (ETC) and XGBoost (XGB), resulting in a hybrid model named ETCXGB. At first, all the features of the utilized heart disease dataset were given as input to the ETC model, which processed it by extracting the predicted probabilities and produced an output. The output of the ETC model was then added to the original feature space by producing an enriched feature matrix, which is then used as input for the XGB model. The new feature matrix is used for training the XGB model, which produces the final result that whether a person has cardiac disease or not, resulting in a high diagnosis accuracy for cardiac disease. In addition to the proposed model, three other hybrid DL models, such as convolutional neural network + recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN), convolutional neural network + long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), and convolutional neural network + bidirectional long short-term memory (CNN-BLSTM), were also investigated. The proposed ETCXGB model improved the prediction accuracy by 3.91%, while CNN-RNN, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-BLSTM enhanced the prediction accuracy by 1.95%, 2.44%, and 2.45%, respectively, for the diagnosis of cardiac disease. The simulation outcomes illustrate that the proposed ETCXGB hybrid ML outperformed the classical ML and DL models in terms of all performance measures. Therefore, using the proposed hybrid ML model for the diagnosis of cardiac disease will help the medical practitioner make an accurate diagnosis of the disease and will help the healthcare society decrease the mortality rate caused by cardiac disease.",

    "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence in orthodontics is emerging as a tool for localizing cephalometric points in two-dimensional X-rays. AI systems are being evaluated for their accuracy and efficiency compared to conventional methods performed by professionals. The main objective of this study is to identify the artificial intelligence algorithms that yield the best results for cephalometric landmark localization, along with their learning system. A literature search was conducted across PubMed-MEDLINE, Cochrane, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science. Observational and experimental studies from 2013 to 2023 assessing the detection of at least 13 cephalometric landmarks in two-dimensional radiographs were included. Studies requiring advanced computer engineering knowledge or involving patients with anomalies, syndromes, or orthodontic appliances, were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) tools. Of 385 references, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria (1 diagnostic accuracy study and 12 retrospective cohorts). Six were high-risk, and seven were low-risk. Convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based AI algorithms showed point localization accuracy ranging from 64.3 to 97.3%, with a mean error of 1.04 mm \u00b1 0.89 to 3.40 mm \u00b1 1.57, within the clinical range of 2 mm. YOLOv3 demonstrated improvements over its earlier version. CNN have proven to be the most effective AI system for detecting cephalometric points in radiographic images. Although CNN-based algorithms generate results very quickly and reproducibly, they still do not achieve the accuracy of orthodontists.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that focuses on designing machines or systems that can perform operations that would typically need human intelligence. AI is a rapidly developing technology that has grabbed the interest of researchers from all across the globe in the healthcare industry. Advancements in machine learning and data analysis have revolutionized oral health diagnosis, treatment, and management, making it a transformative force in healthcare, particularly in dentistry. Particularly in dentistry, AI is becoming increasingly prevalent as it contributes to the diagnosis of oro-facial diseases, offers treatment modalities, and manages practice in the dental operatory. All dental disciplines, including oral medicine, operative dentistry, pediatric dentistry, periodontology, orthodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, prosthodontics, and forensic odontology, have adopted AI. The majority of AI applications in dentistry are for diagnoses based on radiographic or optical images, while other tasks are less applicable due to constraints such as data availability, uniformity, and computational power. Evidence-based dentistry is considered the gold standard for decision making by dental professionals, while AI machine learning models learn from human expertise. Dentistry AI and technology systems can provide numerous benefits, such as improved diagnosis accuracy and increased administrative task efficiency. Dental practices are already implementing various AI applications, such as imaging and diagnosis, treatment planning, robotics and automation, augmented and virtual reality, data analysis and predictive analytics, and administrative support. The dentistry field has extensively used artificial intelligence to assist less-skilled practitioners in reaching a more precise diagnosis. These AI models effectively recognize and classify patients with various oro-facial problems into different risk categories, both individually and on a group basis. The objective of this descriptive review is to review the most recent developments of AI in the field of dentistry.",

    "abstract": "The three-vessel view (3VV) is a standardized transverse scanning plane used in fetal cardiac ultrasound screening to measure the absolute and relative diameters of the pulmonary artery (PA), ascending aorta (Ao), and superior vena cava, as required. The PA/Ao ratio is used to support the diagnosis of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, vascular diameters are measured manually by examiners, which causes intra- and interobserver variability in clinical practice. In the present study, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence-based method for the standardized and quantitative evaluation of 3VV. In total, 315 cases and 20 examiners were included in this study. We used the object-detection software YOLOv7 for the automated extraction of 3VV images and compared three segmentation algorithms: DeepLabv3+, UNet3+, and SegFormer. Using the PA/Ao ratios based on vascular segmentation, YOLOv7 plus UNet3+ yielded the most appropriate classification for normal fetuses and those with CHD. Furthermore, YOLOv7 plus UNet3+ achieved an arithmetic mean value of 0.883 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which was higher than 0.749 for residents and 0.808 for fellows. Our automated method may support unskilled examiners in performing quantitative and objective assessments of 3VV images during fetal cardiac ultrasound screening.",

    "abstract": "Liver disease can significantly impact life expectancy, making early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention critical challenges in medical care. Imaging diagnostics play a crucial role in diagnosing and managing liver diseases. Recently, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging analysis has become indispensable in healthcare. AI, trained on vast datasets of medical images, has sometimes demonstrated diagnostic accuracy that surpasses that of human experts. AI-assisted imaging diagnostics are expected to contribute significantly to the standardization of diagnostic quality. Furthermore, AI has the potential to identify image features that are imperceptible to humans, thereby playing an essential role in clinical decision-making. This capability enables physicians to make more accurate diagnoses and develop effective treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Additionally, AI is anticipated to become a powerful tool in personalized medicine. By integrating individual patient imaging data with clinical information, AI can propose optimal plans for treatment, making it an essential component in the provision of the most appropriate care for each patient. Current reports highlight the advantages of AI in managing liver diseases. As AI technology continues to evolve, it is expected to advance personalized diagnostics and treatments and contribute to overall improvements in healthcare quality.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between emotional intelligence and coping strategies used by adolescents with disabilities, on the one hand to understand how emotional skills influence stress management and everyday challenges and, on the other hand, considering that it could help specialists to develop interventions and educational programs that support the improvement of emotional skills and coping strategies among adolescents with disabilities.\nThis cross-sectional study included 100 Romanian adolescents with neuromotor disabilities aged 13 to 18 years (M = 15.2) divided into three groups according to the stages of adolescence: Group 1 (13 years-46 respondents), Group 2 (14 to 17 years-26 respondents), and Group 3 (18 years-28 respondents). They completed a questionnaire that assessed the emotional intelligence of the adolescents (positive impression, interpersonal, intrapersonal, stress management, adaptability, and general mood) as well as another one that assessed the possible cognitive emotional coping strategies (e.g., \"blame self\", \"acceptance\", \"rumination\", \"positive refocusing\", \"refocus on planning\", \"positive reappraisal\", \"putting into perspective\", \"catastrophizing\", and \"blaming others\") that they may adopt in managing life situations related to their health problem.\nGroup 3 has significantly higher scores than Group 2 on the Interpersonal subscale and also significantly higher scores than Group 1 on the Stress management. Our analysis also revealed significant correlations between adaptive coping strategies and emotional intelligence domains across all groups, with positive associations between acceptance and stress management, as well as between positive refocusing and adaptability. Regression analysis identified adaptive coping strategies as significant predictors of emotional intelligence, explaining 29% of its variance.\nOur findings underscore the critical importance of targeted interventions to enhance emotional regulation and adaptive coping strategies in adolescents with neuromotor disabilities. By focusing on strengthening emotional intelligence and tailoring interventions to developmental stages, these programs can promote better emotional and social functioning, particularly in challenging situations.",

    "abstract": "Despite their diverse assumptions, clinical psychology approaches share the goal of mental health promotion. The literature highlights their usefulness, but also some issues related to their effectiveness, such as their difficulties in monitoring psychological change. The elective strategy for activating and managing psychological change is the clinical question. But how do different types of questions foster psychological change? This work tries to answer this issue by studying therapist-patient interactions with a ML model for text analysis. The goal was to investigate how psychological change occurs thanks to different types of questions, and to see if the ML model recognized this difference in analyzing patients' answers to therapists' clinical questions. The experimental dataset of 14,567 texts was divided based on two different question purposes, splitting answers in two categories: those elicited by questions asking patients to start describing their clinical situation, or those from asking them to detail how they evaluate their situation and mental health condition. The hypothesis that these categories are distinguishable by the model was confirmed by the results, which corroborate the different valences of the questions. These results foreshadow the possibility to train ML and AI models to suggest clinical questions to therapists based on patients' answers, allowing the increase of clinicians' knowledge, techniques, and skills.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) is increasingly recognized as a key factor in healthcare, where managing emotions is vital for job satisfaction, productivity, and interpersonal relationships. For nurses, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, EI plays a pivotal role in navigating emotional challenges and improving their quality of work life (QoWL). This study examined how EI moderates the relationship between nurses' preparedness to care for COVID-19 patients and their QoWL. A cross-sectional, correlational design was used, involving 267 nurses from various healthcare settings. Data were collected through the Emotional Intelligence Scale, the Quality of Nursing Work Life survey, and demographic questionnaires. The sample was predominantly female (94.4%), with a mean age of 37.47 years (SD = 8.09) and an average of 8.43 years of experience (SD = 6.33). Most nurses (87.3%) attended COVID-19-related workshops, with 76.4% feeling prepared to care for COVID-19 patients. Emotional intelligence levels were high, with 93.6% of nurses reporting good personal competence and 85.4% reporting good social competence. Descriptive results showed that 71% of nurses perceived their QoWL as good, while 29% rated it as fair. Pearson correlation analysis revealed significant positive correlations between both personal competence (r = 0.33, ",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver, excluding excessive alcohol consumption and other known causes of liver injury. Animal models are often used to explore different pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets of MASLD. The aim of this study is to apply an artificial intelligence (AI) system based on second-harmonic generation (SHG)/two-photon-excited fluorescence (TPEF) technology to automatically assess the dynamic patterns of hepatic steatosis in MASLD mouse models.\nWe evaluated the characteristics of hepatic steatosis in mouse models of MASLD using AI analysis based on SHG/TPEF images. Six different models of MASLD were induced in C57BL/6 mice by feeding with a western or high-fat diet, with or without fructose in their drinking water, and/or by weekly injections of carbon tetrachloride.\nBody weight, serum lipids, and liver enzyme markers increased at 8 and 16 weeks in each model compared to baseline. Steatosis grade showed a steady upward trend. However, the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network (CRN) histological scoring method detected no significant difference between 8 and 16 weeks. In contrast, AI analysis was able to quantify dynamic changes in the area, number, and size of hepatic steatosis automatically and objectively, making it more suitable for preclinical MASLD animal experiments.\nAI recognition technology may be a new tool for the accurate diagnosis of steatosis in MASLD, providing a more precise and objective method for evaluating steatosis in preclinical murine MASLD models under various experimental and treatment conditions.",

In contrast, AI analysis was able to quantify dynamic changes in the area, number, and size of hepatic steatosis automatically and objectively, making it more suitable for preclinical MASLD animal experiments.",

    "abstract": "To develop an unsupervised artificial intelligence algorithm for identifying and quantifying the presence of false lumen thrombosis (FL) after Frozen Elephant Trunk (FET) operation in computed tomography angiographic (CTA) images in an interdisciplinary approach.\nCTA datasets were retrospectively collected from eight patients after FET operation for aortic dissection from a single center. Of those, five patients had a residual aortic dissection with partial false lumen thrombosis, and three patients had no false lumen or thrombosis. Centerlines of the aortic lumen were defined, and images were calculated perpendicular to the centerline. Lumen and thrombosis were outlined and used as input for a variational autoencoder (VAE) using 2D convolutional neural networks (2D CNN). A 2D latent space was chosen to separate images containing false lumen patency, false lumen thrombosis and no presence of false lumen. Classified images were assigned a thrombus score for the presence or absence of FL thrombosis and an average score for each patient.\nImages reconstructed by the trained 2D CNN VAE corresponded well to original images with thrombosis. Average thrombus scores for the five patients ranged from 0.05 to 0.36 where the highest thrombus scores coincided with the location of the largest thrombus lesion. In the three patients without large thrombus lesions, average thrombus scores ranged from 0.002 to 0.01.\nThe presence and absence of a FL thrombus can be automatically classified by the 2D CNN VAE for patient-specific CTA image datasets. As FL thrombosis is an indication for positive aortic remodeling, evaluation of FL status is essential in follow-up examinations. The presented proof-of-concept is promising for the automated classification and quantification of FL thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Endoscopic assessment for the diagnosis of gastric cancer is limited by interoperator variability and lack of real-time capability. Recently, Raman spectroscopy-based artificial intelligence (AI) has been proposed as a solution to overcome these limitations.\nTo compare the performance of the AI-enabled Raman spectroscopy with that of high-definition white light endoscopy (HD-WLE) for the risk classification of gastric lesions.\nThis was a randomized double-arm feasibility proof-of-concept trial in which participants with suspected gastric neoplasia underwent endoscopic assessment using either the Raman spectroscopy-based AI (SPECTRA IMDx\u2122) or HD-WLE performed by expert endoscopists. Identified lesions were classified in real time as having either low or high risk for neoplasia. Diagnostic outcomes were compared between the two groups using histopathology as the reference.\nA total of 20 patients with 25 lesions were included in the study. SPECTRA, in real-time, performed at a statistically similar level to that of HD-WLE performed by expert endoscopists, achieving an overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100%, 80%, and 89.0%, respectively, by patient; and 100%, 80%, and 92%, respectively, by lesion, while expert endoscopists using HD-WLE attained a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100%, 80%, and 90%, respectively, by patient; and 100%, 83.3%, and 91.7%, respectively, by lesion, in differentiating high-risk from low-risk gastric lesions.\nThe SPECTRA's comparable performance with that of HD-WLE suggests that it can potentially be a valuable adjunct for less experienced endoscopists to attain accurate and real-time diagnoses of gastric lesions. Larger-scale prospective randomized trials are recommended to validate these promising results further.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in neuroimaging, particularly diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET), have significantly enhanced the early detection of biomarkers in neurodegenerative and neuro-ophthalmic disorders. These include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease. This review highlights the transformative role of advanced diffusion MRI techniques-Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging-in identifying subtle microstructural changes in the brain and visual pathways that precede clinical symptoms. When integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, these techniques achieve unprecedented diagnostic precision, facilitating early detection of neurodegeneration and inflammation. Additionally, next-generation PET tracers targeting misfolded proteins, such as tau and alpha-synuclein, along with inflammatory markers, enhance the visualization and quantification of pathological processes in vivo. Deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks and multimodal transformers, further improve diagnostic accuracy by integrating multimodal imaging data and predicting disease progression. Despite challenges such as technical variability, data privacy concerns, and regulatory barriers, the potential of AI-enhanced neuroimaging to revolutionize early diagnosis and personalized treatment in neurodegenerative and neuro-ophthalmic disorders is immense. This review underscores the importance of ongoing efforts to validate, standardize, and implement these technologies to maximize their clinical impact.",

    "abstract": "This perspective paper explores the untapped potential of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning-based dimension reduction techniques in multimodal neuroimaging analysis of Long COVID fatigue. The complexity and high dimensionality of neuroimaging data from modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pose significant analytical challenges. Deep neural networks and other machine learning approaches offer powerful tools for managing this complexity and extracting meaningful patterns. The paper discusses current challenges in neuroimaging data analysis, reviews state-of-the-art AI approaches for dimension reduction and multimodal integration, and examines their potential applications in Long COVID research. Key areas of focus include the development of AI-based biomarkers, AI-informed treatment strategies, and personalized medicine approaches. The authors argue that AI-driven multimodal neuroimaging analysis represents a paradigm shift in studying complex brain disorders like Long COVID. While acknowledging technical and ethical challenges, the paper emphasizes the potential of these advanced techniques to uncover new insights into the condition, which might lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for those affected by Long COVID fatigue. The broader implications for understanding and treating other complex neurological and psychiatric conditions are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) effectively diagnoses malignant and pre-malignant gastrointestinal lesions. In the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising results in enhancing EUS sensitivity and accuracy, particularly for subepithelial lesions (SELs) like gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Furthermore, AI models have shown high accuracy in predicting malignancy in gastric GISTs and distinguishing between benign and malignant intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). The utility of AI has also been applied to existing and emerging technologies involved in the performance and evaluation of EUS-guided biopsies. These advancements may improve training in EUS, allowing trainees to focus on technical skills and image interpretation. This review evaluates the current state of AI in EUS, covering imaging diagnosis, EUS-guided biopsies, and training advancements. It discusses early feasibility studies and recent developments, while also addressing the limitations and challenges. This article aims to review AI applications to EUS and its applications in clinical practice while addressing pitfalls and challenges.",

    "abstract": "Nurses are frontline caregivers who handle heavy workloads and high-stakes activities. They face several mental health issues, including stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression. The welfare of nurses and the standard of patient treatment depends on resolving this problem. Artificial intelligence is revolutionising healthcare, and its integration provides many possibilities in addressing these concerns. This review examines literature published over the past 40 years, concentrating on AI integration in nursing for mental health support, improved patient care, and ethical issues. Using databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, a thorough search was conducted with Boolean operators, narrowing results for relevance. Critically examined were publications on artificial intelligence applications in patient care ethics, mental health, and nursing and mental health. The literature examination revealed that, by automating repetitive chores and improving workload management, artificial intelligence (AI) can relieve mental health challenges faced by nurses and improve patient care. Practical implications highlight the requirement of using rigorous implementation strategies that address ethical issues, data privacy, and human-centred decision-making. All changes must direct the integration of artificial intelligence in nursing to guarantee its sustained and significant influence on healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping healthcare, offering transformative potential for diagnostics, treatment, and patient management. Despite its growing significance, there is limited integration of AI education in medical curricula, raising concerns about the readiness of future healthcare professionals to utilize AI technologies. This study aims to evaluate the readiness of medical students in Saudi Arabia to embrace AI and to assess the current state of AI education, AI Application use, and future perspectives for medical students.\na cross-sectional design was employed. It involved medical students from various regions of Saudi Arabia. Data were collected using an anonymous, online, structured, and validated tool from previous studies. The survey included sociodemographic information, details on AI education, the usage of AI applications, intended specialties, and a Medical Artificial Intelligence Readiness Scale for Medical Students (MAIRS-MS). The data were extracted and revised in an Excel sheet. Statistical analysis was conducted using the IBM SPSS computer program with appropriate statistical tests.\nThis study enrolled 572 medical students, with a mean age of 21.93 years. Most students were Saudi (99.0%), and 43.7% lived in the western region of Saudi Arabia. Most students attended a government medical college (97.41%), and 64.3% of students were in their clinical years. Only 14.5% of the students had received formal AI education, while 34.3% had participated in extracurricular AI training. The mean (SD) MAIRS-MS score was 68.39 (18.3), with higher scores associated with female students, those from the central region, and those with advanced English and computer technology skills (\nthere is limited AI education and moderate AI readiness among medical students in Saudi colleges, with significant variability in terms of gender, region, and educational background. These findings underscore the need to integrate AI education into medical curricula to better prepare future physicians for AI-enabled healthcare systems.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into in vitro fertilization (IVF) laboratories signifies a significant advancement in reproductive medicine. AI technologies, such as neural networks, deep learning, and machine learning, promise to enhance quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) through increased accuracy, consistency, and operational efficiency. This comprehensive review examines the effects of AI on IVF laboratories, focusing on its role in automating processes such as embryo and sperm selection, optimizing clinical outcomes, and reducing human error. AI's data analysis and pattern recognition capabilities offer valuable predictive insights, enhancing personalized treatment plans and increasing success rates in fertility treatments. However, integrating AI also brings ethical, regulatory, and societal challenges, including concerns about data security, algorithmic bias, and the human-machine interface in clinical decision-making. Through an in-depth examination of current case studies, advancements, and future directions, this manuscript highlights how AI can revolutionize IVF by standardizing processes, improving patient outcomes, and advancing the precision of reproductive medicine. It underscores the necessity of ongoing research and ethical oversight to ensure fair and transparent applications in this sensitive field, assuring the responsible use of AI in reproductive medicine.",

    "abstract": "Post-stroke dysphagia is highly prevalent and causes complication. While video games have demonstrated potential to increase patient engagement in rehabilitation, their efficacy in stroke patients with dysphagia remains unclear. This aim of this study was to explore the effectiveness of the artificial intelligence-based video-game (AI-VG) intervention in improving swallowing function among stroke patients with dysphagia.\nA prospective, single blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in a rehabilitation hospital from October 2023 to July 2024. Participants were randomly assigned to either the AI-VG system group or the usual care group. All participants received training for 30\u00a0min per session per day, five times per week for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was change in swallowing function from baseline (T0) to post-intervention (T1) and 1 month follow-up (T2). Secondary outcomes included changes in laryngeal function, oral intake function, nutritional status, and swallowing-related quality of life. The adherence, satisfaction, and acceptance of the two groups were evaluated. Changes in outcomes over time were compared using generalized estimating equation modeling.\nA total of 84 participants (AI-VG group\u00a0=\u00a042, age\u00a0=\u00a065.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.70 years, 57.10\u00a0% male; usual care group\u00a0=\u00a042, age\u00a0=\u00a066.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.10 years, 69.00\u00a0% male) were included in this study. Compared with the usual care group, the AI-VG group showed significantly improved swallowing function, with a mean group difference of 4.02 (95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0from\u00a0-6.16 to\u00a0-1.89, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) at T1 and 4.14 (95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0from\u00a0-6.16 to 2.12, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) at T2. Oral intake function, nutritional status, and swallowing-related quality of life improved significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for overall group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction). Adherence was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (median [IQR], 18.00 [17.00-20.00] vs. 16.00 [15.00-17.00], P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The intervention group had higher levels of acceptance and satisfaction of AI-VG (103.00 [100.50-104.00] and 73.00 [72.00-74.00], respectively). No significant difference was observed in laryngeal function (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05).\nThe AI-VG intervention is an effective method for enhancing swallowing function in patients with post-stroke dysphagia. Future validation through multicenter, large-sample RCTs are warranted to confirm the findings and explore broader clinical applications.\nClinicalTrials.

    "abstract": "One of the foremost causes of global healthcare burden is cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. The medical records, lab results, radiographs, endoscopic images, tissue samples, and medical histories of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies provide an enormous amount of medical data. There are encouraging signs that the advent of artificial intelligence could enhance the treatment of gastrointestinal issues with this data. Deep learning algorithms can swiftly and effectively analyze unstructured, high-dimensional data, including texts, images, and waveforms, while advanced machine learning approaches could reveal new insights into disease risk factors and phenotypes. In summary, artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize various features of gastrointestinal cancer care, such as early detection, diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis. This paper highlights some of the many potential applications of artificial intelligence in this domain. Additionally, we discuss the present state of the discipline and its potential future developments.",

    "abstract": "Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) is a transformative surgical intervention for hip joint disorders, necessitating meticulous preoperative planning for optimal outcomes. With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), preoperative planning paradigms have evolved, leveraging AI algorithms for enhanced decision support and imaging analysis. This systematic review aims to comprehensively evaluate the role of AI in THA preoperative planning, synthesizing evidence from studies exploring various AI techniques and their applications.\nA systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted to identify relevant articles. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies focusing on AI in THA preoperative planning, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and comparative studies.\nSix studies from China met the inclusion criteria, collectively analyzing 831 patients. AI-assisted planning demonstrated superior accuracy in estimating prosthesis size and positioning compared to traditional methods. However, limitations such as geographic bias and language constraints were noted.\nAI-assisted preoperative planning significantly enhances femoral positioning accuracy, providing superior outcomes compared to traditional methods. This improvement in precision, particularly in the placement of femoral and acetabular components, has been consistently observed across studies, making AI an indispensable tool in improving the overall success of Total Hip Arthroplasty. Despite promising findings, further research is warranted to address limitations and optimize the integration of AI technologies into routine clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Giant cell arteritis (GCA), a systemic vasculitis affecting large and medium-sized arteries, poses significant diagnostic and management challenges, particularly in preventing irreversible complications like vision loss. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), offer promising solutions to enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize treatment strategies for GCA. This systematic review, conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, synthesizes existing literature on AI applications in GCA care, with a focus on diagnostic accuracy, treatment outcomes, and predictive modeling. A comprehensive search of databases (MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science) from their inception to September 2024 identified 309 studies, with four meeting inclusion criteria. The review highlights the potential of AI to improve diagnostic accuracy through image analysis of color Doppler ultrasound and clinical data, with AI models like random forests, convolutional neural networks, and logistic regression demonstrating effectiveness in predicting GCA diagnosis and relapse after glucocorticoid tapering. Despite these promising findings, challenges such as the need for larger datasets, prospective validation, and addressing ethical concerns remain. The review underscores the transformative potential of AI in GCA care while emphasizing the need for further research to refine and validate AI-driven tools for broader clinical implementation.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionised numerous aspects of our daily lives, with profound implications across various sectors, including healthcare. Although the concept of AI in healthcare was introduced in the early 1970s, the integration of this technology in healthcare is still in the evolution phase. Despite barriers, the current decade is witnessing an increased utility of AI into diverse specialities of the medical field to enhance precision medicine, predict diagnosis, therapeutic results, and prognosis; this includes respiratory medicine, critical care, and in their allied specialties. AI algorithms are widely studied in areas like mechanical ventilation, sleep medicine, lung ultrasound, and pulmonary function diagnostics and the results are found to be promising. The quality of patient care and safety can be greatly enhanced if respiratory care professionals fully understand the concept and importance of AI, as they are already incorporating various aspects of this technology into their clinical practice. Awareness of AI in the clinical field is essential during this phase; hence, it is desirable to establish widely accepted standards presented in a clear and accessible language. This article aims to describe the existing and prospective role of AI in the field of respiratory care and allied areas.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted various fields, including oncology. This comprehensive review examines the current applications and future prospects of AI in lung cancer research and treatment. We critically analyze the latest AI technologies and their applications across multiple domains, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, immunomics, microbiomics, radiomics, and pathomics in lung cancer research. The review elucidates AI's transformative role in enhancing early detection, personalizing treatment strategies, and accelerating therapeutic innovations. We explore AI's impact on precision medicine in lung cancer, encompassing early diagnosis, treatment planning, monitoring, and drug discovery. The potential of AI in analyzing complex datasets, including genetic profiles, imaging data, and clinical records, is discussed, highlighting its capacity to provide more accurate diagnoses and tailored treatment plans. Additionally, we examine AI's potential in predicting patient responses to immunotherapy and forecasting survival rates, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The review addresses technical challenges facing AI implementation in lung cancer care, including data quality and quantity issues, model interpretability, and ethical considerations, while discussing potential solutions and emphasizing the importance of rigorous validation. By providing a comprehensive analysis for researchers and clinicians, this review underscores AI's indispensable role in combating lung cancer and its potential to usher in a new era of medical breakthroughs, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) beginning to integrate in healthcare, is ushering in a transformative era, impacting diagnostics, altering personalized treatment, and significantly improving operational efficiency. The study aims to describe AI in healthcare, including important technologies like robotics, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP), and to investigate how these technologies are used in patient interaction, predictive analytics, and remote monitoring. The goal of this review is to present a thorough analysis of AI's effects on healthcare while providing stakeholders with a road map for navigating this changing environment.\nThis review analyzes the impact of AI on healthcare using data from the Web of Science (2014-2024), focusing on keywords like AI, ML, and healthcare applications. It examines the uses and effects of AI on healthcare by synthesizing recent literature and real-world case studies, such as Google Health and IBM Watson Health, highlighting AI technologies, their useful applications, and the difficulties in putting them into practice, including problems with data security and resource limitations. The review also discusses new developments in AI, and how they can affect society.\nThe findings demonstrate how AI is enhancing the skills of medical professionals, enhancing diagnosis, and opening the door to more individualized treatment plans, as reflected in the steady rise of AI-related healthcare publications from 158 articles (3.54%) in 2014 to 731 articles (16.33%) by 2024. Core applications like remote monitoring and predictive analytics improve operational effectiveness and patient involvement. However, there are major obstacles to the mainstream implementation of AI in healthcare, including issues with data security and budget constraints.\nHealthcare may be transformed by AI, but its successful use requires ethical and responsible use. To meet the changing demands of the healthcare sector and guarantee the responsible application of AI technologies, the evaluation highlights the necessity of ongoing research, instruction, and multidisciplinary cooperation. In the future, integrating AI responsibly will be essential to optimizing its advantages and reducing related dangers.",

    "abstract": "Ambient artificial intelligence offers promise for improving documentation efficiency and reducing provider burden through clinical note generation. However, challenges persist in workflow integration, compliance, and widespread adoption. This study leveraged a Learning Health System (LHS) framework to align research and operations using a hybrid effectiveness-implementation protocol, embedded as pragmatic trial operations within the electronic health record (EHR).\nAn alpha phase was conducted to pilot technical integration, refine workflows, and determine sample size in planning for a beta phase designed as a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index (PFI) as primary outcome. During alpha, bi-directional governance was established between IS operations and LHS team with multidisciplinary workgroups for analytics, technical, documentation, and user experience. Ambient AI was embedded into the EHR using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), with real-time data dashboards tracking utilization and documentation accuracy for operations and research. Performance metrics were monitored serially using a difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis to detect drift caused by software workflow changes.\nThe alpha phase, designed as Type 1 Hybrid, informed a 24-week beta phase stepped-wedge trial with 90% power to detect changes in PFI. Across the alpha phase, the weighted median of average provider Ambient AI utilization was 65.4% following Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles addressing organizational feasibility and task-dependent adoption. Diagnosis code accuracy dropped from 79% to 35% (p < 0.01) during alpha but recovered with a new note template and provider training. DiD did not detect significant drifts in work outside of work or time in notes two weeks before and after the new note template. Beta phase enrollment achieved its targeted 66 providers across eight specialties, initiating on schedule.\nWe provide a novel playbook for integrating Generative AI platforms in healthcare, combining pragmatic trial operations, human-centered design, and real-time monitoring to advance evidence-based implementation.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) falls within the spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating diseases that may lead to permanent neurological disability. Fundamental to the diagnosis and clinical surveillance is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that allows for the identification of T2-hyperintensities associated with autoimmune injury that demonstrate distinct spatial distribution patterns. Here, we describe the clinical experience of a 31-year-old, right-handed, White man seen in consultation at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, following complaints of headaches that began after head trauma related to military service. Imaging data spanning over 10\u00a0years are provided. All MRI data are currently presented in black and white with grayscale values within voxels associated with a single variable, intensity. We transformed these grayscale values into color using generative artificial intelligence (AI). As color allows for the inclusion of three variables: hue, lightness (intensity), and saturation, we hypothesized that additional details may be learned beyond those currently provided with the existing conventional approach of grayscale interpretation. We identified differences in lesion colors that remained consistent from the two MRI timepoints studied. In addition, quantitative R1, R2, and proton density voxel values appeared consistent with the color scheme generated by the AI system. With advancing AI methods and capabilities along with the additional data that color provides in comparison to grayscale, new insights into the biology of disease may be possible. Modifying what we measure in people with chronic conditions and how we present the data may be of greater value than conventional approaches typically used in the study, education, and care of people with MS and other neurological conditions.\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune condition involving the brain and spinal cord that may result in permanent neurological disability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are used both in the diagnosis and surveillance of people with MS. Current MRI data appear black and white in appearance and grayscale values within voxels comprise the images that are seen. However, grayscale values are associated with a single variable, intensity. On the other hand, color is associated with three variables: hue, lightness (intensity), and saturation. Overall, grayscale images are less dynamic and, more importantly, they may exclude existing details. We hypothesized that the transformation from grayscale MRI data to color may provide additional information related to lesions resulting from MS. We were able to identify color differences in lesions when evaluating MRI images from a single subject. These color changes appeared to remain consistent over the course of 10\u00a0years. Quantitative MRI values also suggested a relationship between degree of brain injury within lesions by color. With advancing artificial intelligence methods and capabilities along with the addition of color information, more could be learned about the biology of MS. The information provided here suggests that the use of color may have value in neuroimaging. Adjusting what we measure for those within chronic conditions and how the information is presented may be of greater value than current practices and may enhance the study, education, and delivery of care for those with chronic neurological conditions.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to conduct a scoping and bibliometric review of articles using artificial intelligence (AI) in tennis. The analysis covered various aspects of tennis, including performance, health, match results, physiological data, tennis expenditure, and prize amounts. Articles on AI in tennis published until 2024 were retrieved from the Web of Science database. A total of 389 records were screened, and 108 articles were retained for analysis. The analysis identified intermittent gaps in publication output during certain intervals, notably in the years 2007-2008 and 2012-2013. From 2012 onward, there was a clear upward trend in publications and citations, peaking in 2022. The theme was led by China, the United States, and Australia. These countries maintain their status as the top contributors in terms of publications. The analysis of author collaborations revealed multiple clusters, with notable contributions from researchers in China, Australia, Japan, and the United States. This bibliometric review has elucidated the evolution of AI research in tennis, highlighting the countries and authors that have significantly contributed to this field over the years. The prediction model suggests that the number of articles and citations on this topic will continue to increase over the next decade (until 2034).",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease is characterised by the progressive loss of kidney function. However, predicting who will progress to kidney failure is difficult. Artificial Intelligence, including Machine Learning, shows promise in this area. This narrative review highlights the most common and important variables used in machine learning models to predict progressive chronic kidney disease. Ovid Medline and EMBASE were searched in August 2023 with keywords relating to 'chronic kidney disease', 'machine learning', and 'end-stage renal disease'. Studies were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria and excluded if variables inputted into machine learning models were not discussed. Data extraction focused on specific variables inputted into the machine learning models. After screening of 595 articles, 16 were included in the review. The most utilised machine learning models were random forest, support vector machines and XGBoost. The most commonly occurring variables were age, gender, measures of renal function, measures of proteinuria, and full blood examination. Only half of all studies included clinical variables in their models. The most important variables overall were measures of renal function, measures of proteinuria, age, full blood examination and serum albumin. Machine learning was consistently superior or non-inferior when compared to the Kidney Failure Risk Equation. This review identified key variables used in machine learning models to predict chronic kidney disease progression to kidney failure. These findings lay the foundations for the development of future machine learning models capable of rivalling the Kidney Failure Risk Equation in the provision of accurate kidney failure prediction.",

    "abstract": "This study explores how corporate social responsibility (CSR) and artificial intelligence (AI) can be combined in the healthcare industry during the post-COVID-19 recovery phase. The aim is to showcase how this fusion can help tackle healthcare inequalities, enhance accessibility and support long-term sustainability.\nAdopting a viewpoint approach, the study leverages existing literature and case studies to analyze the intersection of CSR and AI. It investigates AI's capabilities in predictive analytics, telemedicine and resource management within the framework of CSR principles.\nIntegrating AI and CSR can profoundly enhance healthcare delivery by ensuring equitable access, optimizing resource allocation and fostering trust through transparency and ethical standards. This synergy benefits public health and enhances the corporate image and long-term viability of healthcare organizations.\nThe study is conceptual and relies on existing literature and case studies. Future research should empirically test the proposed models and frameworks in diverse healthcare settings to validate and refine these insights.\nThe insights from this study can be directly applied by healthcare organizations to develop policies and practices that integrate AI and CSR. This integration can promote ethical standards, enhance operational efficiency and, most importantly, improve patient outcomes.\nIntegrating AI and CSR in the healthcare sector carries consequences. It plays a role in promoting fairness among patients, bridging gaps in healthcare services, and boosting trust and independence through the clear and responsible use of AI technologies. This highlights the groundbreaking impact of this research within the healthcare industry.\nThis paper offers a viewpoint perspective on the strategic alignment of AI and CSR, presenting a novel approach to creating resilient healthcare systems in the post-COVID-19 era. It provides healthcare managers and policymakers with valuable insights on leveraging AI within CSR frameworks to achieve sustainable healthcare solutions, thereby contributing significantly to the field.",

    "abstract": "Devices that help educate young doctors and enable safe, minimally invasive surgery are needed. Eureka is a surgical artificial intelligence (AI) system that can intraoperatively highlight loose connective tissues (LCTs) in the dissected layers and nerves in the surgical field displayed on a monitor. In this study, we examined whether AI navigation (AIN) with Eureka can assist trainees in recognizing nerves during colorectal surgery.\nIn left-sided colorectal surgery (n\u2009=\u200951, between\u00a0July 2023 and February 2024), Eureka was connected to the laparoscopic system side by side, and the nerve was highlighted on the monitor during the surgery. We examined the rate of failure to recognize nerves by trainee surgeons over a total of 101 scenarios after it was recognized intraoperatively by the supervising surgeon (certified by the Japanese Society of Endoscopic Surgery). We also examined the frequency of nerve recognition by the trainee physicians viewing the Eureka monitor when recognition was not possible (recognition assistance rate).\nThe nerve recognition failure rate and recognition assistance rate with AIN were as follows: right hypogastric nerve during sigmoid colon mobilization, 44/101 (43.6%) and 19/44 (43.2%); left hypogastric nerves during dissection of the dorsal rectum, 27/101 (26.7%) and 13/27 (48.1%); right lumbar splanchnic nerves, 32/101 (31.7%) and 29/32 (90.6%); left lumbar splanchnic nerves, 44/101 (43.6%) and 39/44 (88.6%); and pelvic visceral nerves during dissection of the dorsal rectum, 29/45 (64.4%) and 6/29 (20.7%), respectively.\nAlthough the rate of recognition with assistance from AIN differed for the different nerves, this system can potentially assist in anatomic recognition, enhance surgical education, and contribute to nerve preservation.\nImprovement of AI navigation in minimally invasive surgery and examination of its intraoperative support and educational effectiveness.

    "abstract": "The ability to non-invasively measure left atrial pressure would facilitate the identification of patients at risk of pulmonary congestion and guide proactive heart failure care. Wearable cardiac monitors, which record single-lead electrocardiogram data, provide information that can be leveraged to infer left atrial pressures.\nWe developed a deep neural network using single-lead electrocardiogram data to determine when the left atrial pressure is elevated. The model was developed and internally evaluated using a cohort of 6739 samples from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and externally validated on a cohort of 4620 samples from a second institution. We then evaluated model on patch-monitor electrocardiographic data on a small prospective cohort.\nThe model achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 for detecting elevated left atrial pressures on an internal holdout dataset from MGH and 0.76 on an external validation set from a second institution. A further prospective dataset was obtained using single-lead electrocardiogram data with a patch-monitor from patients who underwent right heart catheterization at MGH. Evaluation of the model on this dataset yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.875 for identifying elevated left atrial pressures for electrocardiogram signals acquired close to the time of the right heart catheterization procedure.\nThese results demonstrate the utility and the potential of ambulatory cardiac hemodynamic monitoring with electrocardiogram patch-monitors.\nHeart failure is a common disorder that is challenging to manage. Appearance of symptoms can be subtle and dangerous and there are few tools for clinicians to estimate when a patient is likely to experience an episode of heart failure. Current methods to detect elevated pressure in the heart (one sign of oncoming failure) are invasive and can only be performed in an inpatient setting. A non-invasive, quick method for detecting higher heart pressure would be helpful for identifying worsening heart failure in the home environment. For this reason, we developed a computer method to detect elevated pressures inside the heart using a non-invasive signal from a wearable patch monitor device, the electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG). Our results show our method provides a reliable, non-invasive way to measure heart pressures using data that can be obtained in the outpatient setting.",

    "abstract": "A scoping review was conducted to investigate the role of radiological imaging, particularly high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosing and prognosticating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Relevant studies from the PubMed database were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two reviewers assessed study quality and analyzed data, estimating heterogeneity and publication bias. The analysis primarily focused on deep learning approaches for feature extraction from HRCT images, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Radiomics, utilizing quantitative features extracted from images, were computed using various tools to improve precision in analysis. Validation methods such as k-fold cross-validation were employed to assess model robustness and generalizability. Findings revealed that radiologic patterns in interstitial lung disease hold prognostic significance for patient survival. However, the additional prognostic value of quantitative assessment of fibrosis extent remains uncertain. IPF poses a substantial challenge in respiratory medicine, necessitating advanced diagnostic and prognostic tools. Radiomics emerges as a valuable asset, offering insights into disease characteristics and aiding in disease classification. It contributes to understanding underlying pathophysiological processes, facilitating more effective management of pulmonary disorders. Future research should focus on clarifying the additional prognostic value of quantitative assessment and further refining AI-based diagnostic and prognostic models for IPF.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, access to large-scale bilingual parallel data has become more efficient, thereby accelerating the development and application of machine translation. Given the increasing cultural exchanges between China and Japan, many scholars have begun to study the Chinese translation of Japanese waka poetry. Based on this, the study first explores the structure of waka and the current state of its Chinese translations, analyzing existing translation disputes and introducing a data collection method for waka using IoT. Then, an optimized neural machine translation model is proposed, which integrates a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network, vertical Tree-LSTM, and an attention mechanism into the Transformer framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the three optimized models-Transformer\u2009+\u2009Bi-LSTM, Transformer\u2009+\u2009Tree-LSTM, and Transformer\u2009+\u2009Tree-LSTM\u2009+\u2009Attention-outperform the baseline Transformer model on both public and waka datasets. The BLEU scores of the models on the public dataset were 23.71, 23.95, and 24.12, respectively. Notably, on the waka dataset, the Transformer\u2009+\u2009Tree-LSTM\u2009+\u2009Attention model achieved the highest BLEU score of 20.65, demonstrating a significant advantage in capturing waka's unique features and contextual information. This study offers new methods to enhance the quality of Chinese-Japanese translation, promoting cultural exchange and understanding.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of the employment situation on the anxiety levels and research self-efficacy of graduate students, with a particular focus on female graduate students. The study aims to understand how the use of AIGC tools, which has become more frequent among those with lower research self-efficacy, affects anxiety and research resilience. Additionally, the research explores the role of the mentoring relationship in influencing the psychological and academic experiences of female graduate students.\nThe research involved 1164 female master's and doctoral students and employed a moderated chain mediation model. This model was constructed based on social cognitive theory and Habermas interaction theory to analyze the relationships between research self-efficacy, mobile phone dependence, anxiety, and research resilience. Data was collected and empirically analyzed using SPSS 26.0, a statistical software, to examine the proposed relationships and the moderating effect of the mentoring relationship.\nThe findings revealed that scientific research self-efficacy positively influences research resilience among female graduate students. Additionally, mobile phone dependence and anxiety were found to play a chain mediating role between self-efficacy and research resilience. The study also discovered that the mentoring relationship negatively moderated the effects of mobile phone dependence and anxiety on these students.\nBased on the results, the study concludes that mentors and academic administrators should consider the research capabilities and interests of students when assigning research tasks. It is recommended to establish a flight instructor mentorship system that maximizes the strengths of each mentor to support students, especially those with suboptimal mentor-mentee relationships. This approach could help in providing positive guidance and improving the research resilience of female graduate students who are more susceptible to anxiety and mobile phone dependence.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the use of machine learning (ML) models to predict the biodistribution of nanoparticles in various organs, using a dataset derived from research on nanoparticle behavior for cancer treatment. The dataset includes both categorical and numerical variables related to nanoparticle properties, with a focus on their distribution across organs such as the tumor, heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney tissues. In order to address the complex and non-linear nature of the data, three machine learning models were utilized: Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR), Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The selection of these models was based on their wide range of capabilities in dealing with non-linear relationships and data complexity. To further model performance and strength, the study also applied cutting-edge methods including the Firefly Algorithm for hyperparameter tuning and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection. Based on higher R\u00b2 and lower RMSE values for most output parameters, the study concluded that Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) did better compared to other models in predicting biodistribution outcomes. The study revealed that machine learning models, particularly KRR, exhibit a high level of efficiency in accurately representing the non-linear characteristics of nanoparticle biodistribution. The results obtained provide valuable insights into the optimization of predictive models for the behavior of nanoparticles. These models can be further enhanced by the use of advanced feature selection and hyperparameter tuning techniques.",

    "abstract": "In clinical practice, differentiating among pulmonary mucormycosis (PM), invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) can be challenging. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of chest CT-based artificial intelligence (AI) models in distinguishing among these three diseases. Patients with confirmed PM, IPA, or PTB were retrospectively recruited from three tertiary hospitals. Two models were developed: unanotated supervised training (UST) model trained with original CT images and annotated supervised training (AST) model trained with manually annotated lesion images. A network questionnaire with 20 cases was designed to assess the performance of clinicians. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated for both models and clinicians. A total of 61 PM cases, 136 IPA cases, and 155 PTB cases were included in the study. In the internal validation set, both models had an accuracy of 66.1%. The UST model had sensitivities of 27.3%, 73.9%, and 76.0% for PM, IPA, and PTB, while AST model had sensitivities of 9.1%, 69.6%, and 88.0% for the same conditions. In the external validation set, both models had an accuracy of 57.6%. The UST model had sensitivities of 0, 85.7%, and 53.3% for PM, IPA, and PTB, respectively, while AST model had sensitivities of 0, 42.9% and 83.3%. 112 clinicians had an accuracy of 42.9%, with sensitivities of 31.5%, 43.4%, and 48.0% for PM, IPA, and PTB. We demonstrated that two AI models showed comparable performance in diagnosing three diseases. Both models achieved acceptable sensitivity in detecting IPA and PTB, but had low sensitivity in identifying PM.\nThis study assessed two AI models' ability to distinguish between three lung infections using chest CT scans. Both models showed good sensitivity for detecting invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and pulmonary tuberculosis but struggled with identifying pulmonary mucormycosis.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) tools for histological diagnosis offer great potential to healthcare, yet failure to understand their clinical context is delaying adoption. IGUANA (Interpretable Gland-Graphs using a Neural Aggregator) is an AI algorithm that can effectively classify colonic biopsies into normal versus abnormal categories, designed to automatically report normal cases. We performed a retrospective pathological and clinical review of the errors made by IGUANA.\nFalse negative (FN) errors were the primary focus due to the greatest propensity for harm. Pathological evaluation involved assessment of whole slide image (WSI) quality, precise diagnoses for each missed entity and identification of factors impeding diagnosis. Clinical evaluation scored the impact of each error on the patient and detailed the type of impact in terms of missed diagnosis, investigations or treatment.\nAcross 5054 WSIs from 2080 UK National Health Service patients there were 220 FN errors across 164 cases (4.4% of WSI, 7.9% of cases). Diagnostic errors varied from cases of adenocarcinoma to mild inflammation. 88.4% of FN errors would have no impact on patient care, with only one error causing major patient harm. Factors that protected against harm included biopsies being low-risk polyps or diagnostic features were detected in other biopsies.\nMost FN errors would not result in patient harm, suggesting that even with a 7.9% case-level error rate, this AI tool might be more suitable for adoption than statistics portray. Consideration of the clinical context of AI tool errors is essential to facilitate safe implementation.",

Healthcare organizations are now starting to establish management strategies for integrating such platforms (AI-ML toolsets) which leverage the computational power of advanced algorithms to analyze data and to provide better insights which ultimately translates to enhanced clinical decision-making and improved patient outcomes. Emerging AI-ML platforms and trends in pathology and medicine are reshaping the field by offering innovative solutions to enhance diagnostic accuracy, operational workflows, clinical decision support, and clinical outcomes. These tools are also increasingly valuable in pathology research where they contribute to automated image analysis, biomarker discovery, drug development, clinical trials, and productive analytics. Other related trends include the adoption of ML-Ops (Machine Learning Operations) for managing models in clinical settings, the application of multimodal and multi-agent AI to utilize diverse data sources, expedited translational research and virtualized education for training and simulation. As the final chapter of our AI educational series, this review article delves into the current adoption, future directions, and transformative potential of AI-ML platforms in pathology and medicine, discussing their applications, benefits, challenges, and future perspectives.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic emergent disease multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) following coronavirus disease-19 infection can mimic endemic typhus. We aimed to use artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a clinical decision support system that accurately distinguishes MIS-C versus Endemic Typhus (MET).\nDemographic, clinical, and laboratory features rapidly available following presentation were extracted for 133 patients with MIS-C and 87 patients hospitalized due to typhus. An attention module assigned importance to inputs used to create the two-phase AI-MET. Phase 1 uses 17 features to arrive at a classification manually (MET-17). If the confidence level is not surpassed, 13 additional features are added to calculate MET-30 using a recurrent neural network.\nWhile 24 of 30 features differed statistically, the values overlapped sufficiently that the features were clinically irrelevant distinguishers as individual parameters. However, AI-MET successfully classified typhus and MIS-C with 100% accuracy. A validation cohort of 111 additional patients with MIS-C was classified with 99% accuracy.\nArtificial intelligence can successfully distinguish MIS-C from typhus using rapidly available features. This decision support system will be a valuable tool for front-line providers facing the difficulty of diagnosing a febrile child in endemic areas.",

    "abstract": "Solid organ transplantation (SOT) is vital for end-stage organ failure but faces challenges like organ shortage and rejection. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential to improve outcomes through better matching, success prediction, and automation. However, the evolution of AI in SOT research remains underexplored. This study uses bibliometric analysis to identify trends, hotspots, and key contributors in the field.\n821 articles from the Web of Science Core Collection were exported for analysis. Microsoft Excel 2021 was used for descriptive statistics. VOSviewer, CiteSpace, Scimago Graphica, and Biblioshiny were used for bibliometric analysis. The ggalluvial package in R was utilized to create Sankey diagrams, and top articles were selected based on citation count.\nThis analysis reveals the rapid expansion of AI in SOT. Key areas include robotic surgery, organ allocation, outcome prediction, immunosuppression management, and precision medicine. Robotic surgery has improved transplant outcomes. AI algorithms optimize organ matching and enhance fairness. Machine learning models predict outcomes and guide treatment, while AI-based systems advance personalized immunosuppression. AI in precision medicine, including diagnostics and imaging, is crucial for transplant success.\nThis study highlights AI's transformative potential in SOT, with significant contributions from countries like the USA, Canada, and the UK. Key institutions such as the University of Toronto and the University of Pittsburgh have played vital roles. However, practical challenges like ethical issues, bias, and data integration remain. Fostering international and interdisciplinary collaborations is crucial for overcoming these challenges and accelerating AI's integration into clinical practice, ultimately improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Evaluate the accuracy and reliability of various generative artificial intelligence (AI) models (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, T5, Llama-2, Mistral-Large, and Claude-3 Opus) in predicting Emergency Severity Index (ESI) levels for pediatric emergency department patients and assess the impact of medically oriented fine-tuning.\nSeventy pediatric clinical vignettes from the ESI Handbook version 4 were used as the gold standard. Each AI model predicted the ESI level for each vignette. Performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, were calculated. Reliability was assessed by repeating the tests and measuring the interrater reliability using Fleiss kappa. Paired t tests were used to compare the models before and after fine-tuning.\nClaude-3 Opus achieved the highest performance amongst the untrained models with a sensitivity of 80.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 63.6-90.7), specificity of 91.3% (95% CI: 83.8-99), and an F1 score of 73.9% (95% CI: 58.9-90.7). After fine-tuning, the GPT-4.0 model showed statistically significant improvement with a sensitivity of 77.1% (95% CI: 60.1-86.5), specificity of 92.5% (95% CI: 89.5-97.4), and an F1 score of 74.6% (95% CI: 63.9-83.8, P < 0.04). Reliability analysis revealed high agreement for Claude-3 Opus (Fleiss \u03ba: 0.85), followed by Mistral-Large (Fleiss \u03ba: 0.79) and trained GPT-4.0 (Fleiss \u03ba: 0.67). Training improved the reliability of GPT models (P < 0.001).\nGenerative AI models demonstrate promising accuracy in predicting pediatric ESI levels, with fine-tuning significantly enhancing their performance and reliability. These findings suggest that AI could serve as a valuable tool in pediatric triage.",

    "abstract": "In this article, the authors propose a repurposing of the concept of entrustment to help guide the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in health professions education (HPE). Entrustment can help identify and mitigate the risks of incorporating generative AI tools with limited transparency about their accuracy, source material, and disclosure of bias into HPE practice. With AI's growing role in education-related activities, like automated medical school application screening and feedback quality and content appraisal, there is a critical need for a trust-based approach to ensure these technologies are beneficial and safe. Drawing parallels with HPE's entrustment concept, which assesses a trainee's readiness to perform clinical tasks-or entrustable professional activities-the authors propose assessing the trustworthiness of AI tools to perform an HPE-related task across 3 characteristics: ability (competence to perform tasks accurately), integrity (transparency and honesty), and benevolence (alignment with ethical principles). The authors draw on existing theories of entrustment decision-making to envision a structured way to decide on AI's role and level of engagement in HPE-related tasks, including proposing an AI-specific entrustment scale. Identifying tasks that AI could be entrusted with provides a focus around which considerations of trustworthiness and entrustment decision-making may be synthesized, making explicit the risks associated with AI use and identifying strategies to mitigate these risks. Responsible, trustworthy, and ethical use of AI requires health professions educators to develop safeguards for using it in teaching, learning, and practice-guardrails that can be operationalized via applying the entrustment concept to AI. Without such safeguards, HPE practice stands to be shaped by the oncoming wave of AI innovations tied to commercial motivations, rather than modeled after HPE principles-principles rooted in the trust and transparency that are built together with trainees and patients.",

    "abstract": "Effective evaluation and governance of predictive models used in health care, particularly those driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, are needed to ensure that models are fair, appropriate, valid, effective, and safe, or FAVES. We analyzed data from the 2023 American Hospital Association Annual Survey Information Technology Supplement to identify how AI and predictive models are used and evaluated for accuracy and bias in hospitals. Hospitals use AI and predictive models to predict health trajectories or risks for inpatients, identify high-risk outpatients to inform follow-up care, monitor health, recommend treatments, simplify or automate billing procedures, and facilitate scheduling. We found that 65\u00a0percent of US hospitals used predictive models, and 79\u00a0percent of those used models from their electronic health record developer. Sixty-one percent of hospitals that used models evaluated them for accuracy using data from their health system (local evaluation), but only 44\u00a0percent reported local evaluation for bias. Hospitals that developed their own predictive models, had high operating margins, and were health system members were more likely to report local evaluation. Policy and programs that provide technical support, tools to assess FAVES principles, and educational resources would help ensure that all hospitals can use predictive models safely and prevent a new organizational digital divide in AI.",

    "abstract": "As in many other sectors, artificial intelligence has an impact on health. Artificial intelligence anxiety may occur because of a lack of knowledge about the effects of artificial intelligence, its outcomes, and how it will be used, as well as potential labor concerns. This study aims to determine the artificial intelligence anxiety levels of nursing students and examine whether there is a relationship with their self-efficacy levels. This cross-sectional study, conducted at a public nursing school in Turkey, involved 317 nursing students. Data were collected using a personal information form, the General Self-efficacy Scale, and the Artificial Intelligence Anxiety Scale. There was a negative, moderately strong correlation between the General Self-efficacy Scale and the learning subdimension (r = -0.369) and the Artificial Intelligence Anxiety Scale (r = -0.313) and a weak negative correlation between the job replacement subdimension (r = -0.215), sociotechnical blindness subdimension (r = -0.232), and artificial intelligence configuration subdimension (r = -0.211). The General Self-efficacy Scale has a significant negative effect on the Artificial Intelligence Anxiety Scale (\u03b2 = -.313, t = -5.845, P < .05). These findings suggest that higher self-efficacy is associated with lower artificial intelligence anxiety. It is recommended to enhance technical competence and self-efficacy in nursing education.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence into medicine has attracted increasing attention in recent years. ChatGPT has emerged as a promising tool for delivering evidence-based recommendations in various clinical domains. However, the application of ChatGPT to physical therapy for musculoskeletal conditions has yet to be investigated.\nThirty clinical questions related to spinal, lower extremity, and upper extremity conditions were quired to ChatGPT-4. Responses were assessed for accuracy against clinical practice guidelines by two reviewers. Intra- and inter-rater reliability were measured using Fleiss' kappa (k).\nChatGPT's responses were consistent with CPG recommendations for 80% of the questions. Performance was highest for upper extremity conditions (100%) and lowest for spinal conditions (60%), with a moderate performance for lower extremity conditions (87%). Intra-rater reliability was good (k\u2009=\u20090.698 and k\u2009=\u20090.631 for the two reviewers), and inter-rater reliability was very good (k\u2009=\u20090.847).\nChatGPT demonstrates promise as a supplementary decision-making support tool for physical therapy, with good accuracy and reliability in aligning with clinical practice guideline recommendations. Further research is needed to evaluate its performance across broader scenarios and refine its clinical applicability.",

    "abstract": "Although the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medicine and healthcare holds transformative potential, significant challenges must be necessarily addressed. This technological innovation requires a commitment to ethical principles. Key issues concern autonomy, reliability, and bias. Furthermore, AI development must guarantee rigorous data privacy and security standards. Effective AI implementation demands thorough validation, transparency, and the involvement of multidisciplinary teams to oversee ethical considerations. These issues also concern pain medicine where careful assessment of subjective experiences and individualized care are crucial. Notably, in this rapidly evolving technological landscape, politics plays a pivotal role in establishing rules and regulations. Regulatory frameworks, such as the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act and recent U.S. executive orders, provide essential guidelines for the responsible use of AI. This step is crucial for balancing innovation with rigorous ethical standards, ultimately leveraging the incredible AI's benefits. As the field evolves rapidly and concepts like algorethics and data ethics become more widespread, the scientific community is increasingly recognizing the need for specialists in this area, such as AI Ethics Specialists.",

    "abstract": "Though simple in its fundamental mechanism - a critical disruption of local blood supply - stroke is complicated by the intricate nature of the neural substrate, the neurovascular architecture, and their complex interactions in generating its clinical manifestations. This complexity is adequately described by high-resolution imaging with sensitivity not only to parenchymal macrostructure but also microstructure and functional tissue properties, in conjunction with detailed characterization of vascular topology and dynamics. Such descriptive richness mandates models of commensurate complexity only artificial intelligence could plausibly deliver, if we are to achieve the goal of individually precise, personalized care.\nAdvances in machine vision technology, especially deep learning, are delivering higher fidelity predictive, descriptive, and inferential tools, incorporating increasingly rich imaging information within ever more flexible models. Impact at the clinical front line remains modest, however, owing to the challenges of delivering models robust to the noisy, incomplete, biased, and comparatively small-scale data characteristic of real-world practice.\nThe potential benefit of introducing AI to stroke, in imaging and elsewhere, is now unquestionable, but the optimal approach - and the path to real-world application - remain unsettled. Deep generative models offer a compelling solution to current obstacles and are predicted powerfully to catalyse innovation in the field.",

    "abstract": "Emergency nurses face various challenging conditions and many moral distress that may associated with fatigue from providing care. The spiritual intelligence of nurses has been found to have an impact on the quality of care. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the spiritual intelligence of emergency nurses with fatigue from providing care and moral distress in emergency nurses.\nThis descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 nurses working in the emergency departments of hospitals in Semnan and Sabzevar, who were selected by stratified random method. They were asked to complete the spiritual intelligence, nurse fatigue scale, and moral distress questionnaire through self-reporting. The data were analyzed using SPSS 26 and Amos software, path analysis, and correlation tests.\nAn increase in spiritual intelligence leads to a significant reduction in moral distress (\nThe results showed that spiritual intelligence has an inverse relationship with moral distress and fatigue from providing care. Moral distress has a direct relationship with fatigue from providing care. Therefore, interventions in the field of increasing spiritual intelligence and reducing moral distress and fatigue from providing care are recommended.",

    "abstract": "The continuous integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical settings requires the development of up-to-date and robust guidelines and standard frameworks that consider the evolving challenges of AI implementation in medicine. This review evaluates the quality of these guideline and summarizes ethical frameworks, best practices, and recommendations.\nThe Appraisal of Guidelines, Research, and Evaluation II tool was used to assess the quality of guidelines based on 6 domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. The protocol of this review including the eligibility criteria, the search strategy data extraction sheet and methods, was published prior to the actual review with International Registered Report Identifier of DERR1-10.2196/47105.\nThe initial search resulted in 4975 studies from 2 databases and 7 studies from manual search. Eleven articles were selected for data extraction based on the eligibility criteria. We found that while guidelines generally excel in scope, purpose, and editorial independence, there is significant variability in applicability and the rigor of guideline development. Well-established initiatives such as TRIPOD+AI, DECIDE-AI, SPIRIT-AI, and CONSORT-AI have shown high quality, particularly in terms of stakeholder involvement. However, applicability remains a prominent challenge among the guidelines. The result also showed that the reproducibility, ethical, and environmental aspects of AI in medicine still need attention from both medical and AI communities.\nOur work highlights the need for working toward the development of integrated and comprehensive reporting guidelines that adhere to the principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability. This alignment is essential for fostering a cultural shift toward transparency and open science, which are pivotal milestone for sustainable digital health research.\nThis review evaluates the current reporting guidelines, discussing their advantages as well as challenges and limitations.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has dramatically improved the prognosis for some cancers but can be associated with myocarditis, adverse cardiovascular events, and mortality.\nThe aim of this study was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict the increased likelihood for the development of ICI-related myocarditis and adverse cardiovascular events.\nCancer patients treated with ICI at a tertiary institution from 2011 to 2022 were reviewed. Baseline characteristics, laboratory values, electrocardiograms, and cardiovascular clinical outcomes were extracted. A composite outcome of ICI-related myocarditis and major adverse cardiovascular events (transient ischemic attack/stroke, new diagnosis of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death) was used to develop a multimodal joint fusion AI model by combining baseline tabular data with electrocardiogram (ECG) in a single end-to-end model. ECG data were parsed using 1-D convolution and tubular data using multilayer perceptron.\nOf 2,258 cancer patients who had ICI therapy and troponin measurement (mean age 68.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.5\u00a0years, 59.7% male), the composite of cardiovascular clinical adverse events, including ICI-related myocarditis and major adverse cardiovascular events, occurred in 264 (11.7%) unique patients, with 428 events overall (including 59 [3%] ICI-related myocarditis events and 59 [3%] cardiac deaths). The proposed joint fusion model outperformed individual ECG and baseline electronic medical record data and laboratory value models with an area under the operating characteristics curve of 0.72 (0.64 true positive rate and 0.98 negative predictive value).\nA multimodal fusion AI model to predict myocarditis and adverse cardiovascular events in cancer patients starting ICI therapy had good prognostic performance. It may have clinical utility in identifying at-risk patients who may benefit from closer surveillance.",

    "abstract": "The current study presents a multiphysics numerical model for a micro-planar proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell (H-SOFC). The numerical model considered an anode-supported H-SOFC with direct internal reforming (DIR) of methane. The model solves coupled nonlinear equations, including continuity, momentum, mass transfer, chemical and electrochemical reactions, and energy equations. Furthermore, The numerical model results are used in artificial intelligence (AI) models, the K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and, artificial neural network (ANN), to predict the current density and power density of the H-SOFC. The results show that increasing the air-to-fuel (A/F) ratio decreases the current density and overall cell power. In particular, improvements in power and current density observed in H-SOFC when the A/F ratio is set to 0.5, resulting in a respective increase of 2\u00a0% and 7\u00a0% compared to the initial state at A/F\u00a0=\u00a01. With an error rate of less than 1\u00a0% and an R-score of around 99\u00a0%, the ANN model shows good agreement with the numerical results.",

    "abstract": "Our opinion piece pays homage to the evolution of medical practices, tracing back to the era of Hippocrates, through significant historical milestones, and drawing parallels with the principles underpinning foundational artificial intelligence (AI) models. It emphasizes the shared ethos of both domains: a commitment to comprehensive care that values diverse data integration and individualized patient treatment. The excitement surrounding foundation models in medical imaging is understandable. However, a critical and cautious approach is crucial before widespread adoption. By addressing the present 4 major limitations (ie, data bias and generalizability, interpretability of AI models, data scarcity and diversity, and computational resources and infrastructure) and fostering a culture of rigorous research, we can unlock the true potential of these models and revolutionize medical care. This critique (opinion) paper highlights the need for a more measured approach in the field of ",

    "abstract": "The levels of M2 macrophages are significantly associated with the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, current detection methods in clinical settings remain challenging. Our study aims to develop a weakly supervised artificial intelligence model using globally labeled histological images, to predict M2 macrophage levels and forecast the prognosis of HCC patients by integrating clinical features.\nCIBERSORTx was used to calculate M2 macrophage abundance. We developed a slide-level, weakly-supervised clustering method for Whole Slide Images (WSIs) by integrating Masked Autoencoders (MAE) with ResNet-32t to predict M2 macrophage abundance.\nWe developed an MAE-ResNet model to predict M2 macrophage levels using WSIs. In the testing dataset, the area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI) was 0.73 (0.59-0.87). We constructed a Cox regression model showing that the predicted probabilities of M2 macrophage abundance were negatively associated with the prognosis of HCC (HR=1.89, p=0.031). Furthermore, we incorporated clinical data, screened variables using Lasso regression, and built the comprehensive prediction model that better predicted prognosis. (HR=2.359, p=0.001).\nOur models effectively predicted M2 macrophage levels and HCC prognosis. The findings suggest that our models offer a novel method for determining biomarker levels and forecasting prognosis, eliminating additional clinical tests, thereby delivering substantial clinical benefits.",

As technology continues to evolve, AI offers an unprecedented opportunity to transform how we diagnose, treat, and improve access to reproductive services, especially in underserved communities. AI-driven tools, supported by machine learning and big data analytics, are already demonstrating their potential in enhancing outcomes in reproductive health. These tools can predict fertility outcomes with impressive accuracy, optimize in vitro fertilization (IVF) success rates, and identify early signs of reproductive disorders, such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and ovarian cancer. By analyzing biomarkers, medical histories, and lifestyle factors, AI algorithms empower healthcare providers to deliver personalized and effective treatment plans tailored to individual needs.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) as one of the most common cardiovascular diseases has attracted great attention due to its high disability and mortality rate. Thus, a timely and effective recognition method for AF is of great importance for diagnosing and preventing it. Herein, we proposed a novel intelligent sensing and recognition system for AF which combined Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), flexible wearable electronic devices, and artificial intelligence. Experiment and simulation synergistically verified that the flexible pressure sensor arrays designed according to the TCM theory could synchronously obtain the 3D pulses at Cun, Guan, and Chi. Combined with a homemade signal acquisition system and the pulse signals labeled by doctors of cardiovascular diseases, the differences in the 3D pulse signals between ones with AF and without can be picked up clearly. Enabled the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the pulse database, the recognition model was formed with a recognition rate of up to 90%. As a proof of concept, the artificial intelligence-enabled novel atrial fibrillation diagnosis system has been used to detect patients with AF in hospitals, showing 80% recognition rate. This work provides a new strategy to precisely diagnose and remotely treat AF, as well as to accelerate the development of Modern Chinese Medicine treatment.",

    "abstract": "The increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance has prompted a need for more effective antimicrobial stewardship programs (AMS). Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools have emerged as potential solutions to enhance decision-making and improve patient outcomes in AMS. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the impact of AI in AMS and to assess its predictive performance and diagnostic accuracy. We conducted a comprehensive literature search across PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science to identify studies published up to July 2024. Studies included were observational, cohort, or retrospective, focusing on the application of AI/ML in AMS. The outcomes assessed were the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). We calculated the mean pooled effect size (ES) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effects model. The risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-AI tool, and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO. Out of 3,458 retrieved articles, 80 studies met the inclusion criteria. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that ML models exhibited strong predictive performance and diagnostic accuracy, with the following results: AUC [ES: 72.28 (70.42-74.14)], accuracy [ES: 74.97 (73.35-76.58)], sensitivity [ES: 76.89; (71.90-81.89)], specificity [ES: 73.77; (67.87-79.67)], NPV [ES:79.92 (76.54-83.31)], and PPV [ES: 69.41 (60.19-78.63)] across various AMS settings. AI and ML tools offer promising enhancements due to their strong predictive performance. The integration of AI into AMS could lead to more precise antimicrobial prescribing, reduced antimicrobial resistance, and better resource utilization.",

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic exploration (LE) is crucial for diagnosing intra-abdominal metastasis (IAM) in advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, overlooking single, tiny, and occult IAM lesions during LE can severely affect the treatment and prognosis due to surgeons' visual misinterpretations. To address this, we developed the artificial intelligence laparoscopic exploration system (AiLES) to recognize IAM lesions with various metastatic extents and locations. The AiLES was developed based on a dataset consisting of 5111 frames from 100 videos, using 4130 frames for model development and 981 frames for evaluation. The AiLES achieved a Dice score of 0.76 and a recognition speed of 11 frames per second, demonstrating robust performance in different metastatic extents (0.74-0.76) and locations (0.63-0.90). Furthermore, AiLES performed comparably to novice surgeons in IAM recognition and excelled in recognizing tiny and occult lesions. Our results demonstrate that the implementation of AiLES could enhance accurate tumor staging and assist individualized treatment decisions.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) may be used to learn and predict the maxillomandibular relationship, particularly when the number of occluding teeth pairs is insufficient. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of training a new two-stage coarse-to-fine teeth alignment pipeline AI system in predicting maxillomandibular relationships based on the occlusal morphology of antagonistic teeth.\nMaxillary and mandibular stone casts were collected and scanned at the maximal intercuspal position (MIP). A deep learning alignment network was trained using 90% of cast pairs. The remaining 10% of pairs were input into the trained AI system for validation. The maxillomandibular relationships predicted by the AI system were superimposed and compared with those of the mounted casts. Cartesian x-, y-, and z-coordinates were defined for each mandibular tooth scan with respect to (w.r.t.) its occlusal plane and dental midline. The discrepancy in the position of maxillary teeth scans was described based on rotation and translation.\nA total of 325 pairs of maxillary and mandibular stone casts were collected, with 300 pairs used for training and 25 for validation. For the AI-predicted maxillomandibular relationship, the mean rotational discrepancies w.r.t. the x-, y-, and z-axis were 1.407\u00b0\u00b11.548\u00b0, 1.269\u00b0\u00b18.476\u00b0, and 0.730\u00b0\u00b11.334\u00b0, respectively. The mean translational discrepancies w.r.t. the x-, y-, and z-axis were 0.185\u00b11.324 mm, 1.222\u00b10.848 mm, -1.034\u00b10.273 mm, respectively.\nThe AI-predicted maxillomandibular relationship for maxillary and mandibular teeth scans shows discrepancies of less than 1.3 mm and 1.5\u00b0 compared to the actual relationships.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly relevant in various sectors, including higher education. This study investigates the psychosocial factors influencing AI adoption among Peruvian university students and uses an extended UTAUT2 model to examine various constructs that may impact AI acceptance and use.\nThis study employed a quantitative approach with a survey-based design. A total of 482 students from public and private universities in Peru participated in the research. The study utilized partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the data and test the hypothesized relationships between the constructs.\nThe findings revealed that three out of the six hypothesized factors significantly influenced AI adoption among Peruvian university students. Performance expectancy (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.274), social influence (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.355), and AI learning self-efficacy (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.431) were found to have significant positive effects on AI adoption. In contrast to expectations, ethical awareness, perceived playfulness, AI readiness and AI anxiety did not have significant impacts on AI appropriation in this context.\nThis study highlights the importance of practical benefits, the social context, and self-confidence in the adoption of AI within Peruvian higher education. These findings contribute to the understanding of AI adoption in diverse educational settings and provide a framework for developing effective AI implementation strategies in higher education institutions. The results can guide universities and policymakers in creating targeted approaches to enhance AI adoption and integration in academic environments, focusing on demonstrating the practical value of AI, leveraging social networks, and building students' confidence in their ability to learn and use AI technologies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most incapacitating neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). PD is the second most common NDD worldwide which affects approximately 1-2 percent of people over 65 years. It is an attractive pursuit for artificial intelligence (AI) to contribute to and evolve PD treatments through drug repositioning by repurposing existing drugs, shelved drugs, or even candidates that do not meet the criteria for clinical trials. A search was conducted in three databases Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. We reviewed the data related to the last years (1975-present) to identify those drugs currently being proposed for repositioning in PD. Moreover, we reviewed the present status of the computational approach, including AI/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-powered pharmaceutical discovery efforts and their implementation in PD treatment. It was found that the number of drug repositioning studies for PD has increased recently. Repositioning of drugs in PD is taking off, and scientific communities are increasingly interested in communicating its results and finding effective treatment alternatives for PD. A better chance of success in PD drug discovery has been made possible due to AI/ML algorithm advancements. In addition to the experimentation stage of drug discovery, it is also important to leverage AI in the planning stage of clinical trials to make them more effective. New AI-based models or solutions that increase the success rate of drug development are greatly needed.",

    "abstract": "To identify and assess artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled products reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that are potentially applicable to emergency medicine (EM).\nThe FDA AI-enabled products website was accessed to identify all marketed products as of March 2024. Board-certified EM physicians analyzed all products for applicability to EM practice. Inclusion criteria included products used by EM physicians directly or non-EM physicians participating directly in the evaluation and management of patients in an acute care setting. The Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) Evidence Rating Matrix was used to rate the net health benefit of applicable products.\nA total of 882 AI-enabled products have been reviewed by the FDA from 1995 to 2024. There were 272 products that were updates of prior products that were excluded, leaving 610 unique products. Products were most commonly evaluated by Radiology (454/610), Cardiovascular (59/610), and Neurology (25/610) panels. We found 154 (25\u00a0%) products applicable to EM that were approved through Radiology (121/154), Cardiovascular (24/154), Neurology (5/154), Anesthesiology (3/154), and Ophthalmology (1/154) panels. There were 30 products that were rated as having a comparable or incremental net health benefit with moderate certainty (a C+ rating).\nAn increasing number of AI-enabled products are available and regulated by the FDA. We have identified 154 that are applicable to EM, primarily related to assisting with diagnosis on various imaging modalities. There remain many opportunities for EM to assist in product reviews and meaningful translation of products into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Over 90% of pregnant women and 76% expectant fathers search for pregnancy health information. We examined readability, accuracy and quality of answers to common obstetric anesthesia questions from the popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots ChatGPT and Bard.\nTwenty questions for generative AI chatbots were derived from frequently asked questions based on professional society, hospital and consumer websites. ChatGPT and Bard were queried in November 2023. Answers were graded for accuracy by four obstetric anesthesiologists. Quality was measured using Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Print (PEMAT). Readability was measured using six readability indices. Accuracy, quality and readability were compared using independent t-test.\nBard readability scores were high school level, significantly easier than ChatGPT's college level by all scoring metrics (P\u00a0<0.001). Bard had significantly longer answers (P\u00a0<0.001), yet with similar accuracy of Bard (85\u00a0% \u00b1 10) and ChatGPT (87\u00a0% \u00b1 14) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.5). PEMAT understandability scores were no statistically significantly different (P\u00a0=\u00a00.06). Actionability by PEMAT scores for Bard was significantly higher (22% vs. 9%) than ChatGPT (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) CONCLUSION: Answers to questions about \"labor epidurals\" should be accurate, high quality, and easy to read. Bard at high school reading level, was well above the goal 4",

    "abstract": "The Adelaide Score is an artificial intelligence system that integrates objective vital signs and laboratory tests to predict likelihood of hospital discharge.\nA prospective implementation trial was conducted at the Lyell McEwin Hospital in South Australia. The Adelaide Score was added to existing human, artificial intelligence, and other technological infrastructure for the first 28\u2009days of April 2024 (intervention), and outcomes were compared using parametric, non-parametric and health economic analyses, to those in the first 28\u2009days of April 2023 (control). Artificial intelligence evaluated inpatients admitted under 18 surgical and medical teams, and patients of high likelihood of discharge were provided, on working shifts between Thursday to Sunday, to the Supportive Weekend Interprofessional Flow Team (SWIFT) comprising a senior nurse and pharmacist.\nTwo thousand nine hundred and sixty-eight admissions were included across intervention and control periods. Relative to the control group, use of the Adelaide Score in the intervention group resulted in significantly shorter median length of stay (3.1 versus 2.9\u2009days, P\u2009=\u20090.028) and significantly lower seven-day readmission rate (7.1 versus 5.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.02). The 0.2 bed-day reduction in median length of stay produced a cost saving of $735\u2009708.60 across the 28-day period, or $9\u2009564\u2009211.80 across a 52-week\u2009year. There was no significant difference between intervention and control groups in median length of stay for patients discharged on weekends, in-hospital mortality, or discharge to non-home destinations.\nThe prospective implementation of the Adelaide Score was associated with improved hospital and cost efficiency, alongside lower readmissions, for patients across surgical and medical services.",

Dental students will undoubtedly be impacted by the emergence of AI in dentistry.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of a group of Egyptian dental students toward artificial intelligence.\nAn online survey was conducted using a questionnaire sent to dental students via Google Forms. The questionnaire comprised 18 questions on participant's knowledge and perceptions regarding the future of AI in dentistry. The collected data was statistically analyzed.\nA total of 384 students answered the questionnaire. Of the participants, (49%) had a basic knowledge of the principles of AI, and (48%) participants were aware of AI usage in dentistry. Social media was the most common information source for AI applications. Most of the participants agreed on the leading role of AI in the advancement of dentistry and disagreed on the ability of AI to replace dentists in the future, (53%) and (44%) respectively. Moreover, (49%) and (52%) respectively of students approved the incorporation of AI applications in undergraduate and postgraduate dental training.\nEgyptian dental students are acquainted with AI and its possible applications in dentistry. They consider the use of AI diagnosis exciting and approve of its definitive role in disease prediction. There is a necessity to include, enhance, and increase AI training in dental schools.\nThis study has been registered in clinical trials. gov with an identifier: NCT06348758.",

    "abstract": "This review aims to evaluate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on cancer health equity, specifically investigating whether AI is addressing or widening disparities in cancer outcomes.\nRecent studies demonstrate significant advancements in AI, such as deep learning for cancer diagnosis and predictive analytics for personalized treatment, showing potential for improved precision in care. However, concerns persist about the performance of AI tools across diverse populations due to biased training data. Access to AI technologies also remains limited, particularly in low-income and rural settings. AI holds promise for advancing cancer care, but its current application risks exacerbating existing health disparities. To ensure AI benefits all populations, future research must prioritize inclusive datasets, integrate social determinants of health, and develop ethical frameworks. Addressing these challenges is crucial for AI to contribute positively to cancer health equity and guide future research and policy development.",

    "abstract": "Detecting brain tumours (BT) early improves treatment possibilities and increases patient survival rates. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning offers more comprehensive information, such as better contrast and clarity, than any alternative scanning process. Manually separating BTs from several MRI images gathered in medical practice for cancer analysis is challenging and time-consuming. Tumours and MRI scans of the brain are exposed utilizing methods and machine learning technologies, simplifying the process for doctors. MRI images can sometimes appear normal even when a patient has a tumour or malignancy. Deep learning approaches have recently depended on deep convolutional neural networks to analyze medical images with promising outcomes. It supports saving lives faster and rectifying some medical errors. With this motivation, this article presents a new explainable artificial intelligence with semantic segmentation and Bayesian machine learning for brain tumors (XAISS-BMLBT) technique. The presented XAISS-BMLBT technique mainly concentrates on the semantic segmentation and classification of BT in MRI images. The presented XAISS-BMLBT approach initially involves bilateral filtering-based image pre-processing to eliminate the noise. Next, the XAISS-BMLBT technique performs the MEDU-Net+ segmentation process to define the impacted brain regions. For the feature extraction process, the ResNet50 model is utilized. Furthermore, the Bayesian regularized artificial neural network (BRANN) model is used to identify the presence of BTs. Finally, an improved radial movement optimization model is employed for the hyperparameter tuning of the BRANN technique. To highlight the improved performance of the XAISS-BMLBT technique, a series of simulations were accomplished by utilizing a benchmark database. The experimental validation of the XAISS-BMLBT technique portrayed a superior accuracy value of 97.75% over existing models.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to address growing logistical and economic pressures on the health care system by reducing risk, increasing productivity, and improving patient safety; however, implementing digital health technologies can be disruptive. Workforce perception is a powerful indicator of technology use and acceptance, however, there is little research available on the perceptions of allied health professionals (AHPs) toward AI in health care.\nThis study aimed to explore AHP perceptions of AI and the opportunities and challenges for its use in health care delivery.\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted at a health service in, Queensland, Australia, using the Shinners Artificial Intelligence Perception tool.\nA total of 231 (22.1%) participants from 11 AHPs responded to the survey. Participants were mostly younger than 40 years (157/231, 67.9%), female (189/231, 81.8%), working in a clinical role (196/231, 84.8%) with a median of 10 years' experience in their profession. Most participants had not used AI (185/231, 80.1%), had little to no knowledge about AI (201/231, 87%), and reported workforce knowledge and skill as the greatest challenges to incorporating AI in health care (178/231, 77.1%). Age (P=.01), profession (P=.009), and AI knowledge (P=.02) were strong predictors of the perceived professional impact of AI. AHPs generally felt unprepared for the implementation of AI in health care, with concerns about a lack of workforce knowledge on AI and losing valued tasks to AI. Prior use of AI (P=.02) and years of experience as a health care professional (P=.02) were significant predictors of perceived preparedness for AI. Most participants had not received education on AI (190/231, 82.3%) and desired training (170/231, 73.6%) and believed AI would improve health care. Ideas and opportunities suggested for the use of AI within the allied health setting were predominantly nonclinical, administrative, and to support patient assessment tasks, with a view to improving efficiencies and increasing clinical time for direct patient care.\nEducation and experience with AI are needed in health care to support its implementation across allied health, the second largest workforce in health. Industry and academic partnerships with clinicians should not be limited to AHPs with high AI literacy as clinicians across all knowledge levels can identify many opportunities for AI in health care.",

Participants were mostly younger than 40 years (157/231, 67.9%), female (189/231, 81.8%), working in a clinical role (196/231, 84.8%) with a median of 10 years' experience in their profession. Most participants had not used AI (185/231, 80.1%), had little to no knowledge about AI (201/231, 87%), and reported workforce knowledge and skill as the greatest challenges to incorporating AI in health care (178/231, 77.1%). Age (P=.01), profession (P=.009), and AI knowledge (P=.02) were strong predictors of the perceived professional impact of AI. AHPs generally felt unprepared for the implementation of AI in health care, with concerns about a lack of workforce knowledge on AI and losing valued tasks to AI. Prior use of AI (P=.02) and years of experience as a health care professional (P=.02) were significant predictors of perceived preparedness for AI. Most participants had not received education on AI (190/231, 82.3%) and desired training (170/231, 73.6%) and believed AI would improve health care. Ideas and opportunities suggested for the use of AI within the allied health setting were predominantly nonclinical, administrative, and to support patient assessment tasks, with a view to improving efficiencies and increasing clinical time for direct patient care.",

    "abstract": "Exploring new pathways for the growth of output in the mariculture industry and its alignment with environmentally coordinated and sustainable development has become an urgent task. Against the backdrop of the new technological revolution, the burgeoning development of industrial intelligence offers new opportunities for enhancing the ecological efficiency of China's mariculture. Based on panel data from coastal provinces of China from 2008 to 2022, this paper measures the ecological efficiency of mariculture while comprehensively considering both positive and negative externalities of the industry. This article further investigates the impact of industrial intelligence on the ecological efficiency of mariculture, delves into the role mechanism of industrial upgrading in this context, and explores the issue of regional heterogeneity. The results indicate that, regardless of the inclusion of control variables or fixed effects, industrial intelligence has a significant positive effect on the ecological efficiency of China's mariculture. The promotion effect is strongest in the Bohai Rim economic zone, followed by the Pan-Pearl River Delta economic zone. Furthermore, industrial upgrading serves as a crucial mediating channel through which industrial intelligence exerts its impact. Specifically, industrial intelligence enhances ecological efficiency by facilitating the continuous advancement of the industry towards higher-level and more rational structural configurations.",

    "abstract": "This study intends to optimize the carbon footprint management model of power enterprises through artificial intelligence (AI) technology to help the scientific formulation of carbon emission reduction strategies. Firstly, a carbon footprint calculation model based on big data and AI is established, and then machine learning algorithm is used to deeply mine the carbon emission data of power enterprises to identify the main influencing factors and emission reduction opportunities. Finally, the driver-state-response (DSR) model is used to evaluate the carbon audit of the power industry and comprehensively analyze the effect of carbon emission reduction. Taking China Electric Power Resources and Datang International Electric Power Company as examples, this study uses the comprehensive evaluation method of entropy weight- technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). China Electric Power Resources Company has outstanding performance in promoting renewable energy, with its comprehensive evaluation index rising from 0.5458 in 2020 to 0.627 in 2022, while the evaluation index of Datang International Electric Power Company fluctuated and dropped to 0.421 in 2021. The research conclusion reveals the actual achievements and existing problems of power enterprises in energy saving and emission reduction, and provides reliable carbon information for the government, enterprises, and the public. The main innovation of this study lies in: using artificial intelligence technology to build a carbon footprint calculation model, combining with the data of International Energy Agency Carbon Dioxide (IEA CO2) emission database, and using machine learning algorithm to deeply mine the important factors in carbon emission data, thus putting forward a carbon audit evaluation system of power enterprises based on DSR model. This study not only fills the blank of carbon emission management methods in the power industry, but also provides a new perspective and basis for the government and enterprises to formulate carbon emission reduction strategies.",

    "abstract": "The latest global progress report highlights numerous challenges in achieving justice goals, with bias in artificial intelligence (AI) emerging as a significant yet underexplored issue. This paper investigates the role of AI in addressing bias within the judicial system to promote equitable social justice. Analyzing weekly data from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2023, through wavelet quantile correlation, this study examines the short, medium, and long-term impacts of integrating AI, media, international legal influence (ILI), and international financial institutions (IFI) as crucial factors in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG-16), which focuses on justice. The findings indicate that AI, media, ILI, and IFI can help reduce bias in the medium and long term, although their effects appear mixed and less significant in the short term. Our research proposes a comprehensive policy framework that addresses the complexities of implementing these technologies in the judicial system. We conclude that successfully integrating AI requires a supportive global policy environment that embraces technological innovation, financial backing, and robust regulation to prevent potential disruptions that could reinforce inequalities, perpetuate structural injustices, and exacerbate human rights issues, ultimately leading to more biased outcomes in social justice.",

    "abstract": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) in medical education offers both opportunities and challenges. While these AI-driven tools can enhance access to information and support critical thinking, they also pose risks like potential overreliance and ethical concerns. To ensure ethical use, students and instructors must recognize the limitations of LLMs, maintain academic integrity, handle data cautiously, and instructors should prioritize content quality over AI detection methods. LLMs can be used as supplementary aids rather than primary educational resources, with a focus on enhancing accessibility, equity, and fostering a culture of feedback and AI literacy among students and instructors. Institutions should create guidelines that align with their unique educational values, providing clear frameworks that support responsible LLM usage while addressing risks associated with AI in education. Such guidelines should reflect the institution's pedagogical mission, whether centered on clinical practice, research, or a mix of both, and should be adaptable to evolving educational technologies.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly advancing precision medicine, particularly in the fields of immunogenomics, radiomics, and pathomics. In immunogenomics, AI can process vast amounts of genomic and multi-omic data to identify biomarkers associated with immunotherapy responses and disease prognosis, thus providing strong support for personalized treatments. In radiomics, AI can analyze high-dimensional features from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) images to discover imaging biomarkers associated with tumor heterogeneity, treatment response, and disease progression, thereby enabling non-invasive, real-time assessments for personalized therapy. Pathomics leverages AI for deep analysis of digital pathology images, and can uncover subtle changes in tissue microenvironments, cellular characteristics, and morphological features, and offer unique insights into immunotherapy response prediction and biomarker discovery. These AI-driven technologies not only enhance the speed, accuracy, and robustness of biomarker discovery but also significantly improve the precision, personalization, and effectiveness of clinical treatments, and are driving a shift from empirical to precision medicine. Despite challenges such as data quality, model interpretability, integration of multi-modal data, and privacy protection, the ongoing advancements in AI, coupled with interdisciplinary collaboration, are poised to further enhance AI's roles in biomarker discovery and immunotherapy response prediction. These improvements are expected to lead to more accurate, personalized treatment strategies and ultimately better patient outcomes, marking a significant step forward in the evolution of precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "As humanity progresses further into space, astronauts must be increasingly independent from mission control, especially in high-consequence medical scenarios. The high-utility and low-mass nature of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) makes this imaging modality ideal for spaceflight mission deployment. However, POCUS operator skill degrades over time, presenting an operational barrier to continuous, effective use. Further, formal medical education and POCUS-specific training are not requirements for astronaut candidates, potentially exacerbating skill degradation. Artificial intelligence (AI) assistance may mitigate skill decay, enabling long-term POCUS skill retention. To characterize the utility of this paradigm in space, we evaluated AI assistance effects on POCUS skill retention in subject pools with astronaut-mimicking educational demographics.\nThis prospective cohort study included 30 participants, evenly split into unassisted and AI-assisted cohorts. After undergoing 1 training session, participants collected 5 renal images, bladder images, and bladder volume estimations and completed usability and self-confidence surveys immediately, 2 wk, and 8 wk after initial training. Primary outcomes included target organ capture rates, image quality, bladder volume variability, perceived self-confidence, and perceived system usability.\nAI assistance minimized bladder volume variability aggregated over time (\nPOCUS AI decreased bladder volume variability and mitigated system usability decrement. We recommend increasing study duration or reducing the number of data collections in future study designs and the fieldwide adoption of objective ultrasound image-quality metrics.",

    "abstract": "Part 2 explores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing the complexities of headache disorders through innovative approaches, including digital twin models, wearable healthcare technologies and biosensors, and AI-driven drug discovery. Digital twins, as dynamic digital representations of patients, offer opportunities for personalized headache management by integrating diverse datasets such as neuroimaging, multiomics, and wearable sensor data to advance headache research, optimize treatment, and enable virtual trials. In addition, AI-driven wearable devices equipped with next-generation biosensors combined with multi-agent chatbots could enable real-time physiological and biochemical monitoring, diagnosing, facilitating early headache attack forecasting and prevention, disease tracking, and personalized interventions. Furthermore, AI-driven advances in drug discovery leverage machine learning and generative AI to accelerate the identification of novel therapeutic targets and optimize treatment strategies for migraine and other headache disorders. Despite these advances, challenges such as data standardization, model explainability, and ethical considerations remain pivotal. Collaborative efforts between clinicians, biomedical and biotechnological engineers, AI scientists, legal representatives and bioethics experts are essential to overcoming these barriers and unlocking AI's full potential in transforming headache research and healthcare. This is a call to action in proposing novel frameworks for integrating AI-based technologies into headache care.",

    "abstract": "In resource-constrained countries like India, mammography-based breast screening is challenging to implement. This state-wide study, funded by the Government of Punjab, evaluated the use of Thermalytix, a low-cost, radiation-free AI tool, for breast cancer screening. Community health workers, trained to raise awareness, mobilized women aged 30 and above for screening. Thermalytix triaged women into five risk categories based on thermal images, with high-risk women recalled for diagnostic imaging. Over 18 months, 15,069 women were screened across 183 locations in Punjab. The median age was 41 years, and 69.9% were asymptomatic. Of 460 women testing positive (recall rate 3.1%), 268 underwent follow-up imaging, and 27 were confirmed with breast cancer, yielding a detection rate of 0.18%. The positive predictive value of biopsy performed was 81.81%, and the median diagnostic interval was 21 days, with therapy initiation within 30 days. The study demonstrates the potential of Thermalytix for effective population-level breast cancer screening in low-resource settings.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a form of cancer that impacts both the rectum and colon. Typically, it begins with a small abnormal growth known as a polyp, which can either be non-cancerous or cancerous. Therefore, early detection of colorectal cancer as the second deadliest cancer after lung cancer, can be highly beneficial. Moreover, the standard treatment for locally advanced colorectal cancer, which is widely accepted around the world, is chemoradiotherapy. Then, in this study, seven artificial intelligence models including decision tree, K-nearest neighbors, Adaboost, random forest, Gradient Boosting, multi-layer perceptron, and convolutional neural network were implemented to detect patients responder and non-responder to radiochemotherapy. For finding the potential predictors (genes), three feature selection strategies were employed including mutual information, F-classif, and Chi-Square. Based on feature selection models, four different scenarios were developed and five, ten, twenty and thirty features selected for designing a more accurate classification paradigm. The results of this study confirm that random forest, Gradient Boosting, decision tree, and K-nearest neighbors provided more accurate results in terms of accuracy, by 93.8%. Moreover, Among the feature selection methods, mutual information and F-classif showed the best results, while Chi-Square produced the worst results. Therefore, the suggested artificial intelligence models can be successfully applied as a robust approach for classification of colorectal cancer response to radiochemotherapy for medical studies.",

    "abstract": "Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) across numerous disciplines has transformed the worldwide landscape of pandemic response. This review investigates the multidimensional role of AI in the pandemic, which arises as a global health crisis, and its role in preparedness and responses, ranging from enhanced epidemiological modelling to the acceleration of vaccine development. The confluence of AI technologies has guided us in a new era of data-driven decision-making, revolutionizing our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and treat infectious illnesses. The review begins by discussing the impact of a pandemic on emerging countries worldwide, elaborating on the critical significance of AI in epidemiological modelling, bringing data-driven decision-making, and enabling forecasting, mitigation and response to the pandemic. In epidemiology, AI-driven epidemiological models like SIR\u00a0(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) and SIS\u00a0(Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) are applied to predict the spread of disease, preventing outbreaks and optimising vaccine distribution. The review also demonstrates how Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and predictive analytics improve our knowledge of disease propagation patterns. The collaborative aspect of AI in vaccine discovery and clinical trials of various vaccines is emphasised, focusing on constructing AI-powered surveillance networks. Conclusively, the review presents a comprehensive assessment of how AI impacts epidemiological modelling, builds AI-enabled dynamic models by collaborating ML and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, and develops and implements vaccines and clinical trials. The review also focuses on screening, forecasting, contact tracing and monitoring the virus-causing pandemic. It advocates for sustained research, real-world implications, ethical application and strategic integration of AI technologies to strengthen our collective ability to face and alleviate the effects of global health issues.",

    "abstract": "Bladder cancer is the 10th most common and 13th most deadly cancer worldwide, with urothelial carcinomas being the most common type. Distinguishing between non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is essential due to significant differences in management and prognosis. MRI may play an important diagnostic role in this setting. The Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS), a multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)-based consensus reporting platform, allows for standardized preoperative muscle invasion assessment in BCa with proven diagnostic accuracy. However, post-treatment assessment using VI-RADS is challenging because of anatomical changes, especially in the interpretation of the muscle layer. MRI techniques that provide tumor tissue physiological\u00a0information, including diffusion-weighted (DW)- and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, combined with derived quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIBs), may potentially overcome the limitations of BCa evaluation when predominantly focusing on anatomic changes at MRI, particularly in the therapy response setting. Delta-radiomics, which encompasses the assessment of changes (\u0394)\u00a0in image features extracted from mpMRI data, has the potential to monitor treatment response. In comparison to the current Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), QIBs and mpMRI-based radiomics, in combination with artificial intelligence (AI)-based image analysis, may potentially allow for earlier identification of therapy-induced tumor changes. This review provides an update on the potential of QIBs and mpMRI-based radiomics and discusses the future applications of AI in BCa management, particularly in assessing treatment response. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Incorporating mpMRI-based quantitative imaging biomarkers, radiomics, and artificial intelligence into bladder cancer management has the potential to enhance treatment response assessment and prognosis prediction. KEY POINTS: Quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIBs) from mpMRI and radiomics can outperform RECIST for bladder cancer treatments. AI improves mpMRI segmentation and enhances radiomics feature extraction effectively. Predictive models integrate imaging biomarkers and clinical data using AI tools. Multicenter studies with strict criteria validate radiomics and QIBs clinically. Consistent mpMRI and AI applications need reliable validation in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common type of scoliosis, affecting 1-4% of adolescents. The Scoliosis Research Society-22R (SRS-22R), a health-related quality-of-life instrument for AIS, has allowed orthopedists to measure subjective patient outcomes before and after corrective surgery beyond objective radiographic measurements. However, research has revealed that there is no significant correlation between the correction rate in major radiographic parameters and improvements in patient-reported outcomes (PROs), making it difficult to incorporate PROs into personalized surgical planning.\nThe objective of this study is to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled surgical planning and counseling support system for post-operative patient rehabilitation outcomes prediction in order to facilitate personalized AIS patient care. A unique multi-site cohort of 455 pediatric patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery at two Shriners Children's hospitals from 2010 is investigated in our analysis. In total, 171 pre-operative clinical features are used to train six machine-learning models for post-operative outcomes prediction. We further employ explainability analysis to quantify the contribution of pre-operative radiographic and questionnaire parameters in predicting patient surgical outcomes. Moreover, we enable responsible AI by calibrating model confidence for human intervention and mitigating health disparities for algorithm fairness.\nThe best prediction model achieves an area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) performance of 0.86, 0.85, and 0.83 for individual SRS-22R question response prediction over three-time horizons from pre-operation to 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year post-operation, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed prediction method to predict other patient rehabilitation outcomes based on minimal clinically important differences (MCID) and correction rates across all three-time horizons.\nBased on the relationship analysis, we suggest additional attention to sagittal parameters (e.g., lordosis, sagittal vertical axis) and patient self-image beyond major Cobb angles to improve surgical decision-making for AIS patients. In the age of personalized medicine, the proposed responsible AI-enabled clinical decision-support system may facilitate pre-operative counseling and shared decision-making within real-world clinical settings.\nThe goal of this study is to develop a planning and counseling support system for predicting how well patients recover after surgeries. This should allow for more personalized care for scoliosis (spinal curvature) patients. We collected data from 455 pediatric patients who underwent spinal fusion surgery at different locations and used this data to train computer learning methods to predict outcomes after surgery. We show that our proposed computer method can predict the outcome of patient rehabilitation well for short-term (6-month and 1-year) and long-term (2-year) results. We applied additional tests to our method to calculate how well it works and measure fairness to provide a straight-forward, trustworthy, and fair method for real-world clinical use.",

    "abstract": "As per world health organization, Anemia is a most prevalent blood disorder all over the world. Reduced number of Red Blood Cells or decrease in the number of healthy red blood cells is considered as Anemia. This condition also leads to the decrease in the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. The main goal of this research is to develop a dependable method for diagnosing Aplastic Anemia and Iron Deficiency Anemia by examining the blood test attributes. As of today, there are no studies which use Interpretable Artificial Intelligence to perform the above differential diagnosis. The dataset used in this study is collected from Kasturba Medical College, Manipal. The dataset consisted of various blood test attributes such as Red Blood cell count, Hemoglobin level, Mean Corpuscular Volume, etc. One of the trending topics in Machine Learning is Explainable Artificial Intelligence. They are known to demystify the machine learning outputs to all its stakeholders. Hence, Five XAI tools including SHAP, LIME, Eli5, Qlattice and Anchor are used to understand the model's predictions. The importance characteristics according to XAI models are PLT, PCT, MCV, PDW, HGB, ABS LYMP, WBC, MCH, and MCHC. are employed to train and test the data. The goal of using data analytic techniques is to give medical professionals a useful tool that improves decision-making, enhances resource management, and eventually raises the standard of patient care. By considering the unique qualities of each patient, medical professionals who must rely on AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment suggestions, XAI offers arguments to strengthen their faith in the model outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid cytopathology, particularly in cases of atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesions of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS), suffers from suboptimal sensitivity and specificity challenges. Recent advancements in digital pathology and artificial intelligence (AI) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy. This systematic review included studies from 2000 to 2023, focusing on diagnostic accuracy in AUS/FLUS cases using AI, whole slide imaging (WSI), or both. Of the 176 studies, 13 met the inclusion criteria. The datasets range from 145 to 964 WSIs, with an overall number of 494 AUS cases ranging from eight to 254. Five studies used convolutional neural networks (CNN), and two used artificial neural networks (ANN). The preparation methods included Romanowsky-stained smears either alone or combined with Papanicolaou-stained or H&amp;E, and Liquid-based cytology (ThinPrep). The scanner models that were used for scanning the slides varied, including Leica/Aperio, Alyuda Neurointelligence Cupertino, and PANNORAMIC\u2122 Desk Scanner. Classifiers used include Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN), Two-Layer Feedforward Neural Networks (2L-FFNN), Classifier Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA), Visual Geometry Group 11 (VGG11), Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), Extra Trees Classifier (ETC), YOLOv4, EfficientNetV2-L, Back-Propagation on Multi-Layer Perceptron, and MobileNetV2. Although cytopathology is late in adopting AI, available studies have shown promising results in differentiating between thyroid lesions, including AUS/FLUS. Our review showed that AI can be especially effective in removing sources of errors such as subjective assessment, variation in staining, and algorithms. CNN has been successful in processing WSI data and identifying diagnostic features with minimal human supervision. ANNs excelled in integrating structured clinical data with image-derived features, particularly when paired with WSI, enhancing diagnostic accuracy for indeterminate thyroid lesions. A combined approach using both CNN and ANN can take advantage of their strengths. While AI and WSI integration shows promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing uncertainty in indeterminate thyroid cytology, challenges such as the lack of standardization need to be addressed. This review highlights the heterogeneity in study designs, dataset sizes, and evaluation metrics. Future studies should focus on hybrid AI models, CNNs, ANNs, and standardized methodologies to maximize clinical applicability.",

However, realizing this potential requires AI solutions that truly address specific pain points. Here we review 4 use cases in which AI has been applied to small animal veterinary medicine: image analysis, early disease detection, administration support, and disease surveillance. For each of these, we briefly present the current state of the technology and available AI applications. Results show that tangible value creation is heterogeneous across use cases and that availability of accurate and reliable data (eg, in the form of curated electronic health records) is a major limiting factor.",

    "abstract": "Current limitations in implant design often lead to trade-offs between minimally invasive surgery and achieving the desired post-implantation functionality. Here, we present an artificial intelligence inverse design paradigm for creating deployable implants as planar and tubular thermal mechanical metamaterials (thermo-metamaterials). These thermo-metamaterial implants exhibit tunable mechanical properties and volume change in response to temperature changes, enabling minimally invasive and personalized surgery. We begin by generating a large database of corrugated thermo-metamaterials with various cell structures and bending stiffnesses. An artificial intelligence inverse design model is subsequently developed by integrating an evolutionary algorithm with a neural network. This model allows for the automatic determination of the optimal microstructure for thermo-metamaterials with desired performance,i.e., target bending stiffness. We validate this approach by designing patient-specific spinal fusion implants and tracheal stents. The results demonstrate that the deployable thermo-metamaterial implants can achieve over a 200% increase in volume or cross-sectional area in their fully deployed states. Finally, we propose a broader vision for a clinically informed artificial intelligence design process that prioritizes biocompatibility, feasibility, and precision simultaneously for the development of high-performing and clinically viable implants. The feasibility of this proposed vision is demonstrated using a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to customize thermo-metamaterial implants based on clinically relevant factors.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension underpins significant global morbidity and mortality. Early lifestyle intervention and treatment are effective in reducing adverse outcomes. Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiography (AI-ECG) has been shown to identify a broad spectrum of subclinical disease and may be useful for predicting incident hypertension.\nTo develop an AI-ECG risk estimator (AIRE) to predict incident hypertension (AIRE-HTN) and stratify risk for hypertension-associated adverse outcomes.\nThis was a development and external validation prognostic cohort study conducted at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, Massachusetts, a secondary care setting. External validation was conducted in the UK Biobank (UKB), a UK-based volunteer cohort. AIRE-HTN was trained and tested to predict incident hypertension using routinely collected ECGs from patients at BIDMC between 2014 and 2023. The algorithm was then evaluated to risk stratify patients for hypertension- associated adverse outcomes and externally validated on UKB data between 2014 and 2022 for both incident hypertension and risk stratification.\nAIRE-HTN, which uses a residual convolutional neural network architecture with a discrete-time survival loss function, was trained to predict incident hypertension.\nAIRE-HTN was trained on 1\u202f163\u202f401 ECGs from 189\u202f539 patients (mean [SD] age, 57.7 [18.7] years; 98\u202f747 female [52.1%]) at BIDMC. A total of 19\u202f423 BIDMC patients composed the test set and were evaluated for incident hypertension. From the UKB, AIRE-HTN was tested on 65\u202f610 ECGs from same number of participants (mean [SD] age, 65.4 [7.9] years; 33\u202f785 female [51.5%]). A total of 35\u202f806 UKB patients were evaluated for incident hypertension. AIRE-HTN predicted incident hypertension (BIDMC: n\u2009=\u20096446 [33%] events; C index, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.69-0.71; UKB: n\u2009=\u20091532 [4%] events; C index, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.69-0.71). Performance was maintained in individuals without left ventricular hypertrophy and those with normal ECGs (C indices, 0.67-0.72). AIRE-HTN was significantly additive to existing clinical risk factors in predicting incident hypertension (continuous net reclassification index, BIDMC: 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33-0.53; UKB: 0.32; 95% CI, 0.23-0.37). In adjusted Cox models, AIRE-HTN score was an independent predictor of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio [HR] per standard deviation, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.67-3.00) and stratified risk for heart failure (HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 2.22-3.04), myocardial infarction (HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 2.55-3.83), ischemic stroke (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11-1.37), and chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.68-2.12), beyond traditional risk factors.\nResults suggest that AIRE-HTN, an AI-ECG model, can predict incident hypertension and identify patients at risk of hypertension-related adverse events, beyond conventional clinical risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Women are disproportionately affected by chronic autoimmune diseases (AD) like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Traditional evaluations often underestimate the associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke risk in women having AD. Vitamin D deficiency increases susceptibility to these conditions. CVD risk prediction in AD can benefit from surrogate biomarker for coronary artery disease (CAD), such as carotid ultrasound. Due to non-linearity in the CVD risk stratification, we use artificial intelligence-based system using AD biomarkers and carotid ultrasound. Investigate the relationship between AD and CVD/stroke markers including autoantibody-influenced plaque load. Second, to study the surrogate biomarkers for the CAD and gather radiomics-based features such as carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), and plaque area (PA). Third and final, explore the automated CVD/stroke risk identification using advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) paradigms. Analysed biomarker data from women with AD, including carotid ultrasonography imaging, clinical parameters, autoantibody profiles, and vitamin D levels. Proposed artificial intelligence (AI) models to predict CVD/stroke risk accurately in AD for women. There is a strong association between AD duration and elevated cIMT/PA, with increased CVD risk linked to higher rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs) levels. AI models outperformed conventional methods by integrating imaging data and disorder-specific factors. Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial for managing CVD/stroke in women with chronic autoimmune diseases. AI-based assisted risk stratification methods may improve treatment decision-making and cardiovascular outcomes.",

    "abstract": "To investigate integrating an artificial intelligence (AI) system into diagnostic breast ultrasound (US) for improved performance.\nSeventy suspicious breast mass lesions (53 malignant and 17 benign) from seventy women who underwent diagnostic breast US complemented with shear wave elastography, US-guided core needle biopsy and verified histopathology were enrolled. Two radiologists, one with 15 years of experience and the other with one year of experience, evaluated the images for breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) scoring. The less-experienced radiologist re-evaluated the images with the guidance of a commercial AI system and the maximum elasticity from shear wave elastography. The BI-RADS scorings were processed to determine diagnostic performance and malignancy detections.\nThe experienced reader demonstrated superior performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.888 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.793-0.983], indicating high diagnostic accuracy. In contrast, the Koios decision support (DS) system achieved an AUC of 0.693 (95% CI: 0.562-0.824). The less-experienced reader, guided by both Koios and elasticity, showed an AUC of 0.679 (95% CI: 0.534-0.823), while Koios alone resulted in an AUC of 0.655 (95% CI: 0.512-0.799). Without any guidance, the less-experienced reader exhibited the lowest performance, with an AUC of 0.512 (95% CI: 0.352-0.672). The experienced reader had a sensitivity of 98.1%, specificity of 58.8%, positive predictive value of 88.1%, negative predictive value of 90.9%, and overall accuracy of 88.6%. The Koios DS showed a sensitivity of 92.5%, specificity of 35.3%, and an accuracy of 78.6%. The less-experienced reader, when guided by both Koios and elasticity, achieved a sensitivity of 92.5%, specificity of 23.5%, and an accuracy of 75.7%. When guided by Koios alone, the less-experienced reader had a sensitivity of 90.6%, specificity of 17.6%, and an accuracy of 72.9%. Lastly, the less-experienced reader without any guidance showed a sensitivity of 84.9%, specificity of 17.6%, and an accuracy of 68.6%.\nDiagnostic evaluation of the suspicious masses on breast US images largely depends on experience, with experienced readers showing good performances. AI-based guidance can help improve lower performances, and using the elasticity metric may further improve the performances of less experienced readers. This type of guidance may reduce unnecessary biopsies by increasing the detection rate for malignant lesions and deliver significant benefits for routine clinical practice in underserved areas where experienced readers may not be available.",

    "abstract": "A significant area of computer science called artificial intelligence (AI) is successfully applied to the analysis of intricate biological data and the extraction of substantial associations from datasets for a variety of biomedical uses. AI has attracted significant interest in biomedical research due to its features: (i) better patient care through early diagnosis and detection; (ii) enhanced workflow; (iii) lowering medical errors; (v) lowering medical costs; (vi) reducing morbidity and mortality; (vii) enhancing performance; (viii) enhancing precision; and (ix) time efficiency. Quantitative metrics are crucial for evaluating AI implementations, providing insights, enabling informed decisions, and measuring the impact of AI-driven initiatives, thereby enhancing transparency, accountability, and overall impact. The implementation of AI in biomedical fields faces challenges such as ethical and privacy concerns, lack of awareness, technology unreliability, and professional liability. A brief discussion is given of the AI techniques, which include Virtual screening (VS), DL, ML, Hidden Markov models (HMMs), Neural networks (NNs), Generative models (GMs), Molecular dynamics (MD), and Structure-activity relationship (SAR) models. The study explores the application of AI in biomedical fields, highlighting its enhanced predictive accuracy, treatment efficacy, diagnostic efficiency, faster decision-making, personalised treatment strategies, and precise medical interventions.",

The pathophysiology of preeclampsia is incompletely understood. Artificial intelligence, especially machine learning with its capability to identify patterns in complex data, has the potential to revolutionize preeclampsia research. These data-driven techniques can improve early diagnosis, personalize risk assessment, uncover the disease's molecular basis, optimize treatments, and enable remote monitoring. This brief review discusses the recent applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in preeclampsia management and research, including the improvements these approaches have brought, along with their challenges and limitations.",

    "abstract": "In 2019, COVID-19 began one of the greatest public health challenges in history, reaching pandemic status the following year. Systems capable of predicting individuals at higher risk of progressing to severe forms of the disease could optimize the allocation and direction of resources. In this work, we evaluated the performance of different Machine Learning algorithms when predicting clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, using clinical data from hospital admission alone. This data was collected during a prospective, multicenter cohort that followed patients with respiratory syndrome during the pandemic. We aimed to predict which patients would present mild cases of COVID-19 and which would develop severe cases. Severe cases were defined as those requiring access to the Intensive Care Unit, endotracheal intubation, or even progressing to death. The system achieved an accuracy of 80%, with Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 91%, Positive Predictive Value of 87% and Negative Predictive Value of 82%. Considering that only data from hospital admission was used, and that this data came from low-cost clinical examination and laboratory testing, the low false positive rate and acceptable accuracy observed shows that it is feasible to implement prediction systems based on artificial intelligence as an effective triage method.",

    "abstract": "Pes planus (flatfoot) and pes cavus (high arch foot) are common foot deformities, often requiring clinical and radiographic assessment for diagnosis and potential subsequent management. Traditional diagnostic methods, while effective, pose limitations such as cost, radiation exposure, and accessibility, particularly in underserved areas.\nTo develop deep learning algorithms that detect and classify such deformities using smartphone cameras.\nAn algorithm that integrated a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) into a smartphone camera was utilized to detect pes planus and pes cavus deformities. This case control study was conducted at a tertiary hospital with participants recruited from two orthopaedic foot and ankle clinics. The CNN was trained and tested using photographs of the medial aspect of participants' feet, taken under standardized conditions. Participants included subjects with standard foot alignment, pes planus, or pes cavus determined by an expert clinician using the foot posture index. The model's performance was assessed in comparison to clinical assessment and radiographic measurements, specifically lateral tarsal-first metatarsal angle and calcaneal inclination angle.\nThe CNN model demonstrated high accuracy in diagnosing both pes planus and pes cavus, with an optimized area under the curve of 0.90 for pes planus and 0.90 for pes cavus. It showed a specificity and sensitivity of 84% and 87% for pes planus detection, respectively; and 97% and 70% for pes cavus, respectively. The model's prediction correlated moderately with radiographic lateral Meary's angle measurements, indicating the model's excellent reliability in assessing food arch deformity (\nThis study highlights the potential of using a smartphone-based CNN model as a screening tool that is reliable and accessible for the detection of pes planus and pes cavus deformities, which is especially beneficial for underserved communities and patients with pain generated by subtle foot arch deformities.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in women. Although the important role of metabolism in the molecular pathogenesis of BC is known, there is still a need for robust metabolomic biomarkers and predictive models that will enable the detection and prognosis of BC. This study aims to identify targeted metabolomic biomarker candidates based on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for the specific detection of BC.\nData obtained after targeted metabolomics analyses using plasma samples from BC patients (n = 102) and healthy controls (n = 99) were used. Machine learning (ML) models based on raw data were developed, then feature selection methods were applied, and the results were compared. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), an XAI method, was used to clinically explain the decisions of the optimal model in BC prediction.\nThe results revealed that variable selection increased the performance of ML models in BC classification, and the optimal model was obtained with the logistic regression (LR) classifier after support vector machine (SVM)-SHAP-based feature selection. SHAP annotations of the LR model revealed that Leucine, isoleucine, L-alloisoleucine, norleucine, and homoserine acids were the most important potential BC diagnostic biomarkers. Combining the identified metabolite markers provided robust BC classification measures with precision, recall, and specificity of 89.50%, 88.38%, and 83.67%, respectively.\nIn conclusion, this study adds valuable information to the discovery of BC biomarkers and underscores the potential of targeted metabolomics-based diagnostic advances in the management of BC.",

    "abstract": "This review aimed to explore the scientific literature concerning the methodologies and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of endodontics. The findings may equip dentists with the necessary technical knowledge to understand the opportunities presented by AI.\nArticles published between 1992 and 2023 were retrieved through an electronic search of Medline via the PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The search, which was limited to articles published in English, aimed to identify relevant studies by employing the following keywords: \"artificial intelligence,\" \"machine learning,\" \"deep learning,\" \"endodontic,\" \"root canal treatment,\" and \"radiography.\" Ultimately, 71 studies that addressed the application of AI in endodontics were selected.\nNumerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of AI applications in endodontics. These uses encompass the identification of root fractures and periapical lesions, assessment of working length, investigation of root canal system anatomy, prediction of retreatment success, and evaluation of dental pulp stem cell viability.\nAI technology is poised to advance aspects of endodontics including scheduling, patient care, management of drug-drug interactions, prognostic diagnosis, and the emerging area of robotic endodontic surgery. AI methods have demonstrated accuracy and precision in the identification, assessment, and prediction of diseases. Thus, AI can significantly improve endodontic diagnosis and treatment, increasing the overall efficacy of endodontic therapy.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and mixed reality (MR), within human-computer interaction (HCI), are rapidly redefining areas of healthcare by introducing new approaches to patient care and clinical education. This editorial explores how these technologies, through Extended Mind Theory, enhance mental health treatment and medical training. AI-powered virtual therapists, using natural language processing and predictive analytics, provide accessible, personalized mental health support, allowing for remote and immersive therapy. In MR environments, patients with anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or phobias can safely engage in therapeutic exercises, confronting fears in controlled, virtual settings. In clinical education, AI and MR deliver adaptive, immersive training tools that respond to individual needs, enabling repeated practice in a risk-free environment. These tools improve skills and build confidence by simulating high-stakes scenarios like emergency response, with HCI principles ensuring user-friendly and experiential learning. Ethical considerations, including data security and transparency, are essential as these tools integrate into healthcare. This blend of AI, MR, and HCI redefines healthcare boundaries, extending cognitive and emotional support into virtual spaces, enhancing both patient care and clinical training.",

    "abstract": "The objectives of this study are to compare the accuracy of warm ischemia times (WITs) derived by a surgical artificial intelligence (AI) software to those documented in surgeon operative reports during partial nephrectomy procedures and to assess the potential of this technology in evaluating postoperative renal function.\nA surgical AI software (Theator Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was used to capture and analyse videos of partial nephrectomies performed between October 2023 and April 2024. The platform utilized computer vision algorithms to detect clamp placement and removal, enabling precise WIT measurement. Expert-reviewed surgical videos served as the ground truth.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the ecological footprint awareness and ecological intelligence levels of nurses working in a hospital.\nThis descriptive study was conducted with 290 nurses working in a hospital. The study data were collected using a descriptive questionnaire, \"Ecological Intelligence Scale\", and \"Ecological Footprint Awareness Scale\". Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS v23. The conformity of the data to the normal distribution was examined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Pearson Correlation analysis and Regression analysis were used to determine and explain the relationships between variables.\nThe mean age of the nurses in the study was 34.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.53 and 85.9% were female. A statistically significant relationship was found between nurses' membership in an environmental association or organization (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.192; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and their reaction to individuals who pollute the environment (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.208; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and ecological intelligence. In addition, a statistically significant relationship was found between nurses' gender (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.121; p\u00a0=\u00a00.041) and their reaction to individuals who pollute the environment and ecological footprint awareness (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.165; p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). As the age and professional seniority of nurses increases, their ecological footprint awareness also increases (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nAs the age and working years of nurses increase, their awareness of ecological footprint also increases. As nurses' ecological intelligence increases, their awareness of their ecological footprint also increases. Female nurses have higher ecological footprint awareness than male nurses.",

    "abstract": "This theoretical paper offers an in-depth examination of the intersection between Theory of Mind (ToM) and artificial intelligence (AI), drawing on developmental psychology and philosophical analysis. By investigating the key developmental stages at which children begin to understand that others have distinct mental states, the paper provides a framework for assessing the cognitive boundaries of AI systems. It critically interrogates the pervasive human inclination to anthropomorphize machines, particularly through the attribution of complex mental states like \"knowing,\" \"thinking,\" or \"believing\" to AI entities that lack subjective experience. The paper argues that AI, while capable of simulating cognitive processes, operates without the conscious awareness that defines human cognition, raising profound epistemological and ethical questions. It explores the broader implications of this projection for society, considering how our conceptualization of AI affects both technological development and social structures. Ultimately, this interdisciplinary inquiry calls for a more nuanced understanding of the distinctions between human and machine cognition, advocating for responsible approaches to AI as its capabilities evolve.",

    "abstract": "The 2030 French Innovation Healthcare national plan defined \"Digital Healthcare\" as one of its priority. The deployment of digital pathology and artificial intelligence fits perfectly into this framework. Therefore we evaluated the pathologist's interest in those fields by conducting an online survey among members of the French Society of Pathology, mainly composed of senior pathologists and trainees (n=2301). We collected 123 answers originating nationwide and representative of all status of practice. A heavy majority of participants (83%) declared themselves \"interested or very interested\" in digital transition and AI. Twenty-six percent of participants took part in academic research projects and 20% in industrial research projects. With digital pathology becoming increasingly common nationwide, there is a growing interest of pathologists in the development and validation of AI algorithms. In order to support this dynamic, a commission for research on artificial intelligence has been created under the authority of the French Society of Pathology.",

    "abstract": "To assess whether an artificial intelligence (AI)-based reassurance-call can inform patients about potential complications and provides reassurance following a prostate biopsy.\nFrom October 2022 to December 2023, 42 patients aged 40 to 70 years undergoing their first prostate biopsy were recruited. The 'Reassurance-call' service was utilized to inform and monitor patients for complications. Participants were randomized into three groups: AI-assisted Reassurance-call service (Group 1), human-assisted Reassurance-call service (Group 2), and no call (Group 3). The primary outcome measured was patient satisfaction with the Reassurance-call service, assessed using a Likert scale. Secondary outcomes included satisfaction with complication management and anxiety levels, evaluated using the Likert scale, visual analog scale (VAS), and the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI).\nSatisfaction with Reassurance-call averaged 4.20 (standard deviation [SD] 0.56) for Group 1 and 4.71 (SD 0.47) for Group 2, showing a statistically significant difference. Satisfaction regarding complication management using Likert scale was 4.13 (SD 0.52) for Group 1, 4.43 (SD 0.76) for Group 2, and 3.79 (SD 0.80) for Group 3 with no statistically significant differences. Satisfaction regarding complication management using VAS averaged 8.33 (SD 1.23) for Group 1, 8.57 (SD 1.45) for Group 2, and 7.07 (SD 1.86) for Group 3, indicating significant differences. Anxiety levels using STAI averaged 40.00 (SD 10.54) for Group 1, 39.14 (SD 8.29) for Group 2, and 35.00 (SD 9.46) for Group 3, showing no significant differences. Anxiety levels using VAS averaged 5.07 (SD 2.79) for Group 1, 2.21 (SD 2.64) for Group 2, and 3.50 (SD 2.28) for Group 3, with significant differences observed.\nAI demonstrated potential in enhancing patient reassurance and managing complications post-prostate biopsy, although human interaction proved superior in certain aspects. Further studies with larger cohorts are necessary to verify the effectiveness of AI-based tools.",

    "abstract": "This preliminary study tested whether non-invasive, remote Elastic Scattering Spectroscopy (ESS) measurements obtained in the oral cavity can be used as a proxy to accurately differentiate between patients with laryngeal cancer versus laryngeal leukoplakia.\n20 patients with laryngeal lesions [cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a010),leukoplakia (n\u00a0=\u00a010)] were clinically assessed and categorized by otolaryngologists per standard clinical practice. Patient demographics of age, race, sex, and smoking history were collected. A machine-learning artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm was applied to classify patients using ESS spectra of patients with benign laryngeal leukoplakia or laryngeal cancer. Specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), F1, and area-under-the-curve (AUC) were calculated. Additional algorithms stratified spectral data by sub-anatomical site and smoking status to explore diagnostic capability.\nOverall, the algorithm had a sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a074\u00a0%, specificity\u00a0=\u00a040\u00a0%, PPV\u00a0=\u00a051\u00a0%, NPV\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0%, F1\u00a0=\u00a00.61 and AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.65. When stratifying by former and active smokers, algorithm sensitivities increased to 85\u00a0% and 77\u00a0%. Analysis by sub-anatomic location yielded an AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.77 for lateral tongue, and when stratified by (former/current) smoking status, demonstrated AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.94 and 0.83, sensitivities\u00a0=\u00a098\u00a0% and 76\u00a0%, and specificities\u00a0=\u00a085\u00a0% and 86\u00a0%. Algorithm output from the mucosal lip yielded sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a089\u00a0%, specificity\u00a0=\u00a088\u00a0%, PPV\u00a0=\u00a083\u00a0%, and NPV\u00a0=\u00a092\u00a0% in former smokers.\nThis pilot study demonstrated ESS technology coupled with AI-assisted statistical modeling, could differentiate between patients with laryngeal leukoplakia versus cancer with good precision, especially with smoking status and anatomic subclassification. If ESS can be utilized in the oral cavity as a non-invasive screening tool for laryngeal cancer, it would greatly facilitate early detection in specialized/non-specialized clinics, and under-resourced regions.",

    "abstract": "Achieving histological remission is a desirable emerging treatment target in ulcerative colitis (UC), yet its assessment is challenging due to high inter- and intraobserver variability, reliance on experts, and lack of standardization. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise in addressing these issues. This systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression evaluated the AI's performance in assessing histological remission and compared it with that of pathologists.\nWe searched Medline/PubMed and Scopus databases from inception to September 2024. We included studies on AI models assessing histological activity in UC, with or without comparison to pathologists. Pooled performance metrics were calculated: sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV), observed agreement, and F1 score. A pairwise meta-analysis compared AI and pathologists, while sub-meta-analysis and meta-regression evaluated heterogeneity and factors influencing AI performance.\nTwelve studies met the inclusion criteria. AI models exhibited strong performance with a pooled sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.80-0.88), specificity 0.87 (0.84-0.91), PPV 0.90 (0.87-0.92), NPV 0.80 (0.71-0.88), observed agreement 0.85 (0.82-0.89), and F1 score 0.85 (0.82-0.89). AI models demonstrated no significant differences with pathologists for specificity, observed agreement, and F1 score, while they were outperformed by pathologists for sensitivity and NPV. AI models for the adult population were linked to reduced heterogeneity and enhanced AI performance at meta-regression.\nAI shows significant potential for assessing histological remission in UC and performs comparably to pathologists. Future research should focus on standardized, large-scale studies to minimize heterogeneity and support widespread AI implementation in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a severe condition associated with numerous cardiovascular complications, including heart failure. The complex biological and morphological relationship between OSA and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) poses challenges in predicting adverse cardiovascular outcomes. While artificial intelligence (AI) has shown potential for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke risks in other conditions, there is a lack of detailed, bias-free, and compressed AI models for ASCVD and stroke risk stratification in OSA patients. This study aimed to address this gap by proposing three hypotheses: (i) a strong relationship exists between OSA and ASCVD/stroke, (ii) deep learning (DL) can stratify ASCVD/stroke risk in OSA patients using surrogate carotid imaging, and (iii) including OSA risk as a covariate with cardiovascular risk factors can improve CVD risk stratification.\nThe study employed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) search strategy, yielding 191 studies that link OSA with coronary, carotid, and aortic atherosclerotic vascular diseases. This research investigated the link between OSA and CVD, explored DL solutions for OSA detection, and examined the role of DL in utilizing carotid surrogate biomarkers by saving costs. Lastly, we benchmark our strategy against previous studies.\n(i) This study found that CVD and OSA are indirectly or directly related. (ii) DL models demonstrated significant potential in improving OSA detection and proved effective in CVD risk stratification using carotid ultrasound as a biomarker. (iii) Additionally, DL was shown to be useful for CVD risk stratification in OSA patients; (iv) There are important AI attributes such as AI-bias, AI-explainability, AI-pruning, and AI-cloud, which play an important role in CVD risk for OSA patients.\nDL provides a powerful tool for CVD risk stratification in OSA patients. These results can promote several recommendations for developing unique, bias-free, and explainable AI algorithms for predicting ASCVD and stroke risks in patients with OSA.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging enables a one-stop assessment of heart structure and function. Artificial intelligence (AI) can simplify and automate work flows and improve image post-processing speed and diagnostic accuracy; thus, it greatly affects many aspects of CMR. This review highlights the application of AI for left heart analysis in CMR, including quality control, image segmentation, and global and regional functional assessment. Most recent research has focused on segmentation of the left ventricular myocardium and blood pool. Although many algorithms have shown a level comparable to that of human experts, some problems, such as poor performance of basal and apical segmentation and false identification of myocardial structure, remain. Segmentation of myocardial fibrosis is another research hotspot, and most patient cohorts of such studies have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Whether the above methods are applicable to other patient groups requires further study. The use of automated CMR interpretation for the diagnosis and prognosis assessment of cardiovascular diseases demonstrates great clinical potential. However, prospective large-scale clinical trials are needed to investigate the real-word application of AI technology in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The growing presence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in our society, particularly in the educational field, is undeniable. This fact has led to various studies on its implications for learning and teaching. However, as with other technological resources, these implications will depend on how teachers use GenAI. Therefore, it is essential to identify teachers' beliefs regarding the use of GenAI for teaching and learning.\nTo this end, a questionnaire was designed and completed by 321 university teachers. This questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first included questions about the participants' demographic information and a Likert scale on teachers' pedagogical beliefs. The second part consisted of a 32-item Likert scale that evaluated teachers' beliefs about the impact of GenAI on their students' learning and their own teaching. These aspects were reflected through items that considered GenAI as either an educational opportunity or a threat.\nThe results showed that, of all the variables analyzed, only pedagogical beliefs and the frequency of previous GenAI use influenced beliefs about GenAI usage. Specifically, teachers with constructivist beliefs saw greater potential in GenAI compared to others. Similarly, teachers who regularly used these technologies had more positive beliefs about their educational use than those who used them sporadically or not at all. Lastly, it was also observed that while teachers valued the positive effects of GenAI on their teaching work, they also considered that its use could be detrimental to the learning processes of their students, making them more superficial.\nThese findings underline the importance of providing teachers with training focused on constructive approaches that enable them to maximize the potential of GenAI in education. In particular, it is crucial to promote teaching practices that, through student-centered GenAI use, foster active and reflective processes in students, aligned with the competencies demanded by today's society.",

    "abstract": "Implementation of behavior therapy for ADHD faces challenges in community settings. We describe development of a community-based implementation model for adolescent ADHD behavior therapy (Supporting Teens' Autonomy Daily; STAND) blended with Motivational Interviewing (MI). A stakeholder-engaged development approach is used based on the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework. Resulting model features include: (a) task-shifting supervision from experts to agency supervisors, (b) holding bi-weekly technical assistance drop-ins to provide training and implementation supports, (c) MI integrity monitoring and feedback by artificial intelligence (AI), (d) AI-generated metrics for STAND content fidelity, (e) digitizing resources (manual, worksheets, tips, videos) on a clinician dashboard, (f) creating visual displays of feedback using badges and graphs, and (g) adding a rapport-building session prior to manualized content. We conducted stakeholder focus groups (",

    "abstract": "Smart cities, artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, and low-carbon building materials are pivotal to public health, environmental sustainability, and green efficiency. Despite their critical importance, understanding public perceptions and attitudes toward these domains remains underexplored. Additionally, the effective use of advanced technologies like convolutional neural networks (CNN) in predicting and promoting low-carbon solutions in construction is gaining attention.\nThis study employs a dual approach: (1) A survey of 200 respondents was conducted to gauge public perceptions and attitudes toward smart cities, AI in medicine, and low-carbon building materials. (2) A CNN model was developed and implemented to predict the performance of low-carbon building materials. The model utilized convolutional and pooling layers to capture local features and spatial information from image datasets, with tasks including image classification and segmentation.\nThe survey results indicate high awareness of smart cities (80%), with 60% associating them with environmental protection and green living. For AI in medicine, 70% of respondents are aware of its applications, but only 45% perceive it as environmentally beneficial. Regarding low-carbon building materials, 60% expressed willingness to pay premium prices, and 65% recognized their positive environmental impact. The CNN model demonstrated high prediction accuracy on both training and validation datasets, effectively aiding in the identification of low-carbon materials and reducing building energy consumption and carbon emissions.\nThe findings highlight significant public awareness and diverse attitudes toward these critical domains, suggesting the need for improved communication and advocacy for AI's environmental benefits. The application of CNN models in the construction industry showcases a promising pathway to enhance material selection efficiency and foster sustainable practices. These insights are essential for aligning public understanding with technological advancements to achieve environmental and public health goals.",

    "abstract": "In the study, we aimed to introduce a formula for measuring the oesophageal total wall thickness area, which could be used for developing an artificial intelligence-based algorithm for the detection of patients whose total wall thickness area exceeds the norms.\nMathematical formulas for measuring the square area of the oesophageal total wall thickness area were introduced and applied. Children were grouped according to their weight in clusters. For each cluster, the range (minimal and maximal value) were established. The measurements were done by using the formula for the area of the circular ring according to the formula A = n (B2-b2); the product of n and subtraction square b (smaller radius) and square B (bigger radius). The basic data for our calculations were derived from papers published by Dalby \nThe square area (in mm\nTotal wall thickness area could be used for monitoring children with eosinophilic oesophagitis and other oesophageal diseases. The method could also be applied for adults. Therefore, it can be a foundation for further progress with applying artificial intelligence algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The manufacturing sector's interest in additive manufacturing (AM) methods is increasing daily. The increase in energy consumption requires optimization of energy consumption in rapid prototyping technology. This study aims to minimize energy consumption with determined production parameters. Four machine learning algorithms are preferred to model the energy consumption of the fused deposition modeling-based 3D printer. The real-time measured test sample data were trained, and the prediction model between the parameters of 3D fabrication and the energy consumption was created. The predicted model was evaluated using five performance criteria. These are mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), ",

    "abstract": "Hyperkalemia can be detected by point-of-care (POC) blood testing and by artificial intelligence- enabled electrocardiography (ECG). These 2 methods of detecting hyperkalemia have not been compared.\nTo determine the accuracy of POC and ECG potassium measurements for hyperkalemia detection in patients with critical illness.\nThis retrospective study involved intensive care patients in an academic medical center from October 2020 to September 2021. Patients who had 12-lead ECG, POC potassium measurement, and central laboratory potassium measurement within 1 hour were included. The POC potassium measurements were obtained from arterial blood gas analysis; ECG potassium measurements were calculated by a previously developed deep learning model. Hyperkalemia was defined as a central laboratory potassium measurement of 5.5 mEq/L or greater.\nFifteen patients with hyperkalemia and 252 patients without hyperkalemia were included. The POC and ECG potassium measurements were available about 35 minutes earlier than central laboratory results. Correlation with central laboratory potassium measurement was better for POC testing than for ECG (mean absolute errors of 0.211 mEq/L and 0.684 mEq/L, respectively). For POC potassium measurement, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to detect hyperkalemia was 0.933, sensitivity was 73.3%, and specificity was 98.4%. For ECG potassium measurement, AUC was 0.884, sensitivity was 93.3%, and specificity was 63.5%.\nThe ECG potassium measurement, with its high sensitivity and coverage rate, may be used initially and followed by POC potassium measurement for rapid detection of life-threatening hyperkalemia.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy (DA) for colorectal adenomas (CRA), screened by fecal immunochemical test (FIT), using five artificial intelligence (AI) models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM). These models were tested together with clinical features categorized as low-risk (lowR) and high-risk (highR).\nThe colorectal neoplasia (CRN) screening cohort of 5,090 patients included 222 CRA patients and 264 non-CRA patients. Three consecutive fecal samples from each individual were analyzed by two fecal occult blood (FOB) assays. Five AI models including clinical features of CRN patients and CV test results were used to test the DA for CRA measured by receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves.\nIn conventional ROC analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) values for different AI models ranged from 0.659 and 0.691 (for AIs with LR and SVM), while the highest AUC values were reached by NN, RF, and GBM models (0.809, 0.840, and 0.858, respectively). In the hierarchical summary ROC (HSROC) analysis, the AUC values were as follows: i) with lowR variables, AUC=0.508; ii) with highR variables, AUC=0.566 and iii) with all AI models, AUC= 0.789. The differences in AUC values were: between i) and ii) p=0.008; between i) and iii) p<0.0001 and between ii) and iii) p<0.0001.\nIn detection of CRA, the AI models proved to be superior to the diagnostic features without AI. This is the first study to report that DA in the diagnosis of CRA can be enhanced by AI models that include clinical data of the patients and results of FIT test.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to examine neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses' perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly language models, and their impact on nursing practices.\nAI is rapidly spreading in healthcare, transforming nursing practice. Understanding the role of AI in NICUs in the discharge process is crucial for understanding nurses' perceptions of these technologies.\nThe qualitative, phenomenological study used semi-structured interviews. Data were collected in a public hospital in Gaziantep from January to June 2024. Fifteen NICU nurses participated. Data were analyzed using content analysis.\nMost nurses found AI to be a valuable tool for saving time and simplifying information delivery in clinical processes. However, concerns were raised about AI potentially reducing human interaction and weakening the use of professional judgment. Serious concerns about AI's reliability and ethical implications were also expressed.\nAI is considered a potentially supportive tool in nursing practice, but its integration must consider the ethical implications and impact on the use of professional judgment. Nursing is based on human interactions and AI should be considered an additive tool to enhance care.\nAI integration in nursing requires careful and balanced implementation. Future research should delve deeper into the ethical dimensions of AI and its long-term effects on nursing practices.",

    "abstract": "Gliomas are the most prevalent form of primary brain tumours. Recently, targeting the PD-1 pathway with immunotherapies has shown promise as a novel glioma treatment. However, not all patients experience long-lasting benefits, underscoring the necessity to discover reliable biomarkers for predicting treatment outcomes. This study applied a range of advanced artificial intelligence methods to identify a new biomarker linked to the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in glioma patients. Through an extensive analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing and bulk transcriptomic data from over 3000 patients, the gene SLFN12 emerged as a significant and independent predictor of immunotherapy response. Our results indicate that elevated SLFN12 expression is associated with worse overall survival across various glioma cohorts. Notably, we found that patients with high SLFN12 levels are less likely to respond favourably to anti-PD-1 treatment, positioning SLFN12 as a clinically valuable biomarker for personalised treatment decisions. Functional studies revealed that SLFN12 is involved in key immune-related pathways, shedding light on its potential role in altering the tumour microenvironment and impacting immunotherapy outcomes. Additional laboratory experiments confirmed the role of SLFN12 in promoting glioma cell proliferation, migration and macrophage recruitment. In summary, this study identifies SLFN12 as a novel biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response in glioma patients, offering new insights for precision immunotherapy approaches.",

    "abstract": "Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a common cause of drug-resistant focal epilepsy but can be challenging to detect visually on magnetic resonance imaging. Three artificial intelligence models for automated FCD detection are publicly available (MAP18, deepFCD, MELD) but have only been compared on single-center data. Our first objective is to compare them on independent multicenter test data. Additionally, we train and compare three new models and make them publicly available.\nWe retrospectively collected FCD cases from four epilepsy centers. We chose three novel models that take two-dimensional (2D) slices (2D-nnUNet), 2.5D slices (FastSurferCNN), and large 3D patches (3D-nnUNet) as inputs and trained them on a subset of Bonn data. As core evaluation metrics, we used voxel-level Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), cluster-level F\nWe collected 329 subjects, 244 diagnosed with FCD (27.7\u2009\u00b1\u200914.4\u2009years old, 54% male) and 85 healthy controls (7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4\u2009years old, 51% female). We used 118 subjects for model training and kept the remaining subjects as an independent test set. 3D-nnUNet achieved the highest F\nThis study shows the variance in performance for FCD detection models in a multicenter dataset. The two models with 3D input data showed the highest sensitivity. The 2D models performed worse than all other models, suggesting that FCD detection requires 3D data. The greatly improved precision of 3D-nnUNet may make it a sensible choice to aid FCD detection.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots, such as ChatGPT, have been shown to mimic individual human behaviour in a wide range of psychological and economic tasks. Do groups of AI chatbots also mimic collective behaviour? If so, artificial societies of AI chatbots may aid social scientific research by simulating human collectives. To investigate this theoretical possibility, we focus on whether AI chatbots natively mimic one commonly observed collective behaviour: homophily, people's tendency to form communities with similar others. In a large simulated online society of AI chatbots powered by large language models (N\u2009=\u200933,299), we find that communities form over time around bots using a common language. In addition, among chatbots that predominantly use English (N\u2009=\u200917,746), communities emerge around bots that post similar content. These initial empirical findings suggest that AI chatbots mimic homophily, a key aspect of human collective behaviour. Thus, in addition to simulating individual human behaviour, AI-powered artificial societies may advance social science research by allowing researchers to simulate nuanced aspects of collective behaviour.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a linked simulation optimization (SO) model is presented for identification of groundwater contaminant sources. The SO model consists of two steps namely, simulation and optimization. The simulation step entails developing a groundwater contaminant transport model in which the advection-dispersion-reaction equation (ADRE) is solved for predicting the concentration of the contaminant. The system parameters (hydraulic conductivity, dispersivity, etc.) and control variables (pumping, recharge, etc.,) are given as model inputs. A meshless technique called the meshless Local Radial Point Interpolation Method (LRPIM) is employed to solve the contaminant transport equation. The simulation model is linked with three different swarm intelligence-based optimization models namely, teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO), grey wolf optimization (GWO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to form three SO models namely LRPIM-PSO, LRPIM-GWO and LRPIM-TLBO. The SO model minimizes the difference between the predicted and observed concentrations to determine the unknown source locations and release histories. The applicability of the developed SO models for source identification (SI) is demonstrated with a hypothetical and real aquifer problems to identify the groundwater contaminant sources. All the 3 models are able to locate the sources and release histories satisfactorily. However, the LRPIM-TLBO has been found to be more accurate followed by LRPIM-PSO and LRPIM-GWO.",

    "abstract": "Despite cystoscopy plays an important role in bladder tumors diagnosis, it often falls short in flat cancerous tissue and minuscule satellite lesions. It can easily lead to a missed diagnosis by the urologist, which can lead to a swift tumor regrowth following transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT). Therefore, we developed a deep learning-based intelligent diagnosis system for early bladder cancer to improve the identification rate of early bladder tumors.\nVideo data from 273 bladder cancer patients who underwent TURBT at Zhongnan Hospital were collected. The dataset was carefully annotated by urologists to clearly define tumor boundaries. Subsequently, we developed a new bladder tumor segmentation network (BTS-Net) based on transformer to accurately diagnose early-stage bladder cancer lesions.\nOur experiments demonstrate that the BTS-Net we developed has outperformed other method on the external B validation dataset, achieving a MPrecision of 91.39%, a MRecall of 95.71%, a MIoU of 88.18% and an F1-score of 93.18%. The BTS-Net showed high accuracy with real-time processing speed at 23 fps.\nMissed detection of satellite lesions in early bladder tumors often leads to tumor recurrence. Our BTS-Net is capable of segmenting all potential satellite lesions in surgical videos, without the need for complex professional equipment. This AI-assisted diagnosis system has the potential to improve surgical outcomes by ensuring comprehensive treatment of all tumor-related areas during TURBT.",

    "abstract": "The increasing development of technology has led to the increase of digital data in various fields, such as medication-related texts. Sentiment Analysis (SA) in medication is essential to give clinicians insights into patients' feedback about the treatment procedure. Therefore, this study intends to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to predict patients' sentiments. This study used a large medication review dataset to perform a SA of medications. Three scenarios were considered for classification, including two, three, and ten classes. The Word2Vec algorithm and pre-trained word embeddings, including the general and clinical domains, were utilized in model development. Seven Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models were developed for various scenarios. The best hyperparameters for all models were fine-tuned. Moreover, two ensemble learning models were developed from the proposed ML and DL models. For the first time, a technique was implemented to interpret the results for explainability and interpretability. The results showed that the developed deep ensemble model (DL_ENS), using PubMed and PMC, as pre-trained word embedding representation, achieved the best results, with accuracy and F1-Score of 92.96% and 92.27% in two classes, 92.18% and 88.50 in three classes, and 90.31% and 67.07% in ten classes, respectively. Combining DL models and developing a DL_ENS with clinical domain pre-trained word embedding representation can accurately predict classes and scores of patients' sentiments about medications compared to previous studies on the same dataset. Due to the transparency in decision-making, our DL_ENS model can be used as an auxiliary tool to help clinicians prescribe medications.",

    "abstract": "With breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in academic research has increased tremendously. Models such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) are used by researchers in literature review, abstract screening, and manuscript drafting. However, these models also present the attendant challenge of providing ethically questionable scientific information. Our study provides a snapshot of global researchers' perception of current trends and future impacts of LLMs in research. Using a cross-sectional design, we surveyed 226 medical and paramedical researchers from 59 countries across 65 specialties, trained in the Global Clinical Scholars' Research Training certificate program of Harvard Medical School between 2020 and 2024. Majority (57.5%) of these participants practiced in an academic setting with a median of 7 (2,18) PubMed Indexed published articles. 198 respondents (87.6%) were aware of LLMs and those who were aware had higher number of publications (p\u2009<\u20090.001). 18.7% of the respondents who were aware (n\u2009=\u200937) had previously used LLMs in publications especially for grammatical errors and formatting (64.9%); however, most (40.5%) did not acknowledge its use in their papers. 50.8% of aware respondents (n\u2009=\u200995) predicted an overall positive future impact of LLMs while 32.6% were unsure of its scope. 52% of aware respondents (n\u2009=\u2009102) believed that LLMs would have a major impact in areas such as grammatical errors and formatting (66.3%), revision and editing (57.2%), writing (57.2%) and literature review (54.2%). 58.1% of aware respondents were opined that journals should allow for use of AI in research and 78.3% believed that regulations should be put in place to avoid its abuse. Seeing the perception of researchers towards LLMs and the significant association between awareness of LLMs and number of published works, we emphasize the importance of developing comprehensive guidelines and ethical framework to govern the use of AI in academic research and address the current challenges.",

    "abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven effective in mRNA delivery, as evidenced by COVID-19 vaccines. Its key ingredient, ionizable lipids, is traditionally optimized by inefficient and costly experimental screening. This study leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual screening to facilitate the rational design of ionizable lipids by predicting two key properties of LNPs, apparent pKa and mRNA delivery efficiency. Nearly 20 million ionizable lipids were evaluated through two iterations of AI-driven generation and screening, yielding three and six new molecules, respectively. In mouse test validation, one lipid from the initial iteration, featuring a benzene ring, demonstrated performance comparable to the control DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3). Notably, all six lipids from the second iteration equaled or outperformed MC3, with one exhibiting efficacy akin to a superior control lipid SM-102. Furthermore, the AI model is interpretable in structure-activity relationships.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma is a pathologically irreversible eye illness in the realm of ophthalmic diseases. Because it is difficult to detect concealed and non-obvious progressive changes, clinical diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma is extremely challenging. At the same time, screening and monitoring for glaucoma disease progression are crucial. Artificial intelligence technology has advanced rapidly in all fields, particularly medicine, thanks to ongoing in-depth study and algorithm extension. Simultaneously, research and applications of machine learning and deep learning in the field of glaucoma are fast evolving. Artificial intelligence, with its numerous advantages, will raise the accuracy and efficiency of glaucoma screening and diagnosis to new heights, as well as significantly cut the cost of diagnosis and treatment for the majority of patients. This review summarizes the relevant applications of artificial intelligence in the screening and diagnosis of glaucoma, as well as reflects deeply on the limitations and difficulties of the current application of artificial intelligence in the field of glaucoma, and presents promising prospects and expectations for the application of artificial intelligence in other eye diseases such as glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "It is known that leprosy is a socially determined disease, but most studies using spatial analysis have not considered the vulnerabilities present in these territories.\nTo measure the association between social vulnerability and the burden of leprosy in the urban space of Cuiab\u00e1.\nEcological study, carried out in Cuiab\u00e1, Brazil. Diagnosed cases of leprosy were surveyed through the Notifiable Diseases Information System, from 2008 to 2018. The spatial scan statistics technique of leprosy cases per each Human Development Unit was applied. Social vulnerability was measured based on the Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI), education level and average per capita income. For the spatial correlation between vulnerability and leprosy, Global and local bivariate Moran's index was used.\n8389 cases of leprosy were georeferenced, the majority being male (58%), 30% of cases were not evaluated for degree of physical disability. One of the spatial scan clusters had a relative risk (RR) of 6.93 (95% CI 6.49-7.4), and another had 1360 cases with RR 1.71 (95% CI 1.62-1.82). The bivariate global autocorrelation of Moran's index for MHDI was 0.579, observing 1 High-High in the East region and 1 in South, for education the index was 0.429, 2 High-High in the East and 1 in the South, and 0.145 for average per capita income, 1 High-High in the East.\nThere was a spatial association between leprosy cases and territories with low MHDI, having a percentage of the population without schooling and/or with low income. The study advances knowledge by presenting characteristics of territories most affected by leprosy, verifying the spatial correlation of the disease with the recurrent socioeconomic characteristics in these territories.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation is a common occurrence in clinical ICU patients and presents significant challenges for patient care and resource allocation. Predicting prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation is crucial for improving patient outcomes, preventing ventilator-associated complications, and guiding targeted clinical interventions. However, specific tools for predicting prolonged mechanical ventilation among ICU patients, particularly those with critical orthopaedic trauma, are currently lacking. The purpose of the study was to establish and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) platform to assess the prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation among patients with critical orthopaedic trauma.\nThis study analyzed 1400 patients with critical orthopaedic trauma who received mechanical ventilation, and the prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation was defined as not weaning from mechanical ventilation for \u2267\u20097 days. Patients were randomly classified into a training cohort and a validation cohort based on the ratio of 8:2. Patients in the training cohort were used to establish models using machine learning techniques, including logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting machine (eXGBM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), whereas patients in the validation cohort were used to validate these models. The prediction performance of these models was evaluated using discrimination and calibration. A scoring system was used to comprehensively assess and compare the prediction performance of the models, based on ten evaluation metrics. External validation of the model was performed in 122 patients with critical orthopaedic trauma from a university teaching hospital. Furthermore, the optimal model was deployed as an AI calculator, which was accessible online, to assess the risk of prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation.\nAmong the developed models, the eXGBM model had the highest score of 50, followed by the LightGBM model (48) and the RF model (37). In detail, the eXGBM model outperformed other models in terms of recall (0.892), Brier score (0.088), log loss (0.291), and calibration slope (0.999), and the model was the second best in terms of area under the curve value (0.949, 95%: 0.933-0.961), accuracy (0.871), F1 score (0.873), and discrimination slope (0.647). The SHAP revealed that the most important five features were respiratory rate, lower limb fracture, glucose, PaO2, and PaCO2. External validation of the eXGBM model also demonstrated favorable prediction performance, with an AUC value of 0.893 (95%CI: 0.819-0.967). The eXGBM model was successfully deployed as an AI platform, which was at https://prolongedmechanicalventilation-lqsfm6ecky6dpd4ybkvohu.streamlit.app/ . By simply clicking the link and inputting features, users were able to obtain the risk of experiencing prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation for individuals. Based on the risk of prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation, patients were stratified into the high-risk or the low-risk groups, and corresponding therapeutic interventions were recommended, accordingly.\nThe AI model shows potential as a valuable tool for stratifying patients with a high risk of prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation. The AI model may offer a promising approach for optimizing patient care and resource allocation in critical care settings.\nNot applicable.",

    "results": "Among the developed models, the eXGBM model had the highest score of 50, followed by the LightGBM model (48) and the RF model (37). In detail, the eXGBM model outperformed other models in terms of recall (0.892), Brier score (0.088), log loss (0.291), and calibration slope (0.999), and the model was the second best in terms of area under the curve value (0.949, 95%: 0.933-0.961), accuracy (0.871), F1 score (0.873), and discrimination slope (0.647). The SHAP revealed that the most important five features were respiratory rate, lower limb fracture, glucose, PaO2, and PaCO2. External validation of the eXGBM model also demonstrated favorable prediction performance, with an AUC value of 0.893 (95%CI: 0.819-0.967). The eXGBM model was successfully deployed as an AI platform, which was at https://prolongedmechanicalventilation-lqsfm6ecky6dpd4ybkvohu.streamlit.app/ . By simply clicking the link and inputting features, users were able to obtain the risk of experiencing prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation for individuals. Based on the risk of prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation, patients were stratified into the high-risk or the low-risk groups, and corresponding therapeutic interventions were recommended, accordingly.",

    "abstract": "The primary objective of this study is to investigate various applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and statistical methodologies for analyzing and managing peritoneal metastases (PM) caused by gastrointestinal cancers.\nRelevant keywords and search criteria were comprehensively researched on PubMed and Google Scholar to identify articles and reviews related to the topic. The AI approaches considered were conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, and the relevant statistical approaches included biostatistics and logistic models.\nThe systematic literature review yielded nearly 30 articles meeting the predefined criteria. Analyses of these studies showed that AI methodologies consistently outperformed traditional statistical approaches. In the AI approaches, DL consistently produced the most precise results, while classical ML demonstrated varied performance but maintained high predictive accuracy. The sample size was the recurring factor that increased the accuracy of the predictions for models of the same type.\nAI and statistical approaches can detect PM developing among patients with gastrointestinal cancers. Therefore, if clinicians integrated these approaches into diagnostics and prognostics, they could better analyze and manage PM, enhancing clinical decision-making and patients' outcomes. Collaboration across multiple institutions would also help in standardizing methods for data collection and allowing consistent results.",

    "abstract": "In this comprehensive review, we delve into the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in refining the application of multi-omics and spatial multi-omics within the realm of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) research. We scrutinized the current landscape of multi-omics and spatial multi-omics technologies, accentuating their combined potential with AI to provide unparalleled insights into the molecular intricacies and spatial heterogeneity inherent to DLBCL. Despite current progress, we acknowledge the hurdles that impede the full utilization of these technologies, such as the integration and sophisticated analysis of complex datasets, the necessity for standardized protocols, the reproducibility of findings, and the interpretation of their biological significance. We proceeded to pinpoint crucial research voids and advocated for a trajectory that incorporates the development of advanced AI-driven data integration and analytical frameworks. The evolution of these technologies is crucial for enhancing resolution and depth in multi-omics studies. We also emphasized the importance of amassing extensive, meticulously annotated multi-omics datasets and fostering translational research efforts to connect laboratory discoveries with clinical applications seamlessly. Our review concluded that the synergistic integration of multi-omics, spatial multi-omics, and AI holds immense promise for propelling precision medicine forward in DLBCL. By surmounting the present challenges and steering towards the outlined futuristic pathways, we can harness these potent investigative tools to decipher the molecular and spatial conundrums of DLBCL. This will pave the way for refined diagnostic precision, nuanced risk stratification, and individualized therapeutic regimens, ushering in a new era of patient-centric oncology care.",

    "abstract": "China's \"14th Five-Year Plan\" proposes the construction of a \"Digital China,\" posing the challenge of digital transformation to coal mining enterprises. It is critical to compare the effectiveness of investing in digital devices with that of human capital. This study establishes a structural equation model based on the 'regulation-situation-behavior' theoretical framework. The model, developed through in-depth empirical analysis of enterprises, captures the relationships between exogenous and endogenous latent variables. The primary factors influencing both the active and passive safety behaviors of coal miners are discussed. The micro-mechanisms of human interaction with digital intelligence equipment are analyzed. The findings indicate that, in terms of overall utility value, investment in Intelligent surveillance management generates a total utility value that is 4.292 times higher than that of investment in team demonstration management. This disparity is primarily attributed to the significant positive impact that Intelligent surveillance management exerts on the active safety behavior of coal miners. Specifically, it influences miners' safety behavior through the dual effects of situational promotion focus and situational prevention focus, whereas team demonstration management solely utilizes situational promotion focus. Additionally, the investigation reveals that miners attach significant importance to the role of instant feedback and continuous monitoring in Intelligent surveillance management. Consequently, coal mining enterprises should prioritize investing in digital intelligence supervision systems with real-time, full-time, and full-coverage capabilities. They should also focus on improving education, publicity, and training related to Intelligent surveillance management. These approaches can effectively enhance the digital, intelligent, safe and sustainable development capabilities of coal mines.",

    "abstract": "Background\u00a0 The generation of innovative research ideas is crucial to advancing the field of medicine. As physicians face increasingly demanding clinical schedules, it is important to identify tools that may expedite the research process. Artificial intelligence may offer a promising solution by enabling the efficient generation of novel research ideas. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using artificial intelligence to build upon existing knowledge by generating innovative research questions.\u00a0 Methods\u00a0 A comparative evaluation study was conducted to assess the ability of AI models to generate novel research questions. The prompt \"research ideas for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis\" was input\u00a0into ChatGPT 3.5, Gemini 1.5, Copilot, and Llama 3. This resulted in an output of several research questions ranging from 10 questions to 14 questions. A keyword-friendly modified version of the AI-generated responses was searched in the PubMed database. Results were limited to manuscripts published in the English language from the year 2000 to the present. Each response was then cross-referenced to the PubMed search results and assigned an originality score of 0-5, with 0 being the most original and 5 being not original at all, by adding one numerical value for each paper already published on the topic. The mean originality scores were calculated manually by summing the originality scores from all the responses from each AI model\u00a0and then dividing that sum by the respective number of prompts generated by the AI. The standard deviation of the originality scores for each AI was calculated using the standard deviation function (STDEV) function in Google Sheets (Google, Mountain View, California). Each AI was also evaluated on its percent novelty, the percentage of total generated responses that yielded an originality score of 0 when searched in PubMed.\u00a0 Results\u00a0 Each AI produced varying numbers of research prompts that were inputted into PubMed. The mean originality scores for ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and Llama were 4.2 \u00b1 1.9, 4.1 \u00b1 1.3, 4.0 \u00b1 1.6, and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7, respectively. Of ChatGPT's 12 prompts, 16.67% were completely novel (no prior research had been conducted on the topic provided by the AI model). 10.00% of Copilot's 10 prompts were completely novel, and 8.33% of Llama's 12 prompts were completely novel. None of Gemini's fourteen responses yielded an originality score of 0.\u00a0 Conclusions\u00a0 Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT, Llama, and Copilot are capable of generating novel ideas in orthopaedics research. As these models continue to evolve and become even more refined with time, physicians and scientists should consider incorporating them when brainstorming and planning their research studies.",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading global cause of morbidity and mortality, underscoring the need for effective cardiovascular risk stratification and preventive strategies. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring, traditionally performed using electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated cardiac computed tomography (CT) scans, has been widely validated as a robust tool for assessing cardiovascular risk. However, its application has been largely limited to high-risk populations due to the costs, technical requirements, and limited accessibility of cardiac CT scans. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have introduced transformative opportunities to extend CAC detection to noncardiac CT scans, such as those performed for lung cancer screening, enabling broader and more accessible cardiovascular screening. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of AI-driven CAC detection, examining various types of AI models for CAC detection, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and U-Net architectures, and exploring the clinical, operational, and ethical implications of incorporating these technologies into routine practice. Technical challenges, including imaging variability, data privacy, and model bias, are discussed alongside essential areas for further research, such as standardization and validation across diverse populations. By leveraging widely available imaging data, AI-enabled CAC detection has the potential to advance preventive cardiology, supporting earlier risk identification, optimizing healthcare resources, and improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is a hot topic in the world of medicine. AI may be useful in identifying and sizing polyps, which influence surveillance intervals. Therefore, we examined polyp size estimation by AI using a survey study. Methods A survey study was performed using a phantom colon model. Eleven videos were produced in the colon phantom using a colonoscope. Gastroenterologists were compared to a new AI system (Argus) for sizing polyps and their impact on surveillance intervals. Results Eleven gastroenterologists completed the survey with a mean age of 51.1 \u00b1 8.1 years and an average of 19.3 \u00b1 10 years of experience. Mean accuracy rates for gastroenterologists were 76% \u00b1 0.1% (range 54-89%) compared to 96% \u00b1 0.05% for Argus. Endoscopists estimated polyp size within \u00b1 1 mm 44 times (36%) versus 9 times (82%) with Argus. Endoscopists' surveillance recommendations were significantly more often inappropriate compared to Argus (34 vs 0). The interval of next colonoscopy was too short for 27 endoscopists (22%) and too long for seven endoscopists (6%). Conclusions AI appears to be more accurate in estimating polyp size than experienced endoscopists. Given the potential impact on surveillance intervals, AI may result in cost savings.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning based applications are thought to impact the practice of healthcare by transforming diagnostic patient management approaches. However, domain knowledge, clinical and coding expertise are likely the biggest challenge and a substantial barrier in developing practical AI models. Most informatics and AI experts are not familiar with the nuances in medicine, and most doctors are not efficient coders. To address this barrier, a few \"no-code\" AI platforms are emerging. They enable medical professionals to create AI models without coding skills. This study examines Teachable Machine\u2122, a no-code AI platform, to classify white blood cells into the five common WBC types. Training data from publicly available datasets were used, and model accuracy was improved by fine-tuning hyperparameters. Sensitivity, precision, and F1 score calculations evaluated model performance, and independent datasets were employed for testing. Several factors that influence the performance of the model were tested. The model achieved 97% accuracy in classifying white blood cells, with high sensitivity and precision. Independent validation supported its potential for further development. This is the first study that demonstrates the value of a free no-code algorithm based AI platforms use in hematopathology using authentic datasets for training. It opens an opportunity for the healthcare professionals to get hands-on experience with AI and to create practical AI models without coding expertise.",

    "abstract": "Atomic simulations aim to understand and predict complex physical phenomena, the success of which relies largely on the accuracy of the potential energy surface description and the efficiency to capture important rare events. LASP software (large-scale atomic simulation with a Neural Network Potential), released in 2018, incorporates the key ingredients to fulfill the ultimate goal of atomic simulations by combining advanced neural network potentials with efficient global optimization methods. This review introduces the recent development of the software along two main streams, namely, higher intelligence and more automation, to solve complex material and reaction problems. The latest version of LASP (LASP 3.7) features the global many-body function corrected neural network (G-MBNN) to improve the PES accuracy with low cost, which achieves a linear scaling efficiency for large-scale atomic simulations. The key functionalities of LASP are updated to incorporate (i) the ASOP and ML-interface methods for finding complex surface and interface structures under grand canonic conditions; (ii) the ML-TS and MMLPS methods to identify the lowest energy reaction pathway. With these powerful functionalities, LASP now serves as an intelligent data generator to create computational databases for end users. We exemplify the recent LASP database construction in zeolite and the metal-ligand properties for a new catalyst design.",

    "abstract": "The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy has witnessed significant progress and promising results in recent years worldwide. From 2019 to 2023, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy has released multiple guidelines/consensus with recommendations on integrating AI for detecting and classifying lesions in practical endoscopy. In Vietnam, since 2019, several preliminary studies have been conducted to develop AI algorithms for GI endoscopy, focusing on lesion detection. These studies have yielded high accuracy results ranging from 86% to 92%. For upper GI endoscopy, ongoing research directions comprise image quality assessment, detection of anatomical landmarks, simulating image-enhanced endoscopy, and semi-automated tools supporting the delineation of GI lesions on endoscopic images. For lower GI endoscopy, most studies focus on developing AI algorithms for colorectal polyps' detection and classification based on the risk of malignancy. In conclusion, the application of AI in this field represents a promising research direction, presenting challenges and opportunities for real-world implementation within the Vietnamese healthcare context.",

    "abstract": "In-vitro fertilization (IVF) has been a transformative advancement in assisted reproductive technology. However, success rates remain suboptimal, with only about one-third of cycles resulting in pregnancy and fewer leading to live births. This narrative review explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) to enhance various stages of the IVF process. Personalization of ovarian stimulation protocols, gamete selection, and embryo annotation and selection are critical areas where AI may benefit significantly. AI-driven tools can analyze vast datasets to predict optimal stimulation protocols, potentially improving oocyte quality and fertilization rates. In sperm and oocyte quality assessment, AI can offer precise, objective analyses, reducing subjectivity and standardizing evaluations. In embryo selection, AI can analyze time-lapse imaging and morphological data to support the prediction of embryo viability, potentially aiding implantation outcomes. However, the role of AI in improving clinical outcomes remains to be confirmed by large-scale, well-designed clinical trials. Additionally, AI has the potential to enhance quality control and workflow optimization within IVF laboratories by continuously monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) and facilitating efficient resource utilization. Ethical considerations, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and fairness, are paramount for the responsible implementation of AI in IVF. Future research should prioritize validating AI tools in diverse clinical settings, ensuring their applicability and reliability. Collaboration among AI experts, clinicians, and embryologists is essential to drive innovation and improve outcomes in assisted reproduction. AI's integration into IVF holds promise for advancing patient care, but its clinical potential requires careful evaluation and ongoing refinement.",

    "abstract": "Failure to predict stroke promptly may lead to delayed treatment, causing severe consequences like permanent neurological damage or death. Early detection using deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models can enhance patient outcomes and mitigate the long-term effects of strokes. The aim of this study is to compare these models, exploring their efficacy in predicting stroke. This study analyzed a dataset comprising 663 records from patients hospitalized at Hazrat Rasool Akram Hospital in Tehran, Iran, including 401 healthy individuals and 262 stroke patients. A total of eight established ML (SVM, XGB, KNN, RF) and DL (DNN, FNN, LSTM, CNN) models were utilized to predict stroke. Techniques such as 10-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were implemented to prevent overfitting. The study also focused on interpretability through Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). The evaluation of model's performance was based on accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1-score, and ROC curve metrics. Among DL models, LSTM showed superior sensitivity at 96.15%, while FNN exhibited better specificity (96.0%), accuracy (96.0%), F1-score (95.0%), and ROC (98.0%) among DL models. For ML models, RF displayed higher sensitivity (99.9%), accuracy (99.0%), specificity (100%), F1-score (99.0%), and ROC (99.9%). Overall, RF outperformed all models, while DL models surpassed ML models in most metrics except for RF. DL models (CNN, LSTM, DNN, FNN) achieved sensitivities from 93.0 to 96.15%, specificities from 80.0 to 96.0%, accuracies from 92.0 to 96.0%, F1-scores from 87.34 to 95.0%, and ROC scores from 95.0 to 98.0%. In contrast, ML models (KNN, XGB, SVM) showed sensitivities between 29.0% and 94.0%, specificities between 89.47% and 96.0%, accuracies between 71.0% and 95.0%, F1-scores between 44.0% and 95.0%, and ROC scores between 64.0% and 95.0%. This study demonstrates the efficacy of DL and ML models in predicting stroke, with the RF models outperforming all others in key metrics. While DL models generally surpassed ML models, RF's exceptional performance highlights the potential of combining these technologies for early stroke detection, significantly improving patient outcomes by preventing severe consequences like permanent neurological damage or death.",

    "abstract": "The randomness and volatility of existing clean energy sources have increased the complexity of grid scheduling. To address this issue, this work proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) empowered method based on the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) big data platform, focusing on multi-objective scheduling optimization for clean energy. This work employs a combination of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) to enhance grid scheduling efficiency and clean energy utilization. First, the work analyzes the complexity and uncertainty challenges faced in clean energy scheduling within the current power system, highlighting the limitations of traditional methods in handling multi-objective optimization and real-time response. Consequently, the work introduces the ESG big data platform and leverages its abundant data resources and computational power to improve the scheduling decision-making process. Next, PSO is used for initial scheduling optimization and a mathematical model for clean energy scheduling optimization is constructed. To further enhance the dynamic response capability of the scheduling process, this work designs a dual-layer architecture. Among this architecture, DQN is responsible for adjusting the PSO initially optimized scheduling plan based on real-time data during the actual scheduling process, adapting it to the instantaneous change demand and renewable energy output characteristics. Finally, to verify the model's effectiveness, this work conducts simulation analyses using real data from the state grid ESG big data platform. The results indicate that this method significantly improves clean energy utilization, increasing it from 62.4% (with traditional methods) to 87.7%, while reducing scheduling costs by 22%. With the increase in communication delay, the generation time of scheduling instruction increases significantly. This is because the algorithm needs to wait longer to receive the complete grid status information, which affects the generation speed of scheduling instructions. Moreover, this method demonstrates good adaptability and stability under different load demands and clean energy supply conditions. This work introduces a novel and efficient method for clean energy scheduling optimization by integrating PSO and DQN. It contributes to the overall improvement of clean energy utilization within the State Grid and provides a theoretical and empirical foundation for further research in related fields.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the optimal operating points of adult-oriented artificial intelligence (AI) software differ for pediatric chest radiographs and to assess its diagnostic performance. Chest radiographs from patients under 19 years old, collected between March and November 2021, were divided into test and exploring sets. A commercial adult-oriented AI software was utilized to detect lung lesions, including pneumothorax, consolidation, nodule, and pleural effusion, using a standard operating point of 15%. A pediatric radiologist reviewed the radiographs to establish ground truth for lesion presence. To determine the optimal operating points, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted, varying thresholds to balance sensitivity and specificity by lesion type, age group, and imaging method. The test set (4,727 chest radiographs, mean 7.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 years) and exploring set (2,630 radiographs, mean 5.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.0 years) yielded optimal operating points of 11% for pneumothorax, 14% for consolidation, 15% for nodules, and 6% for pleural effusion. Using a 3% operating point improved pneumothorax sensitivity for children under 2 years, portable radiographs, and anteroposterior projections. Therefore, optimizing operating points of AI based on lesion type, age, and imaging method could improve diagnostic performance for pediatric chest radiographs, building on adult-oriented AI as a foundation.",

    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), characterized by its ability to generate diverse forms of content including text, images, video and audio, has revolutionized many fields, including medical education. Generative AI leverages machine learning to create diverse content, enabling personalized learning, enhancing resource accessibility, and facilitating interactive case studies. This narrative review explores the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into orthopedic education and training, highlighting its potential, current challenges, and future trajectory. A review of recent literature was conducted to evaluate the current applications, identify potential benefits, and outline limitations of integrating generative AI in orthopedic education. Key findings indicate that generative AI holds substantial promise in enhancing orthopedic training through its various applications such as providing real-time explanations, adaptive learning materials tailored to individual student's specific needs, and immersive virtual simulations. However, despite its potential, the integration of generative AI into orthopedic education faces significant issues such as accuracy, bias, inconsistent outputs, ethical and regulatory concerns and the critical need for human oversight. Although generative AI models such as ChatGPT and others have shown impressive capabilities, their current performance on orthopedic exams remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for further development to match the complexity of clinical reasoning and knowledge application. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges through ongoing research, optimizing generative AI models for medical content, exploring best practices for ethical AI usage, curriculum integration and evaluating the long-term impact of these technologies on learning outcomes. By expanding AI's knowledge base, refining its ability to interpret clinical images, and ensuring reliable, unbiased outputs, generative AI holds the potential to revolutionize orthopedic education. This work aims to provides a framework for incorporating generative AI into orthopedic curricula to create a more effective, engaging, and adaptive learning environment for future orthopedic practitioners.",

    "abstract": "Medical narratives are fundamental to the correct identification of a patient's health condition. This is not only because it describes the patient's situation. It also contains relevant information about the patient's context and health state evolution. Narratives are usually vague and cannot be categorized easily. On the other hand, once the patient's situation is correctly identified based on a narrative, it is then possible to map the patient's situation into precise classification schemas and ontologies that are machine-readable. To this end, language models can be trained to read and extract elements from these narratives. However, the main problem is the lack of data for model identification and model training in languages other than English. First, gold standard annotations are usually not available due to the high level of data protection for patient data. Second, gold standard annotations (if available) are difficult to access. Alternative available data, like MIMIC (Sci Data 3:1, 2016) is written in English and for specific patient conditions like intensive care. Thus, when model training is required for other types of patients, like oncology (and not intensive care), this could lead to bias. To facilitate clinical narrative model training, a method for creating high-quality synthetic narratives is needed.\nWe devised workflows based on generative AI methods to synthesize narratives in the German language to avoid the disclosure of patient's health data. Since we required highly realistic narratives, we generated prompts, written with high-quality medical terminology, asking for clinical narratives containing both a main and co-disease. The frequency of distribution of both the main and co-disease was extracted from the hospital's structured data, such that the synthetic narratives reflect the disease distribution among the patient's cohort. In order to validate the quality of the synthetic narratives, we annotated them to train a Named Entity Recognition (NER) algorithm. According to our assumptions, the validation of this system implies that the synthesized data used for its training are of acceptable quality.\nWe report precision, recall and F1 score for the NER model while also considering metrics that take into account both exact and partial entity matches. Trained models are cautious, with a precision up to 0.8 for Entity Type match metric and a F1 score of 0.3.\nDespite its inherent limitations, this technology has the potential to allow data interoperability by using encoded diseases across languages and regions without compromising data safety. Additionally, it facilitates the synthesis of unstructured patient data. In this way, the identification and training of models can be accelerated. We believe that this method may be able to generate discharge letters for any combination of main and co-diseases, which will significantly reduce the amount of time spent writing these letters by healthcare professionals.",

Additionally, it facilitates the synthesis of unstructured patient data. In this way, the identification and training of models can be accelerated. We believe that this method may be able to generate discharge letters for any combination of main and co-diseases, which will significantly reduce the amount of time spent writing these letters by healthcare professionals.",

Since we required highly realistic narratives, we generated prompts, written with high-quality medical terminology, asking for clinical narratives containing both a main and co-disease. The frequency of distribution of both the main and co-disease was extracted from the hospital's structured data, such that the synthetic narratives reflect the disease distribution among the patient's cohort. In order to validate the quality of the synthetic narratives, we annotated them to train a Named Entity Recognition (NER) algorithm. According to our assumptions, the validation of this system implies that the synthesized data used for its training are of acceptable quality.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) can quantitatively evaluate histopathological findings. The aim was to measure NS in ESCC using AI and elucidate its clinical significance. We investigated the relationship between NS assessed by AI and prognosis in 138 patients with ESCC who underwent curative esophagectomy. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from the deepest tumor sections were digitized. Using HALO-AI DenseNet v2, we created a deep learning classifier that identified tumor cells with an NS area >20 \u03bcm",

    "abstract": "Past work relates intelligence quotient (IQ) to risk for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among soldiers. We gathered data over multiple deployments to assess how IQ relates to the rate of symptom development both directly and through increasing the risk for traumatic combat exposure.\nMale infantry soldiers from a maneuver brigade (N\u202f=\u202f582) were followed over the 3-year period of their mandatory military service. Data were collected at 3-time-points: 1) shortly after enlistment and before deployment; 2) about 15 months into the service following one deployment, and another year later following additional deployments. IQ was measured before recruitment into the military; PTSD symptoms and combat exposure were measured at each time-point.\nLower general IQ, and in particular lower abstract reasoning capabilities, related to steeper increases in PTSD symptoms, TIME\u00d7IQ=\u202f-.05, SE=\u202f.02, t(442.79)\u202f=\u202f-3.255, p\u202f<\u202f.01, controlling for the effect of pre-military traumatic experience. This relation was partly mediated by combat exposure, Effect=\u202f-.04, BootSE=\u202f.01, 95\u202f% CI [-.06, -.02].\nThe results identify important risk factors for PTSD that can inform approaches to PTSD mitigation in the military and other organizations.

    "abstract": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has caught the attention of the world as it challenges the status quo on human operations. As AI has dramatically impacted education, healthcare, industry, and economics, a Catholic ethical study of human dignity in the context of AI in healthcare is presented in this article. The debates regarding whether AI will usher well or doom the dignity of humankind are occasioned by increasing developments of technology in patient care and medical decision-making. This paper draws from Catholic ethics, especially the concepts of inherent human dignity, the sanctity of human life, and morality in the medical field. It talks about using AI to upgrade healthcare outcomes without losing the essential humanity of human dignity in medical practice. It also touches on the most likely ethical issues: the morality of AI-related decisions and the depersonalization of health care. Finally, it provides a framework that brings AI development in tandem with a Catholic vision of human dignity and supports a healthcare system that caters to the common good but correctly respects the irreplaceable value of the human person and highlights moral responsibility.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted design model that combines Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance innovation and efficiency in cultural and creative product design. By introducing AI-driven decision support, the model streamlines the design workflow and significantly improves design quality. The study establishes a comprehensive framework and applies the model to four distinct design tasks, with extensive experiments validating its performance. Key factors, including creativity, cultural adaptability, and practical application, are evaluated through structured surveys and expert feedback. The results reveal that the VAE\u2009+\u2009RL model surpasses alternative approaches across multiple criteria. Highlights include a user satisfaction rate of 95%, a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) score of 0.92, model accuracy of 93%, and a loss reduction to 0.07. These findings confirm the model's superiority in generating high-quality designs and achieving high user satisfaction. Additionally, the model exhibits strong generalization capabilities and operational efficiency, offering valuable insights and data support for future advancements in cultural product design technology.",

    "abstract": "The methodology in colon polyp labeling in establishing database for ma-chine learning is not well-described and standardized. We aimed to find out the best annotation method to generate the most accurate model in polyp detection.\n3542 colonoscopy polyp images were obtained from endoscopy database of a tertiary medical center. Two experienced endoscopists manually annotated the polyp with (1) exact outline segmentation and (2) using a standard rectangle box close to the polyp margin, and extending 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% longer in both width and length of the standard rectangle for AI modeling setup. The images were randomly divided into training and validation sets in 4:1 ratio. U-Net convolutional network architecture was used to develop automatic segmentation machine learning model. Another unrelated verification set was established to evaluate the performance of polyp detection by different segmentation methods.\nExtending the bounding box to 20% of the polyp margin represented the best performance in accuracy (95.42%), sensitivity (94.84%) and F1-score (95.41%). Exact outline segmentation model showed the excellent performance in sensitivity (99.6%) and the worst precision (77.47%). The 20% model was the best among the 6 models. (confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a00.957-0.985; AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.971).\nLabelling methodology affect the predictability of AI model in polyp detection. Extending the bounding box to 20% of the polyp margin would result in the best polyp detection predictive model based on AUC data. It is mandatory to establish a standardized way in colon polyp labeling for comparison of the precision of different AI models.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), a branch of computer science, has been of growing research interest since its introduction to healthcare disciplines in the 1970s. Research has demonstrated that the application of such technologies has allowed for greater task accuracy and efficiency in medical disciplines such as diagnostics, treatment protocols and clinical decision-making. Application in pharmacy practice is reportedly narrower in scope; with greater emphasis placed on stock management and day-to-day function optimisation than enhancing patient outcomes. Despite this, new studies are underway to explore how AI technologies may be utilised in areas such as pharmacist interventions, medication adherence, and personalised medicine. Objective/s: The aim of this study was to identify current use of AI in measuring performance outcomes in pharmacy practice.\nA scoping review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). A comprehensive literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, IPA (International Pharmaceutical Abstracts), and Web of Science databases for articles published between January 1, 2018 to September 11, 2023, relevant to the aim. The final search strategy included the following terms: (\"artificial intelligence\") AND (\"pharmacy\" OR \"pharmacist\" OR \"pharmaceutical service\" OR \"pharmacy service\"). Reference lists of identified review articles were also screened.\nThe literature search identified 560 studies, of which seven met the inclusion criteria. These studies described the use of AI in pharmacy practice. All seven studies utilised models derived from machine learning AI techniques. AI identification of prescriptions requiring pharmacist intervention was the most frequent (n\u00a0=\u00a04), followed by screening services (n\u00a0=\u00a02), and patient-facing mobile applications (n\u00a0=\u00a01). These results indicated a workflow- and productivity-focused application of AI within current pharmacy practice, with minimal intention for direct patient health outcome improvement. Despite this, the review also revealed AI's potential in data collation and analytics to aid in pharmacist contribution towards the healthcare team and improvement of health outcomes.\nThis scoping review has identified, from the literature available, three main areas of focus, (1) identification and classification of atypical or inappropriate medication orders, (2) improving efficiency of mass screening services, and (3) improving adherence and quality use of medicines. It also identified gaps in AI's current utility within the profession and its potential for day-to-day practice, as our understanding of general AI techniques continues to advance.",

    "abstract": "Private-part skin diseases (PPSDs) can cause a patient's stigma, which may hinder the early diagnosis of these diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an effective tool to improve the early diagnosis of PPSDs, especially in preventing the deterioration of skin tumors in private parts such as Paget disease. However, to our knowledge, there is currently no research on using AI to identify PPSDs due to the complex backgrounds of the lesion areas and the challenges in data collection.\nThis study aimed to develop and evaluate an AI-aided diagnosis system for the detection and classification of PPSDs: aiding patients in self-screening and supporting dermatologists' diagnostic enhancement.\nIn this decision analytical modeling study, a 2-stage AI-aided diagnosis system was developed to classify PPSDs. In the first stage, a multitask detection network was trained to automatically detect and classify skin lesions (type, color, and shape). In the second stage, we proposed a knowledge graph based on dermatology expertise and constructed a decision network to classify seven PPSDs (condyloma acuminatum, Paget disease, eczema, pearly penile papules, genital herpes, syphilis, and Bowen disease). A reader study with 13 dermatologists of different experience levels was conducted. Dermatologists were asked to classify the testing cohort under reading room conditions, first without and then with system support. This AI-aided diagnostic study used the data of 635 patients from two institutes between July 2019 and April 2022. The data of Institute 1 contained 2701 skin lesion samples from 520 patients, which were used for the training of the multitask detection network in the first stage. In addition, the data of Institute 2 consisted of 115 clinical images and the corresponding medical records, which were used for the test of the whole 2-stage AI-aided diagnosis system.\nOn the test data of Institute 2, the proposed system achieved the average precision, recall, and F\nIn this study, we constructed the first skin-lesion-based dataset and developed the first AI-aided diagnosis system for PPSDs. This system provides the final diagnosis result by simulating the diagnostic process of dermatologists. Compared with existing advanced algorithms, this system is more accurate in identifying PPSDs. Overall, our system can not only help patients achieve self-screening and alleviate their stigma but also assist dermatologists in diagnosing PPSDs.",

    "abstract": "Covalent modification of proteins at specific, predetermined sites is essential for advancing biological and biopharmaceutical applications. Site-selective labeling techniques for protein modification allow us to effectively track biological function, intracellular dynamics, and localization. Despite numerous reports on modifying target proteins with functional chemical probes, unique organic reactions that achieve site-selective integration without compromising native functional properties remain a significant challenge. In this review, we delve into site-selective protein modification using synthetic probes, highlighting both chemical and computational methodologies for chemo- and regioselective modifications of naturally occurring amino acids, as well as proximity-driven protein-selective chemical modifications. We also underline recent traceless affinity labeling strategies that involve exchange/cleavage reactions and catalyst tethering modifications. The rapid development of computational infrastructure and methods has made the bioconjugation of proteins more accessible, enabling precise predictions of structural changes due to protein modifications. Hence, we discuss bioconjugational computational approaches, including molecular dynamics and artificial intelligence, underscoring their potential applications in enhancing our understanding of cellular biology and addressing current challenges in the field.",

    "abstract": "The current study examined the relationship between creative potential, estimated with tests of divergent thinking (DT), and emotional intelligence (EI). Previous research has hinted at a relationship, but the EI-DT relationship may differ as a function of the tasks and the specific components of EI. With this in mind, the present investigation compared two DT tests (Social Games vs. Titles Games) and examined whether or not the Interpersonal and Intrapersonal subscales of EI were more associated with DT than the Adaptability and Stress Management EI subscales. The youth version of the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i: YV) was used to measure EI. The measure of EI and the two DT tests were administered to 244 male and female gifted (",

    "abstract": "This study aims to assess Croatian dentists' knowledge, attitudes, and use of artificial intelligence (AI) and modern technology, while also identifying perceived barriers to AI and modern technology adoption and evaluating the need for further education and training.\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted in February 2024 among general dentists in Croatia using a self-structured questionnaire. A total of 200 respondents filled out the questionnaire. It included five sections: socio-demographic and professional information, self-assessment of AI and modern technology use, knowledge of AI in dentistry, current innovations and devices used in practice, and barriers to AI and modern technology integration in practice. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and a regression analysis to explore relationships between socio-demographic factors and AI knowledge.\nThe mean knowledge of AI systems was 3.62 \u00b1 2.56 out of a possible score of 7, indicating relatively poor knowledge, with 47.5% demonstrating knowledge below the median. Most respondents (76.0%) did not use AI systems and modern technology in practice; however, prosthodontics (13.0%) and oral surgery (10.0%) were identified as the primary fields utilizing these technologies. Respondents rated their knowledge of modern technologies and AI as weak or moderate, with 60.5% engaged in continuous education. Despite 76.0% not using AI daily, 71.0% believed that these technologies could enhance patient care. Participants interested in further training showed significantly better knowledge of AI applications (\nThe study revealed that most respondents had poor knowledge of AI systems. Despite this, there is a recognition of AI's and modern technology potential in dentistry, emphasizing the need for enhanced education and training in this field.",

    "abstract": "We previously developed artificial intelligence (AI) diagnosis algorithms for predicting the six classes of stomach lesions. However, this required significant computational resources. The incorporation of AI into medical devices has evolved from centralized models to decentralized edge computing devices. In this study, a deep learning endoscopic image classification model was created to automatically categorize all phases of gastric carcinogenesis using an edge computing device.\nA total of 15,910 endoscopic images were collected retrospectively and randomly assigned to train, validation, and internal-test datasets in an 8:1:1 ratio. The major outcomes were as follows: 1. lesion classification accuracy in six categories: normal/atrophy/intestinal metaplasia/dysplasia/early/advanced gastric cancer; and 2. the prospective evaluation of classification accuracy in real-world procedures.\nThe internal-test lesion-classification accuracy was 93.8% (95% confidence interval: 93.4-94.2%); precision was 88.6%, recall was 88.3%, and F1 score was 88.4%. For the prospective performance test, the established model attained an accuracy of 93.3% (91.5-95.1%). The established model's lesion classification inference speed was 2-3 ms on GPU and 5-6 ms on CPU. The expert endoscopists reported no delays in lesion classification or any interference from the deep learning model throughout their exams.\nWe established a deep learning endoscopic image classification model to automatically classify all stages of gastric carcinogenesis using an edge computing device.",

    "abstract": "This qualitative literature review explored the intersection of art, creativity, and the nurse-patient relationship in the context of oncology nursing. It delved into the perceptions and reflections of nurses as captured by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) analysis from two specialized nursing databases.\nThe protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) Platform. A comprehensive search was conducted in CINAHL, the British Nursing Database, and the Nursing & Allied Health Database, using keywords related to art, cancer, creativity, nursing, and relationships. The extracted qualitative research studies were then analyzed using GAI to identify key themes and insights.\nThe analysis revealed profound considerations regarding the role of nurses in oncology and palliative patient care. Nurses acknowledged the spiritual dimension through religious and spiritual practices, while emphasizing authentic presence and empathic communication. They actively addressed patient concerns, adapted to challenges, and engaged in continuous professional development. The insights from the GAI interpretation underscored the significance of empathy, creativity, and artistry in nurturing meaningful nurse-patient connections.\nThe GAI-enabled exploration provided valuable insights into several dimensions of care, emphasizing the importance of spiritual sensitivity, empathic communication, and ongoing professional growth. As technology and human care converge, integrating artistry into the nurse-patient relationship could enhance patient experiences, improve outcomes, and enrich the oncology nursing practice.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety and depression represent prevalent yet frequently undetected mental health concerns within the older population. The challenge of identifying these conditions presents an opportunity for artificial intelligence (AI)-driven, remotely available, tools capable of screening and monitoring mental health. A critical criterion for such tools is their cultural adaptability to ensure effectiveness across diverse populations.\nThis study aims to illustrate the preliminary transferability of two established AI models designed to detect high depression and anxiety symptom scores. The models were initially trained on data from a nonverbal working memory game (1- and 2-back tasks) in a dataset by thymia, a company that develops AI solutions for mental health and well-being assessments, encompassing over 6000 participants from the United Kingdom, United States, Mexico, Spain, and Indonesia. We seek to validate the models' performance by applying it to a new dataset comprising older Brazilian adults, thereby exploring its transferability and generalizability across different demographics and cultures.\nA total of 69 Brazilian participants aged 51-92 years old were recruited with the help of La\u00e7os Sa\u00fade, a company specializing in nurse-led, holistic home care. Participants received a link to the thymia dashboard every Monday and Thursday for 6 months. The dashboard had a set of activities assigned to them that would take 10-15 minutes to complete, which included a 5-minute game with two levels of the n-back tasks. Two Random Forest models trained on thymia data to classify depression and anxiety based on thresholds defined by scores of the Patient Health Questionnaire (8 items) (PHQ-8) \u226510 and those of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (7 items) (GAD-7) \u226510, respectively, were subsequently tested on the La\u00e7os Sa\u00fade patient cohort.\nThe depression classification model exhibited robust performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78, a specificity of 0.69, and a sensitivity of 0.72. The anxiety classification model showed an initial AUC of 0.63, with a specificity of 0.58 and a sensitivity of 0.64. This performance surpassed a benchmark model using only age and gender, which had AUCs of 0.47 for PHQ-8 and 0.53 for GAD-7. After recomputing the AUC scores on a cross-sectional subset of the data (the first n-back game session), we found AUCs of 0.79 for PHQ-8 and 0.76 for GAD-7.\nThis study successfully demonstrates the preliminary transferability of two AI models trained on a nonverbal working memory task, one for depression and the other for anxiety classification, to a novel sample of older Brazilian adults. Future research could seek to replicate these findings in larger samples and other cultural contexts.",

    "abstract": "The construction industry is rapidly adopting Industry 4.0 technologies, creating new opportunities to address persistent environmental and operational challenges. This review focuses on how Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) are being leveraged to tackle these issues. It specifically explores AI's role in predicting air pollution, improving material quality, monitoring worker health and safety, and enhancing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for construction. This study evaluates various AI and ML models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines SVMs, as well as optimization techniques like whale and moth flame optimization. These tools are assessed for their ability to predict air pollutant levels, improve concrete quality, and monitor worker safety in real time. Research papers were also reviewed to understand AI's application in predicting the compressive strength of materials like cement mortar, fly ash, and stabilized clay soil. The performance of these models is measured using metrics such as coefficient of determination (",

    "abstract": "Collaborative intelligence (CI) involves human-machine interactions and is deemed safety-critical because their reliable interactions are crucial in preventing severe injuries and environmental damage. As these applications become increasingly data-driven, the reliability of CI applications depends on the quality of data, shaping the system's ability to interpret and respond in diverse and often unpredictable environments. In this regard, it is important to adhere to data quality standards and guidelines, thus facilitating the advancement of these collaborative systems in industry. This study presents the challenges of data quality in CI applications within industrial environments, with two use cases that focus on the collection of data in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). The first use case involves a framework for quantifying human and robot performance within the context of naturalistic robot learning, wherein humans teach robots using intuitive programming methods within the domain of HRI. The second use case presents real-time user state monitoring for adaptive multi-modal teleoperation, that allows for a dynamic adaptation of the system's interface, interaction modality and automation level based on user needs. The article proposes a hybrid standardization derived from established data quality-related ISO standards and addresses the unique challenges associated with multi-modal HRI data acquisition. The use cases presented in this study were carried out as part of an EU-funded project, Collaborative Intelligence for Safety-Critical Systems (CISC).",

    "abstract": "Community-based learning approaches are gaining recognition in nursing education as a means to address the needs of aging societies by fostering empathy, emotional intelligence, and caring behaviors among nursing students. These attributes are essential for enhancing the quality of care and building strong interpersonal connections with older adults. While community-based education programs offer promising benefits, there is still limited understanding of their impact on nursing students' empathy, emotional intelligence, and caring behaviors. This scoping review aims to examine how community-based educational interventions can assist nursing students in developing these essential competencies, ultimately contributing to better outcomes in geriatric care.\nA scoping review was conducted following the framework of Arksey and O'Malley. The following electronic databases were searched: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE, Web of Science, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Gray literature was also searched through Google Scholar and ProQuest. Studies included reports on nursing students' emotional changes due to educational engagements with older adults.\nA total of 3,001 abstracts were screened, with 78 full texts reviewed, resulting in 9 studies being included in the analysis. The results demonstrate that interactions with older adults enhance nursing students' empathy and emotional intelligence while fostering positive changes in their caring behaviors. Participants reported greater sensitivity to the feelings and physical discomforts of older adults, contributing to improved care and stronger relational dynamics.\nCommunity-based education programs involving older adults represent an effective strategy for enhancing nursing students' empathy, emotional intelligence, and caring behaviors, suggesting valuable implications for nursing education methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Bamboo culm has been widely used in engineering for its high strength, lightweight, and low cost. Its outermost epidermis is a smooth and dense layer that contains cellulose, silica particles, and stomata and acts as a water and mechanical barrier. Recent experimental studies have shown that the layer has a higher mechanical strength than other inside regions. Still, the mechanism is unclear, especially for how the low silica concentration (<10%) can effectively reinforce the layer and prevent the inner fibers from splitting. Here, theoretical analysis is combined with experimental imaging and 3D printing to investigate the effect of the distribution of silica particles on composite mechanics. The anisotropic partial distribution function of silica particles in bamboo skin yields higher toughness (>10%) than randomly distributed particles. A generative artificial intelligence (AI) model inspired by bamboo epidermis is developed to generate particle-reinforced composites. Besides the visual similarity, it is found that the samples by the generative model show failure processes and fracture toughness identical to the actual bamboo epidermis. This work reveals the micromechanics of the bamboo epidermis. It illustrates that generative AI can help design bio-inspired composites of a complex structure that cannot be uniformly represented by a simple building block or optimized around local boundaries. It expands the design space of particle-reinforced composites for enhanced toughness modulus, offering advantages in industries where mechanical reliability is critical.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted medical imaging, particularly in gastrointestinal endoscopy. Computer-aided detection and diagnosis systems (CADe and CADx) are thought to enhance the quality of colonoscopy procedures.\nColonoscopy is essential for colorectal cancer screening, but often misses a significant percentage of adenomas. AI-assisted systems employing deep learning offer improved detection and differentiation of colorectal polyps, potentially increasing adenoma detection rates by 8%-10%. The main benefit of CADe is in detecting small adenomas, whereas it has a limited impact on advanced neoplasm detection. Recent advancements include real-time CADe systems and CADx for histopathological predictions, aiding in the differentiation of neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Biases such as the Hawthorne effect and potential overdiagnosis necessitate large-scale clinical trials to validate the long-term benefits of AI. Additionally, novel concepts such as computer-aided quality improvement systems are emerging to address limitations facing current CADe systems.\nDespite the potential of AI for enhancing colonoscopy outcomes, its effectiveness in reducing colorectal cancer incidence and mortality remains unproven. Further prospective studies are essential to establish the overall utility and clinical benefits of AI in colonoscopy.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), defined as algorithms built to reproduce human behavior, has various applications in health care such as risk prediction, medical image classification, text analysis, and complex disease diagnosis. Due to the increasing availability and volume of data, especially from electronic health records, AI technology is expanding into all fields of nursing and medicine. As the health care system moves toward automation and computationally driven clinical decision-making, nurses play a vital role in bridging the gap between the technological output, the patient, and the health care team. We explore the nurses' role in translating AI-generated output to patients and identify considerations for ensuring informed consent and shared decision-making throughout the process. A brief review of AI technology and informed consent, an identification of power dynamics that underly informed consent, and descriptions of the role of the nurse in various relationships such as nurse-AI, nurse-patient, and patient-AI are covered. Ultimately, nurses and physicians bear the responsibility of upholding and safeguarding the right to informed choice, as it is a fundamental aspect of safe and ethical patient-centered health care.",

    "abstract": "How can we best achieve tissue segmentation and cell counting of multichannel-stained endometriosis sections to understand tissue composition?\nA combination of a machine learning-based tissue analysis software for tissue segmentation and a deep learning-based algorithm for segmentation-independent cell identification shows strong performance on the automated histological analysis of endometriosis sections.\nEndometriosis is characterized by the complex interplay of various cell types and exhibits great variation between patients and endometriosis subtypes.\nEndometriosis tissue samples of eight patients of different subtypes were obtained during surgery.\nEndometriosis tissue was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded before sectioning and staining by (multiplex) immunohistochemistry. A 6-plex immunofluorescence panel in combination with a nuclear stain was established following a standardized protocol. This panel enabled the distinction of different tissue structures and dividing cells. Artificial intelligence-based tissue and cell phenotyping were employed to automatically segment the various tissue structures and extract quantitative features.\nAn endometriosis-specific multiplex panel comprised of PanCK, CD10, \u03b1-SMA, calretinin, CD45, Ki67, and DAPI enabled the distinction of tissue structures in endometriosis. Whereas a machine learning approach enabled a reliable segmentation of tissue substructure, for cell identification, the segmentation-free deep learning-based algorithm was superior.\nThe present analysis was conducted on a limited number of samples for method establishment. For further refinement, quantification of collagen-rich cell-free areas should be included which could further enhance the assessment of the extent of fibrotic changes. Moreover, the method should be applied to a larger number of samples to delineate subtype-specific differences.\nWe demonstrate the great potential of combining multiplex staining and cell phenotyping for endometriosis research. The optimization procedure of the multiplex panel was transferred from a cancer-related project, demonstrating the robustness of the procedure beyond the cancer context. This panel can be employed for larger batch analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the deep learning-based approach is capable of performing cell phenotyping on tissue types that were not part of the training set underlining the potential of the method for heterogenous endometriosis samples.\nAll funding was provided through departmental funds.

    "abstract": "In laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery, proper recognition of loose connective tissue, nerves, vas deferens, and microvessels is important to prevent postoperative complications, such as recurrence, pain, sexual dysfunction, and bleeding. EUREKA (Anaut Inc., Tokyo, Japan) is a system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) for anatomical recognition. This system can intraoperatively confirm the aforementioned anatomical landmarks. In this study, we validated the accuracy of EUREKA in recognizing dissection layers, nerves, vas deferens, and microvessels during transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TAPP).\nWe used TAPP videos to compare EUREKA's recognition of loose connective tissue, nerves, vas deferens, and microvessels with the original surgical video and examined whether EUREKA accurately identified these structures. Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1/Dice scores were calculated to quantitively evaluate AI predictive images.\nThe mean IoU and F1/Dice scores were 0.33 and 0.50 for connective tissue, 0.24 and 0.38 for nerves, 0.50 and 0.66 for the vas deferens, and 0.30 and 0.45 for microvessels, respectively. Compared with the images without EUREKA visualization, dissection layers were very clearly recognized and displayed when appropriate tension was applied.",

    "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) supports clinical and social competencies of a practicing dentist. The Bar-On EI model consists of inter-related competencies in five domains: Self-Perception, Self-Expression, Interpersonal, Decision making, and Stress management. This study investigated the relationship between dental students' EI measured by Emotional Quotient Inventory 2.0 (EQ-i 2.0) and academic and clinical performance at three junctures: Initial, Mid, and Grad.\nThis retrospective cross-sectional study measured correlations between EQ-i 2.0 and performance measures such as Entering GPA and DAT scores, GPAs, preclinical (PreClinMean) and clinical grades (ClinMean), and program learning outcomes (PLOs). Ten cohorts completed three EQ assessments: Initial Attempt 1 (N\u00a0=\u00a0677), Mid Attempt 2 (N\u00a0=\u00a0515), and Grad Attempt 3 (N\u00a0=\u00a0472). Pearson correlations (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) were completed for Attempt 1\u00a0versus Entering GPA, DAT, Year 1 GPA; Attempt 2\u00a0vs. Year 2 GPA, PreclinMean; Attempt 3\u00a0versus Year 4 GPA, ClinMean, PLOs. Multivariate regression analysis was completed for Attempt 1 and Attempt 2\u00a0versus Performance measures. The attempts were compared with t test statistic (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05).\nAttempt 1 showed significant negative correlations between EI and pre-admissions measures. Attempt 1 and Attempt 2 showed significant positive associations for Self-Perception, Empathy, Impulse Control, and Stress Tolerance with academic performance and PLOs. Attempt 3 showed significant positive correlations for Social Responsibility, Empathy, Impulse Control and Decision making with clinical performance. The Interpersonal EQ domain, Empathy, and Happiness significantly declined during matriculation.\nEQ-i 2.0 total score correlated significantly with preclinical and clinical performance in this study and is important for dental student performance.",

After modelling, adjustment, mining and preprocessing (one-hot encoding and SMOTE techniques), 75 input (preliminary data, history, oculomotor test and ocular examinations) and three output (refractive, binocular vision status and eye disease) features were defined. The data were split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets. Five machine learning algorithms were trained, and the best algorithms were subjected to fivefold cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated for accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1 score and specificity.\nThe random forest algorithm was the best for classifying eye examination results with a performance >95.2% (based on 35 input features from preliminary data and history), to propose a subclassification of ocular disorders with a performance >98.1% (based on 65 features from preliminary data, history and ocular examinations) and to differentiate binocular vision dysfunctions with a performance >99.7% (based on 30 features from preliminary data and oculomotor tests). These models were integrated into a responsive web application, available in three languages, allowing intuitive access to the AI models via conventional clinical terms.\nAn AI-based virtual assistant that performed well in predicting patient classification, eye disorders or binocular vision dysfunction has been developed with potential use in primary eye care practice and education programmes.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is administered to pediatric patients with cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. The traditional method uses focal echocardiography to complete the left ventricular measurement. However, echocardiographic determination of the ejection fraction (EF) by manual tracing of the endocardial borders is time consuming and operator dependent. The standard visual assessment is also an inherently subjective procedure. Artificial intelligence (AI) based machine learning-enabled image analysis might provide rapid, reproducible measurements of left ventricular volumes and EF for ECMO patients.\nThis study aims to evaluate the applicability of AI for monitoring cardiac function based on Echocardiography in patients with ECMO.\nWe conducted a retrospective study involving 29 hospitalized patients who received ECMO support between January 2017 and December 2021. Echocardiogram was performed for patients with ECMO, including at pre-ECMO, during cannulation, during ECMO support, during the ECMO wean, and a follow up within 3 months after weaning. EF assessment of all patients was independently evaluated by junior physicians (junior-EF) and experts (expert-EF) using Simpson's biplane method of manual tracing. Additionally, raw data images of apical 2-chamber and 4-chamber views were utilized for EF assessment via a Pediatric ECMO Quantification machine learning-enabled AI (automated-EF).\nThere was no statistically significant difference between the automated-EF and expert-EF for all groups (\nAutomated EF measurements are feasible for pediatric ECMO echocardiography. AI-automated analysis of echocardiography for quantifying left ventricular function in critically ill children has good consistency and reproducibility with that of clinical experts. The automated echocardiographic EF method is reliable for the quantitative evaluation of different heart rates. It can fully support the course of ECMO treatment, and it can help improve the accuracy of quantitative evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Emotional intelligence (EI), which encompasses the ability to perceive, understand, and manage emotions, is crucial for effective human interaction. In healthcare, especially in medicine, compassion and empathy are prioritized qualities associated with enhanced patient outcomes, increased patient compliance, and overall improved healthcare experiences. This study focused on postgraduate medical students to assess their EI levels and identify influencing factors. Methods This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the EI of postgraduate students at a medical college in Pune. Participants, who willingly participated, engaged in face-to-face interviews where they completed a questionnaire addressing sociodemographic information, workload, stress, and Schutte's Emotional Intelligence Test. Data analysis, conducted using MedCalc and Epi Info, presented qualitative variables as frequencies and quantitative data as mean (SD) or median (IQR). Statistical tests were used to identify the associations. Results Involving 139 postgraduates, our study found a mean EI score of 123.48 (12.30). The majority, 97(69.78%), displayed normal scores, 23 (16.55%) scored low, and 19 (13.67%) scored high. Males had higher EI scores. EI increased slightly from the first year to the final year. No significant associations were found with marital status or medical specialty; however, those facing recent emotional trauma exhibited higher levels. Conclusion EI exhibited no significant associations with age, marital status, residential status, year of study, duty hours, stress, or specialty. However, EI demonstrated significant association with male gender and those who faced emotional trauma.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic marked a before and after in the business world, causing a growing demand for applications that streamline operations, reduce delivery times and costs, and improve the quality of products. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) has taken a relevant role in improving these processes, since it incorporates mathematical models that allow analyzing the logical structure of the systems to detect and reduce errors or failures in real-time. This study aimed to determine the most relevant aspects to be considered for detecting software defects using AI. The methodology used was qualitative, with an exploratory, descriptive, and non-experimental approach. The technique involved a documentary review of 79 bibliometric references. The most relevant finding was the use of regression testing techniques and automated log files, in machine learning (ML) and robotic process automation (RPA) environments. These techniques help reduce the time required to identify failures, thereby enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in the lifecycle of applications. In conclusion, companies that incorporate AI algorithms will be able to include an agile model in their lifecycle, as they will reduce the rate of failures, errors, and breakdowns allowing cost savings, and ensuring quality.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common after stroke. Still, routine screening of OSA with polysomnography (PSG) is often unfeasible in clinical practice, primarily because of how limited resources are and the physical condition of patients. In this study, we used several artificial intelligence techniques to predict moderate-to-severe OSA and identify its features in patients with acute ischemic stroke.\nA total of 146 patients with acute ischemic stroke underwent PSG screening for OSA. Their baseline demographic characteristics, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score, and stroke risk factors, were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify significant features associated with moderate-to-severe OSA in patients with stroke. These significant features were used with six machine learning and ensemble learning algorithms, namely decision tree, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and gradient boosting, to compare the performance of several predictive models.\nMultivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age, sex, BMI, neck circumference, and ESS score were significantly associated with the presence of moderate-to-severe OSA. According to the machine learning and ensemble learning results, the XGBoost model achieved the highest performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 and an accuracy and F1 score of 0.80.\nThis study identified key factors contributing to moderate-to-severe OSA in patients with ischemic stroke. The XGBoost model exhibited high predictive performance, indicating it has potential as a supporting tool for decision-making in health-care settings.",

    "abstract": "Perimembranous ventricular septal defect (PMVSD) is a prevalent congenital heart disease, presenting challenges in predicting spontaneous closure, which is crucial for therapeutic decisions. Existing models mainly rely on structured echocardiographic parameters or restricted data. This study introduces an artificial intelligence (AI)-based model, which uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning with the aim of improving spontaneous closure predictability in PMVSD.\nWe did a multicentre, retrospective analysis using data from 29\u2008142 PMVSD patients across six tertiary centres in China from May, 2004, to September, 2022, for training (70%) and validation (30%; dataset 1, 27\u2008269 patients), and from September, 2001, to December, 2009 for testing (dataset 2, 1873 patients). NLP extracted structured data from echocardiography reports and medical records, which were used to develop machine learning models. Models were evaluated for spontaneous closure occurrence and timing by use of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), decision curve analysis, and calibration index.\nSpontaneous closure occurred in 3520 patients (12\u00b71%) at a median of 31 months (IQR 16-56). Eleven NLP-derived predictors, identified via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, highlighted the importance of defect morphology and patient age. The random survival forest algorithm, selected for its superior concordance indexes, showed excellent predictive performance with validation set AUCs (95% CI) of 0\u00b795 (0\u00b794-0\u00b796) for 1-year and 3-year predictions, and 0\u00b795 (0\u00b795-0\u00b796) for 5-year predictions; testing set AUCs were 0\u00b795 (0\u00b794-0\u00b797) for 1-year predictions, 0\u00b797 (0\u00b796-0\u00b798) for 3-year predictions, and 0\u00b798 (0\u00b797-0\u00b799) for 5-year predictions. The model showed high clinical utility through decision curve analysis, calibration, and risk stratification, maintaining consistent accuracy across centres and subgroups.\nThis AI-based model for predicting spontaneous closure in PMVSD patients represents a substantial advancement, potentially improving patient management, reducing risks of delayed or inappropriate treatment, and enhancing clinical outcomes.\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China, Shanghai Municipal Hospital Clinical Technology Project, Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, and Clinical Research Unit of XinHua Hospital.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the anxiety surrounding the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in doctor-patient interactions, analyzing the perspectives of both patients and healthcare providers to identify key concerns and potential solutions.\nThe study employs a comprehensive literature review, examining existing research on AI in healthcare, and synthesizes findings from various surveys and studies that explore the attitudes of patients and doctors towards AI applications in medical settings.\nThe analysis reveals that patient anxiety encompasses algorithm aversion, robophobia, lack of humanistic care, challenges in human-machine interaction, and concerns about AI's universal applicability. Doctors' anxieties stem from fears of replacement, legal liabilities, emotional impacts of work environment changes, and technological apprehension. The paper highlights the need for patient participation, humanistic care, improved interaction methods, educational training, and policy guidelines to foster public understanding and trust in AI.\nThe paper concludes that addressing AI anxiety in doctor-patient relationships is crucial for successfully integrating AI in healthcare. It emphasizes the importance of respecting patient autonomy, addressing the lack of humanistic care, and improving patient-AI interaction to enhance the patient experience and reduce medical errors.\nThe study suggests that future research should focus on understanding the needs and concerns of patients and doctors, strengthening medical humanities education, and establishing policies to guide the ethical use of AI in medicine. It also recommends public education to enhance understanding and trust in AI to improve medical services and ensure professional development and stable work environment for doctors.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing patient comprehension of their health is crucial in improving health outcomes. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in distilling medical information into a conversational, legible format can potentially enhance health literacy. This review aims to examine the accuracy, reliability, comprehensiveness and readability of medical patient education materials (PEMs) simplified by AI models. A systematic review was conducted searching for articles assessing outcomes of use of AI in simplifying PEMs. Inclusion criteria are as follows: publication between January 2019 and June 2023, various modalities of AI, English language, AI use in PEMs and including physicians and/or patients. An inductive thematic approach was utilised to code for unifying topics which were qualitatively analysed. Twenty studies were included, and seven themes were identified (reproducibility, accessibility and ease of use, emotional support and user satisfaction, readability, data security, accuracy and reliability and comprehensiveness). AI effectively simplified PEMs, with reproducibility rates up to 90.7% in specific domains. User satisfaction exceeded 85% in AI-generated materials. AI models showed promising readability improvements, with ChatGPT achieving 100% post-simplification readability scores. AI's performance in accuracy and reliability was mixed, with occasional lack of comprehensiveness and inaccuracies, particularly when addressing complex medical topics. AI models accurately simplified basic tasks but lacked soft skills and personalisation. These limitations can be addressed with higher-calibre models combined with prompt engineering. In conclusion, the literature reveals a scope for AI to enhance patient health literacy through medical PEMs. Further refinement is needed to improve AI's accuracy and reliability, especially when simplifying complex medical information.",

    "abstract": "Medical education, which generally relied heavily on intelligence quotients, has found a new value in emotional intelligence (EI), specifically after the challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had some apparent and some intangible effects, as this required an emergency switch to online teaching and learning.\u00a0 Aim: This study was conducted to compare the trait emotional intelligence (TEI) score of medical undergraduates with the increasing number of years of medical curriculum. The COVID-19 pandemic serendipitously provided an opportunity to compare the TEI scores in pre-pandemic and during pandemic times.\u00a0 Materials and methods: Trait emotional intelligence was computed using a pre-validated Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form (TEIQue-SF). The study was conducted in two time frames and in two study groups, the Class of 2019 (pre-pandemic cohort) and the Class of 2020 (pandemic cohort). Further, the pre-pandemic cohort's EI score was assessed twice, initially in August 2019 (Timeframe 1 (T1) which was before the pandemic) and secondly in October 2020 (Timeframe 2 (T2) which was\u00a0during the pandemic) in Phase II and the COVID-19 first wave was peaking in India. The TEI scores of the pre-pandemic cohort and pandemic cohort were compared using an unpaired T-test. The pre-pandemic cohort scores assessed in two time frames were compared using a paired T-test.\u00a0 Results: The pandemic cohort showed significantly less total TEI (p < 0.05) and well-being score (p < 0.05) in the pre-pandemic cohort from August 2019 (T1) to October 2020 (T2) (p = 0.036).\u00a0 Conclusions: The low TEI scores in the pandemic cohort may be attributed to the sudden psychological and social effects of the pandemic. Moreover, with advancing age and years of medical curriculum, the TEI scores increased.",

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) within worldwide healthcare systems is occurring at a significant rate. In this context, the Middle East has demonstrated distinctive characteristics in the application of AI within the healthcare sector, particularly shaped by regional policies. This study examined the outcomes resulting from the utilization of AI within healthcare systems in the Middle East.\nA systematic review was conducted across several databases, including PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in 2024. The quality assessment of the included studies was conducted using the Authority, Accuracy, Coverage, Objectivity, Date, Significance\u00a0checklist. Following this, a thematic analysis was carried out on the acquired data, adhering to the Boyatzis approach.\n100 papers were included. The quality and bias risk of the included studies were delineated to be within an acceptable range. Multiple themes were derived from the thematic analysis including: \"Prediction of diseases, their diagnosis, and outcomes,\" \"Prediction of organizational issues and attributes,\" \"Prediction of mental health issues and attributes,\" \"Prediction of polypharmacy and emotional analysis of texts,\" \"Prediction of climate change issues and attributes,\" and \"Prediction and identification of success and satisfaction among healthcare individuals.\"\nThe findings emphasized AI's significant potential in addressing prevalent healthcare challenges in the Middle East, such as cancer, diabetes, and climate change. AI has the potential to overhaul the healthcare systems. The findings also highlighted the need for policymakers and administrators to develop a concrete plan to effectively integrate AI into healthcare systems.",

    "abstract": "The magnetic resonance images (MRIs) ability of lesion detection in epilepsy is crucial for a diagnosis and surgical outcome. Using automated artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools for measuring cortical thickness and brain volume originally developed for dementia, we aimed to identify whether it could lateralize epilepsy with normal MRIs.\nNon-lesional 3-Tesla MRIs of 428 patients diagnosed with focal epilepsy, based on semiology and electroencephalography findings, were analyzed. AI-based segmentation/volumetry software measured the cortical thickness and the hippocampal volume. The laterality index (LI) was calculated.\nWe classified into temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE, n=294), frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE, n=86), occipital lobe epilepsy (OLE, n=29), and parietal lobe epilepsy (PLE, n=22). Onset age and MRI age were 24.0\u00b116.6 (0-84) and 35.6\u00b114.8 (16-84) years old. In FLE, the LI of frontal thickness was significantly different between the left and right FLE groups, with LIs of the right FLE group being right-shifted and those of the left FLE group being left-shifted, indicating that the lesion side was thinner than the non-lesion side (\nAI-based brain segmentation software can be helpful to decide the laterality of non-lesional FLE especially with longer duration of disease.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative infections significantly impact patient outcomes and costs, exacerbated by late diagnoses, yet early reliable predictors are scarce. Existing artificial intelligence (AI) models for postoperative infection prediction often lack external validation or perform poorly in local settings when validated. We aimed to develop locally valid models as part of the PERISCOPE AI system to enable early detection, safer discharge, and more timely treatment of patients.\nWe developed and validated XGBoost models to predict postoperative infections within 7 and 30 days of surgery. Using retrospective pre-operative and intra-operative electronic health record data from 2014 to 2023 across various surgical specialities, the models were developed at Hospital A and validated and updated at Hospitals B and C in the Netherlands and Belgium. Model performance was evaluated before and after updating using the two most recent years of data as temporal validation datasets. Main outcome measures were model discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)), calibration (slope, intercept, and plots), and clinical utility (decision curve analysis with net benefit).\nThe study included 253,010 surgical procedures with 23,903 infections within 30-days. Discriminative performance, calibration properties, and clinical utility significantly improved after updating. Final AUROCs after updating for Hospitals A, B, and C were 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-0.83), 0.82 (95% CI 0.81-0.83), and 0.91 (95% CI 0.90-0.91) respectively for 30-day predictions on the temporal validation datasets (2022-2023). Calibration plots demonstrated adequate correspondence between observed outcomes and predicted risk. All local models were deemed clinically useful as the net benefit was higher than default strategies (treat all and treat none) over a wide range of clinically relevant decision thresholds.\nPERISCOPE can accurately predict overall postoperative infections within 7- and 30-days post-surgery. The robust performance implies potential for improving clinical care in diverse clinical target populations. This study supports the need for approaches to local updating of AI models to account for domain shifts in patient populations and data distributions across different clinical settings.\nThis study was funded by a REACT EU grant from European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Kansen voor West.",

    "abstract": "Suicide remains a leading cause of death globally, with nearly 800,000 deaths annually, particularly among young adults in regions like Europe, Australia, and the Middle East, highlighting the urgent need for innovative intervention strategies beyond conventional methods.\nThis review aims to explore the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in enhancing suicide risk prediction and developing effective prevention strategies, examining how these technologies integrate complex risk factors, including psychiatric, socio-economic, dietary, and environmental influences.\nA comprehensive review of literature from databases such as PubMed and Web of Science was conducted, focusing on studies that utilize AI and ML technologies. The review assessed the efficacy of various models, including Random Forest, neural networks, and others, in analyzing data from electronic health records, social media, and digital behaviors. Additionally, it evaluated a broad spectrum of dietary factors and their influence on suicidal behaviors, as well as the impact of environmental contaminants like lithium, arsenic, fluoride, mercury, and organophosphorus pesticides.\nAI and ML are revolutionizing suicide prevention strategies, with models achieving nearly 90\u00a0% predictive accuracy by integrating diverse data sources. Our findings highlight the need for geographically and demographically tailored public health interventions and comprehensive AI models that address the multifactorial nature of suicide risk. However, the deployment of these technologies must address critical ethical and privacy concerns, ensuring compliance with regulations and the development of transparent, ethically guided AI systems. AI-driven tools, such as virtual therapists and chatbots, are essential for immediate support, particularly in underserved regions.",

    "abstract": "We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model to detect immunotherapy -related adverse events (irAEs) from clinical narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) at the patient level.\nTraining data, used for internal validation of the AI model, comprised 1230 clinical notes from 30 patients at The Ohio State University James Cancer Hospital-20 patients who experienced irAEs and ten who did not. 3256 clinical notes of 50 patients were utilized for external validation of the AI model.\nUse of a leave-one-out cross-validation technique for internal validation among those 30 patients yielded accurate identification of 19 of 20 with irAEs (positive patients; 95% sensitivity) and correct dissociation of eight of ten without (negative patients; 80% specificity). External validation on 3256 clinical notes of 50 patients yielded high sensitivity (95%) but moderate specificity (64%). If we improve the model's specificity to 100%, it could eliminate the need to manually review 2500 of those 3256 clinical notes (77%).\nCombined use of this AI model with the manual review of clinical notes will improve both sensitivity and specificity in the detection of irAEs, decreasing workload and costs and facilitating the development of improved immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death caused by acute ocular hypertension is an important characteristic of acute glaucoma. Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) that mediates necroptosis is a potential therapeutic target for RGC death. However, the current understanding of the targeting agents and mechanisms of RIPK3 in the treatment of glaucoma remains limited. Notably, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have significantly advanced drug discovery. This study aimed to discover RIPK3 inhibitor with AI assistance.\nAn acute ocular hypertension model was used to simulate pathological ocular hypertension in vivo. We employed a series of AI methods, including large language and graph neural network models, to identify the target compounds of RIPK3. Subsequently, these target candidates were validated using molecular simulations (molecular docking, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) prediction, and molecular dynamics simulations) and biological experiments (Western blotting and fluorescence staining) in vitro and in vivo.\nAI-driven drug screening techniques have the potential to greatly accelerate drug development. A compound called HG9-91-01, identified using AI methods, exerted neuroprotective effects in acute glaucoma. Our research indicates that all five candidates recommended by AI were able to protect the morphological integrity of RGC cells when exposed to hypoxia and glucose deficiency, and HG9-91-01\u00a0showed a higher cell survival rate compared to the other candidates. Furthermore, HG9-91-01 was found to protect the retinal structure and reduce the loss of retinal layers in an acute glaucoma model. It was also observed that the neuroprotective effects of HG9-91-01 were highly correlated with the inhibition of PANoptosis (apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis). Finally, we found that HG9-91-01 can regulate key proteins related to PANoptosis, indicating that this compound exerts neuroprotective effects in the retina by inhibiting the expression of proteins related to apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis.\nAI-enabled drug discovery revealed that HG9-91-01 could serve as a potential treatment for acute glaucoma.",

A compound called HG9-91-01, identified using AI methods, exerted neuroprotective effects in acute glaucoma. Our research indicates that all five candidates recommended by AI were able to protect the morphological integrity of RGC cells when exposed to hypoxia and glucose deficiency, and HG9-91-01\u00a0showed a higher cell survival rate compared to the other candidates. Furthermore, HG9-91-01 was found to protect the retinal structure and reduce the loss of retinal layers in an acute glaucoma model. It was also observed that the neuroprotective effects of HG9-91-01 were highly correlated with the inhibition of PANoptosis (apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis). Finally, we found that HG9-91-01 can regulate key proteins related to PANoptosis, indicating that this compound exerts neuroprotective effects in the retina by inhibiting the expression of proteins related to apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis.",

    "abstract": "The composite physiologic index (CPI) was developed to estimate the extent of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients based on pulmonary function tests (PFTs). The CALIPER-revised version of the CPI (CALIPER-CPI) was also developed to estimate the volume fraction of ILD measured by CALIPER, an automated quantitative CT postprocessing software. Recently, artificial intelligence-based quantitative CT image analysis software (AIQCT), which can be used to quantify the bronchial volume separately from the ILD volume, was developed and validated in IPF. The aim of this study was to develop AIQCT-derived CPI formulas to quantify CT abnormalities in IPF and to investigate the associations of these CPI formulas with survival.\nThe first cohort included 116 patients with IPF. In this cohort, ILD, bronchial, and hyperlucent volumes on CT were quantified using AIQCT. New CPI formulas were developed based on PFTs to estimate the volume fraction of ILD (ILD-CPI), the sum of the ILD and bronchial volume fractions (ILDB-CPI), and the sum of the ILD, bronchial and hyperlucent volume fractions (ILDBH-CPI). The associations of the original CPI, the CALIPER-CPI and the AIQCT-derived CPIs with survival were analyzed in the first cohort and in a second cohort of patients with IPF (n\u2009=\u200972).\nIn the first cohort, over a median observation time of 92.8 months, 79 patients (68.1%) died, and one patient (0.9%) underwent living-donor lung transplantation. The original CPI, the CALIPER-CPI, and all AIQCT-derived CPIs were associated with overall survival (hazard ratios: 1.07-1.22). The C-index of the ILDB-CPI (0.759) was the highest among all AIQCT-derived CPIs and was comparable to that of the original CPI (0.765) and the CALIPER-CPI (0.749). The C-index of the ILDBH-CPI (0.729) was lower than that of the other CPI variables. The second cohort yielded similar C-indices as the first cohort for the original CPI (0.738), CALIPER-CPI (0.757) and ILDB-CPI (0.749).\nThe ILDB-CPI can predict the outcomes of IPF patients with a similar performance to that of the original CPI and the CALIPER-CPI. Adding the hyperlucent volume to the CPI formula did not improve its predictive accuracy for mortality.\nNone (no health care interventions were performed).",

    "abstract": "Interactive artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT have gained popularity, yet little is known about their reliability as a reference tool for healthcare-related information for healthcare providers and trainees. The objective of this study was to assess the consistency, quality, and accuracy of the responses generated by ChatGPT on healthcare-related inquiries.\nA total of 18 open-ended questions including six questions in three defined clinical areas (2 each to address \"what\", \"why\", and \"how\", respectively) were submitted to ChatGPT v3.5 based on real-world usage experience. The experiment was conducted in duplicate using 2 computers. Five investigators independently ranked each response using a 4-point scale to rate the quality of the bot's responses. The Delphi method was used to compare each investigator's score with the goal of reaching at least 80% consistency. The accuracy of the responses was checked using established professional references and resources. When the responses were in question, the bot was asked to provide reference material used for the investigators to determine the accuracy and quality. The investigators determined the consistency, accuracy, and quality by establishing a consensus.\nThe speech pattern and length of the responses were consistent within the same user but different between users. Occasionally, ChatGPT provided 2 completely different responses to the same question. Overall, ChatGPT provided more accurate responses (8 out of 12) to the \"what\" questions with less reliable performance to the \"why\" and \"how\" questions. We identified errors in calculation, unit of measurement, and misuse of protocols by ChatGPT. Some of these errors could result in clinical decisions leading to harm. We also identified citations and references shown by ChatGPT that did not exist in the literature.\nChatGPT is not ready to take on the coaching role for either healthcare learners or healthcare professionals. The lack of consistency in the responses to the same question is problematic for both learners and decision-makers. The intrinsic assumptions made by the chatbot could lead to erroneous clinical decisions. The unreliability in providing valid references is a serious flaw in using ChatGPT to drive clinical decision making.",

Overall, ChatGPT provided more accurate responses (8 out of 12) to the \"what\" questions with less reliable performance to the \"why\" and \"how\" questions. We identified errors in calculation, unit of measurement, and misuse of protocols by ChatGPT. Some of these errors could result in clinical decisions leading to harm. We also identified citations and references shown by ChatGPT that did not exist in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrates high potential when applied to radiomic analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to discriminate sinonasal tumors. This can enhance diagnostic suspicion beyond visual assessment alone and prior to biopsy, leading to expedite the diagnostic timeline and the treatment planning. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the current advancements and accuracy of this technology in this domain.\nA systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria comprised studies utilizing any machine learning approach applied to MRI of patients with sinonasal tumors. For each study, comprehensive data were gathered on the MRI protocols, feature extraction techniques, and classifiers employed to develop the AI model. The performance was assessed based on accuracy and area under the curve (AUC).\nFourteen studies, published between May 2017 and August 2024, were included. These studies were categorized into three groups: those examining both benign and malignant tumors, those investigating malignant tumor subpopulations, and those focusing on benign pathologies. All studies reported an AUC greater than 0.800, achieving AUC\u2009>\u20090.89 and accuracy\u2009>\u20090.81 when incorporating clinical-radiological variables. Notably, the best discrimination performance was observed in studies utilizing combined conventional MRI sequences, including T1-weighted, contrasted T1-weighted, and T2-weighted images.\nThe application of AI and radiomics in analyzing MRI scans presents significant promise for improving the discrimination of sinonasal tumors. Integrating clinical and radiological indicators enhances model performance, suggesting that future research should focus on larger patient cohorts and diverse AI methodologies to refine diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the nutritional status, height development and intellectual development level of rural children aged 10-12 years in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, and to analyze the relationship between the nutritional status and height development of local schoolchildren and their intellectual development.\nIn 2019, a total of 1721 students were selected from 8 counties(cities) under the jurisdiction of Linxia Prefecture in Gansu Province, with 1 township selected from each county in 5 directions: east, west, south, north, and central. One primary school was randomly selected from each township, and 45 students aged 10-12 were selected from each primary school. Measure children&apos;s height and weight data, calculate body mass index(BMI). Using the Chinese Joint Raven Test(Rural Edition) for intelligence testing and using the norm to calculate their intelligence quotient(IQ). Based on national standards for children&apos;s nutrition, height development, and intelligence, explore the relationship between children&apos;s nutritional status, height development, and intelligence.\nThe IQ of children with moderate to severe weight loss, mild weight loss, normal, overweight, and obesity were 102.7, 102.8, 103.3, 102.5 and 106.9, respectively. The better the nutritional status of children, the higher their IQ values, and the intelligence of children was statistically significant(H=602.816, P&lt;0.001). The detection rate of intellectual disability in overweight children was 0%, while the detection rate of low, marginal, and extremely excellent intelligence in obese children was 0%. The IQ of children in the growth retardation group and non growth retardation group were 99.5 and 103.3, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant(U=171.000, P&lt;0.05). The intelligence of children with different height development levels is statistically significant(H=55.174, P&lt;0.001), and the average intelligence of children increases with the increase of height levels. The detection rate of low and marginal intelligence among children with upper height was 0%, the detection rate of extremely high intelligence was also 0%, and the detection rate of average and above intelligence was 90.9%. Ordered logistic regression analysis showed that the height level was above average(OR=0.598, 95%CI 0.397-0.899, P&lt;0.05), above average(OR=0.002, 95%CI 0.027 2-0.747, P&lt;0.05), nutritional status was normal(OR=0.633, 95%CI 0.484-0.980, P&lt;0.05), overweight(OR=0.487, 95%CI 0.299-0.795, P&lt;0.05), obesity(OR=0.569, 95%CI 0.358-0.907, P&lt;0.05), and non growth and developmental delay(OR=0.578, 95%CI 0.371-0.901, P&lt;0.05) were all local. Protective factors for the intelligence of children.\nThe nutritional status and height development of rural children in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province are related to intelligence.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, has added complexity and richness to the virtual environment by increasing the presence of AI-generated content (AIGC). Although social media platforms such as TikTok have begun labeling AIGC to facilitate the ability for users to distinguish it from human-generated content, little research has been performed to examine the effect of these AIGC labels.\nThis study investigated the impact of AIGC labels on perceived accuracy, message credibility, and sharing intention for misinformation through a web-based experimental design, aiming to refine the strategic application of AIGC labels.\nThe study conducted a 2\u00d72\u00d72 mixed experimental design, using the AIGC labels (presence vs absence) as the between-subjects factor and information type (accurate vs inaccurate) and content category (for-profit vs not-for-profit) as within-subjects factors. Participants, recruited via the Credamo platform, were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (with labels) or a control group (without labels). Each participant evaluated 4 sets of content, providing feedback on perceived accuracy, message credibility, and sharing intention for misinformation. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 29 and included repeated-measures ANOVA and simple effects analysis, with significance set at P<.05.\nAs of April 2024, this study recruited a total of 957 participants, and after screening, 400 participants each were allocated to the experimental and control groups. The main effects of AIGC labels were not significant for perceived accuracy, message credibility, or sharing intention. However, the main effects of information type were significant for all 3 dependent variables (P<.001), as were the effects of content category (P<.001). There were significant differences in interaction effects among the 3 variables. For perceived accuracy, the interaction between information type and content category was significant (P=.005). For message credibility, the interaction between information type and content category was significant (P<.001). Regarding sharing intention, both the interaction between information type and content category (P<.001) and the interaction between information type and AIGC labels (P=.008) were significant.\nThis study found that AIGC labels minimally affect perceived accuracy, message credibility, or sharing intention but help distinguish AIGC from human-generated content. The labels do not negatively impact users' perceptions of platform content, indicating their potential for fact-checking and governance. However, AIGC labeling applications should vary by information type; they can slightly enhance sharing intention and perceived accuracy for misinformation. This highlights the need for more nuanced strategies for AIGC labels, necessitating further research.",

    "abstract": "The EZ DEVICE is an integrated fluorescence microflow cytometer designed for automated cell phenotyping and enumeration using artificial intelligence (AI). The platform consists of a laser diode, optical filter, objective lens, CMOS image sensor, and microfluidic chip, enabling automated sample pretreatment, labeling, and detection within a single compact unit. AI algorithms segment and identify objects in images captured by the CMOS sensor at 532 and 586\u00a0nm emission wavelengths. The device's counting performance, tested with rainbow and FITC-labeled beads, closely matched results from manual counting using an Olympus IX73 microscope. Antibody-staining efficiency was evaluated with antibody-particle beads and IgG k isotype-FITC, achieving a 99.06% staining efficiency. Practical feasibility was demonstrated through the phenotyping of immune cell lines (Jurkat T and THP-1) using specific fluorescent antibodies. The system successfully detected MHC I expression and distinguished CD3 expression patterns in Jurkat T-cells, demonstrating its capability to recognize distinct cell statuses. With its compact design, automated features, and efficient staining and detection, the EZ DEVICE shows promise for diverse applications, including clinical diagnostics, point-of-care testing, and research, enabling real-time immune monitoring and precise cell analysis. Future enhancements, such as optimized microfluidics, advanced imaging, and AI-driven algorithms, aim to improve single-cell throughput and expand its utility in personalized medicine and public health.",

    "abstract": "In 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT 3.5, which is now widely used in medical education, training, and research. Despite its valuable use for the generation of information, concerns persist about its authenticity and accuracy. Its undisclosed information source and outdated dataset pose risks of misinformation. Although it is widely used, AI-generated text inaccuracies raise doubts about its reliability. The ethical use of such technologies is crucial to uphold scientific accuracy in research.\nThis study aimed to assess the accuracy of ChatGPT in doing GESEA tests 1 and 2.\nThe 100 multiple-choice theoretical questions from GESEA certifications 1 and 2 were presented to ChatGPT, requesting the selection of the correct answer along with an explanation. Expert gynaecologists evaluated and graded the explanations for accuracy.\nChatGPT showed a 59% accuracy in responses, with 64% providing comprehensive explanations. It performed better in GESEA Level 1 (64% accuracy) than in GESEA Level 2 (54% accuracy) questions.\nChatGPT is a versatile tool in medicine and research, offering knowledge, information, and promoting evidence-based practice. Despite its widespread use, its accuracy has not been validated yet. This study found a 59% correct response rate, highlighting the need for accuracy validation and ethical use considerations. Future research should investigate ChatGPT's truthfulness in subspecialty fields such as gynaecologic oncology and compare different versions of chatbot for continuous improvement.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has a great potential in scientific research. However, the validity of outputs remains unverified. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of responses generated by ChatGPT to enhance the critical use of this tool.",

    "abstract": "The rise of Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping healthcare, particularly in medical imaging. In this emerging field, clinical imaging personnel need proper training. However, formal AI education is lacking in medical curricula, coupled with a shortage of studies synthesising the availability of AI curricula tailored for clinical imaging personnel. This study therefore addresses the question \"what are the current AI training programs or curricula for clinical imaging personnel?\"\nThis review follows Arksey & O'Malley's framework and the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. Six electronic databases were searched between June and September 2023 and the screening process comprised two stages. Data extraction was performed using a standardised charting form. Data was summarised in table format and thematically.\nTwenty-two studies were included in this review. The goals of the curriculum include enhancing AI knowledge through the delivery of educational content and encouraging practical application and skills development in AI. The learning objectives comprise technical proficiency and model development, foundational knowledge and understanding, literature review and information utilisation, and practical application and problem-solving skills. Course content spanned nine areas, from fundamentals of AI to imaging informatics. Most curricula adopted an online mode of delivery, and the program duration varied significantly. All programs utilised didactic presentations, with several incorporating additional teaching methods and activities to fulfil curriculum goals. The target audiences and participants primarily involved radiology residents, while the creators and instructors comprised a multidisciplinary team of radiology and AI personnel. Various tools and resources were utilised, encompassing online courses and cloud-based notebooks. The curricula were well-received by participants, and time constraint emerged as a major challenge.\nThis scoping review provides an overview of the AI educational programs from existing literature to guide future developments in AI educational curricula. Future education efforts should prioritise evidence-based curriculum design, expand training offerings to radiographers, increase content offerings in imaging informatics, and effectively utilise different teaching strategies and training tools and resources in the curriculum.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of 3 artificial intelligence language models-GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and Gemini, in delivering patient-centered information about thyroid eye disease (TED). We evaluated their performance based on the accuracy and comprehensiveness of their responses to common patient inquiries regarding TED. The study did not assess the repeatability of artificial intelligence responses, focusing on single-session evaluations per model.\nFive experienced oculoplastic surgeons assessed the responses generated by the artificial intelligence models to 12 key questions frequently asked by TED patients. These questions addressed TED pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and treatment options. Each response was rated for correctness and reliability on a 7-point Likert scale, where 1 indicated incorrect or unreliable information and 7 indicated highly accurate and reliable information. Correctness referred to factual accuracy, while reliability assessed trustworthiness for patient use. The evaluations were anonymized, and the final scores were averaged across the surgeons to facilitate model comparisons.\nGPT-3.5 emerged as the top performer, achieving an average correctness score of 5.75 and a reliability score of 5.68, excelling in delivering detailed information on complex topics such as TED treatment and surgical interventions. GPT-4o followed with scores of 5.32 for correctness and 5.25 for reliability, generally providing accurate but less detailed information. Gemini trailed with scores of 5.10 for correctness and 4.70 for reliability, often providing sufficient responses for simpler questions but lacking detail in complex areas like second-line immunosuppressive treatments. Statistical analysis using the Friedman test showed significant differences between models (p < 0.05) for key topics, with GPT-3.5 consistently leading.\nGPT-3.5 was the most effective model for delivering reliable and comprehensive patient information, particularly for complex treatment and surgical topics. GPT-4o provided reliable general information but lacked the necessary depth for specialized topics, while Gemini was suitable for addressing basic patient inquiries but insufficient for detailed medical information. This study highlights the role of artificial intelligence in patient education, suggesting that models like GPT-3.5 can be valuable tools for clinicians in enhancing patient understanding of TED.",

Gemini trailed with scores of 5.10 for correctness and 4.70 for reliability, often providing sufficient responses for simpler questions but lacking detail in complex areas like second-line immunosuppressive treatments. Statistical analysis using the Friedman test showed significant differences between models (p < 0.05) for key topics, with GPT-3.5 consistently leading.",
