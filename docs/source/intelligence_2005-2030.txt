    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) predictive models in primary health care have the potential to enhance population health by rapidly and accurately identifying individuals who should receive care and health services. However, these models also carry the risk of perpetuating or amplifying existing biases toward diverse groups. We identified a gap in the current understanding of strategies used to assess and mitigate bias in primary health care algorithms related to individuals' personal or protected attributes.\nThis study aimed to describe the attempts, strategies, and methods used to mitigate bias in AI models within primary health care, to identify the diverse groups or protected attributes considered, and to evaluate the results of these approaches on both bias reduction and AI model performance.\nWe conducted a scoping review following Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines, searching Medline (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (Ovid), and Web of Science databases for studies published between January 1, 2017, and November 15, 2022. Pairs of reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, applied selection criteria, and performed full-text screening. Discrepancies regarding study inclusion were resolved by consensus. Following reporting standards for AI in health care, we extracted data on study objectives, model features, targeted diverse groups, mitigation strategies used, and results. Using the mixed methods appraisal tool, we appraised the quality of the studies.\nAfter removing 585 duplicates, we screened 1018 titles and abstracts. From the remaining 189 full-text articles, we included 17 studies. The most frequently investigated protected attributes were race (or ethnicity), examined in 12 of the 17 studies, and sex (often identified as gender), typically classified as \"male versus female\" in 10 of the studies. We categorized bias mitigation approaches into four clusters: (1) modifying existing AI models or datasets, (2) sourcing data from electronic health records, (3) developing tools with a \"human-in-the-loop\" approach, and (4) identifying ethical principles for informed decision-making. Algorithmic preprocessing methods, such as relabeling and reweighing data, along with natural language processing techniques that extract data from unstructured notes, showed the greatest potential for bias mitigation. Other methods aimed at enhancing model fairness included group recalibration and the application of the equalized odds metric. However, these approaches sometimes exacerbated prediction errors across groups or led to overall model miscalibrations.\nThe results suggest that biases toward diverse groups are more easily mitigated when data are open-sourced, multiple stakeholders are engaged, and during the algorithm's preprocessing stage. Further empirical studies that include a broader range of groups, such as Indigenous peoples in Canada, are needed to validate and expand upon these findings.\nOSF Registry osf.io/9ngz5/; https://osf.io/9ngz5/.\nRR2-10.2196/46684.",

    "abstract": "To construct a non-invasive pre-hospital screening model and early based on artificial intelligence algorithms to provide the severity of stroke in patients, provide screening, guidance and early warning for stroke patients and their families, and provide data support for clinical decision-making.\nA retrospective study was conducted. The clinical information of stroke patients (n = 53 793) were extracted from the Yidu cloud big data server system of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University from January 1, 2001 to July 31, 2023. Combined with the results of single factor screening and the opinions of experts with senior professional titles in neurology, the input variable was determined, and the output variable was the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) representing the severity of the disease at admission. Python 3.7 was used to build DeepFM algorithm model, and five data mining models including Logistic regression, CART decision tree, C5.0 decision tree, Bayesian network and deep neural network (DNN) were built at the same time. The original data were randomly divided into 80% training set and 20% test set, which were used to train and test the models, adjust the parameters of each model, respectively calculate the accuracy, sensitivity and F-index of the six models, carry out the comprehensive comparison and evaluation of the model. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) and calibration curve were drawn, compared the prediction performance of DeepFM model and the other five algorithms. In addition, the data of stroke patients (n = 1 028) were extracted from Dalian Central Hospital for external verification of the model.\nA total of 14 015 stroke patients with complete information were selected, including 11 212 in the training set and 2 803 in the testing set. After univariate screening, 14 indicators were included to construct the model, including gender, age, recurrence, physical impairment, facial problems, speech disorders, head reactions, disturbance of consciousness, visual disorders, abnormal cough and swallowing, high risk factor, family history, smoking history and drinking history. DeepFM model adopted the two-order crossover feature. The number of hidden layers in DNN layer was 3. Dropout was used to discard the neurons in the neural network. Rule was used as the activation function. Each layer used Dense full connection. The objective function was random gradient descent. The number of iterations was 15. There were 133 922 training parameters in total. Comparing the predictive value of the six models showed that the accuracy of DeepFM model was 0.951, the sensitivity was 0.992, the specificity was 0.814, the F-index was 0.950, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.916. The accuracy of the other five data mining models was between 0.771-0.780, the sensitivity was between 0.978-0.987, the F-index was between 0.690-0.707, and the AUC was between 0.568-0.639. The calibration curve of the DeepFM model was more aligned with the ideal curve than the other five data mining models. Suggesting that the prediction performance of DeepFM model was the best. External validation was conducted on the DeepFM model, and its accuracy was 0.891, indicating good generalization performance of the model.\nThe pre-hospital non-invasive screening prediction model based on DeepFM can accurately predict the severity grading of stroke patients, and has potential application value in rapid screening and early clinical decision-making of stroke.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, research has progressed steadily in regard to the use of computers to recognize and render sign language. This paper reviews significant projects in the field beginning with finger-spelling hands such as \"Ralph\" (robotics), CyberGloves (virtual reality sensors to capture isolated and continuous signs), camera-based projects such as the CopyCat interactive American Sign Language game (computer vision), and sign recognition software (Hidden Markov Modeling and neural network systems). Avatars such as \"Tessa\" (Text and Sign Support Assistant; three-dimensional imaging) and spoken language to sign language translation systems such as Poland's project entitled \"THETOS\" (Text into Sign Language Automatic Translator, which operates in Polish; natural language processing) are addressed. The application of this research to education is also explored. The \"ICICLE\" (Interactive Computer Identification and Correction of Language Errors) project, for example, uses intelligent computer-aided instruction to build a tutorial system for deaf or hard-of-hearing children that analyzes their English writing and makes tailored lessons and recommendations. Finally, the article considers synthesized sign, which is being added to educational material and has the potential to be developed by students themselves.",

    "abstract": "In 2001, Julian Savulescu wrote an article entitled 'Procreative Beneficence: Why We Should Select the Best Children', in which he argued for the genetic selection of intelligence in children. That article contributes to a debate on whether genetic research on intelligence should be undertaken at all and, if so, should intelligence selection be available to potential parents. As such, the question of intelligence selection relates to wider issues concerning the genetic determinism of behavioural traits, i.e. alcoholism. This article is designed as an engagement in the intelligence selection debate using an analysis of Savulescu's arguments to raise a series of problematic issues in relation to the ethics of parental selection of intelligence. These problematic issues relate to wider assumptions that are made in order to put forward intelligence selection as a viable ethical option. Such assumptions are more generic in character, but still relate to Savulescu's article, concerning issues of genetic determinism, private allocation and inequality, and, finally, individual versus aggregate justice. The conclusion focuses on what the implications are for the question of agency, especially if intelligence selection is allowed.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, research has progressed steadily in regard to the use of computers to recognize and render sign language. This paper reviews significant projects in the field beginning with finger-spelling hands such as \"Ralph\" (robotics), CyberGloves (virtual reality sensors to capture isolated and continuous signs), camera-based projects such as the CopyCat interactive American Sign Language game (computer vision), and sign recognition software (Hidden Markov Modeling and neural network systems). Avatars such as \"Tessa\" (Text and Sign Support Assistant; three-dimensional imaging) and spoken language to sign language translation systems such as Poland's project entitled \"THETOS\" (Text into Sign Language Automatic Translator, which operates in Polish; natural language processing) are addressed. The application of this research to education is also explored. The \"ICICLE\" (Interactive Computer Identification and Correction of Language Errors) project, for example, uses intelligent computer-aided instruction to build a tutorial system for deaf or hard-of-hearing children that analyzes their English writing and makes tailored lessons and recommendations. Finally, the article considers synthesized sign, which is being added to educational material and has the potential to be developed by students themselves.",

Part I was dedicated to the analysis of organic impurities formed during synthesis in order to investigate traffic tendencies and highlight potential links between samples, whereas this part focuses on physical characteristics of the MDMA tablets. Diameter, thickness, weight and score were demonstrated to be reliable and relevant features in this drug intelligence perspective. Distributions of samples coming from the same post-tabletting batch (post-TB) and samples coming from different post-TB were very well discriminated by using the squared Euclidean or the Manhattan distance on standardised data. Our findings demonstrated the possibility to discriminate between MDMA samples issued from different post-TB and to find out links between samples coming from a same post-TB. Furthermore, the hypothesis that most of the MDMA samples found on the international market come from the same countries was supported.",

Part I was dedicated to the analysis of organic impurities formed during synthesis in order to investigate traffic tendencies and highlight potential links between samples, whereas this part focuses on physical characteristics of the MDMA tablets. Diameter, thickness, weight and score were demonstrated to be reliable and relevant features in this drug intelligence perspective. Distributions of samples coming from the same post-tabletting batch (post-TB) and samples coming from different post-TB were very well discriminated by using the squared Euclidean or the Manhattan distance on standardised data. Our findings demonstrated the possibility to discriminate between MDMA samples issued from different post-TB and to find out links between samples coming from a same post-TB. Furthermore, the hypothesis that most of the MDMA samples found on the international market come from the same countries was supported.",

    "abstract": "This study examined Italian and U.S. children's performance on the English and Italian versions, respectively, of the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS; Naglieri & Conway, 2009; Naglieri & Das, 1997), a test based on a neurocognitive theory of intelligence entitled PASS (Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, and Successive; Naglieri & Das, 1997; Naglieri & Otero, 2011). CAS subtest, PASS scales, and Full Scale scores for Italian (N=809) and U.S. (N=1,174) samples, matched by age and gender, were examined. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis results supported the configural invariance of the CAS factor structure between Italians and Americans for the 5- to 7-year-old (root-mean-square error of approximation [RMSEA]=.038; 90% confidence interval [CI]=.033, .043; comparative fit index [CFI]=.96) and 8- to 18-year-old (RMSEA=.036; 90% CI=.028, .043; CFI=.97) age groups. The Full Scale standard scores (using the U.S. norms) for the Italian (100.9) and U.S. (100.5) samples were nearly identical. The scores between the samples for the PASS scales were very similar, except for the Attention Scale (d=0.26), where the Italian sample's mean score was slightly higher. Negligible mean differences were found for 9 of the 13 subtest scores, 3 showed small d-ratios (2 in favor of the Italian sample), and 1 was large (in favor of the U.S. sample), but some differences in subtest variances were found. These findings suggest that the PASS theory, as measured by CAS, yields similar mean scores and showed factorial invariance for these samples of Italian and American children, who differ on cultural and linguistic characteristics.",

The correlations between these assessments were examined using a series of Pearson correlations coefficients, with Bonferroni correction.\nGeneral criminal thinking, reactive criminal thinking and five criminal thinking styles (mollification, cutoff, power orientation, cognitive indolence and discontinuity) negatively correlated with emotional intelligence. On the other hand, proactive criminal thinking and three criminal thinking styles (entitlement, superoptimism and sentimentality) did not associate with emotional intelligence.\nEmotional intelligence is an important correlate of individual differences in criminal thinking, especially its reactive aspects. Practical implications of this suggestion were discussed.",

    "abstract": "This study examined Italian and U.S. children's performance on the English and Italian versions, respectively, of the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS; Naglieri & Conway, 2009; Naglieri & Das, 1997), a test based on a neurocognitive theory of intelligence entitled PASS (Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, and Successive; Naglieri & Das, 1997; Naglieri & Otero, 2011). CAS subtest, PASS scales, and Full Scale scores for Italian (N=809) and U.S. (N=1,174) samples, matched by age and gender, were examined. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis results supported the configural invariance of the CAS factor structure between Italians and Americans for the 5- to 7-year-old (root-mean-square error of approximation [RMSEA]=.038; 90% confidence interval [CI]=.033, .043; comparative fit index [CFI]=.96) and 8- to 18-year-old (RMSEA=.036; 90% CI=.028, .043; CFI=.97) age groups. The Full Scale standard scores (using the U.S. norms) for the Italian (100.9) and U.S. (100.5) samples were nearly identical. The scores between the samples for the PASS scales were very similar, except for the Attention Scale (d=0.26), where the Italian sample's mean score was slightly higher. Negligible mean differences were found for 9 of the 13 subtest scores, 3 showed small d-ratios (2 in favor of the Italian sample), and 1 was large (in favor of the U.S. sample), but some differences in subtest variances were found. These findings suggest that the PASS theory, as measured by CAS, yields similar mean scores and showed factorial invariance for these samples of Italian and American children, who differ on cultural and linguistic characteristics.",

    "abstract": "CONSPECTUS: What we can call a molecular robot is a set of molecular devices such as sensors, logic gates, and actuators integrated into a consistent system. The molecular robot is supposed to react autonomously to its environment by receiving molecular signals and making decisions by molecular computation. Building such a system has long been a dream of scientists; however, despite extensive efforts, systems having all three functions (sensing, computation, and actuation) have not been realized yet. This Account introduces an ongoing research project that focuses on the development of molecular robotics funded by MEXT (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan). This 5 year project started in July 2012 and is titled \"Development of Molecular Robots Equipped with Sensors and Intelligence\". The major issues in the field of molecular robotics all correspond to a feedback (i.e., plan-do-see) cycle of a robotic system. More specifically, these issues are (1) developing molecular sensors capable of handling a wide array of signals, (2) developing amplification methods of signals to drive molecular computing devices, (3) accelerating molecular computing, (4) developing actuators that are controllable by molecular computers, and (5) providing bodies of molecular robots encapsulating the above molecular devices, which implement the conformational changes and locomotion of the robots. In this Account, the latest contributions to the project are reported. There are four research teams in the project that specialize on sensing, intelligence, amoeba-like actuation, and slime-like actuation, respectively. The molecular sensor team is focusing on the development of molecular sensors that can handle a variety of signals. This team is also investigating methods to amplify signals from the molecular sensors. The molecular intelligence team is developing molecular computers and is currently focusing on a new photochemical technology for accelerating DNA-based computations. They also introduce novel computational models behind various kinds of molecular computers necessary for designing such computers. The amoeba robot team aims at constructing amoeba-like robots. The team is trying to incorporate motor proteins, including kinesin and microtubules (MTs), for use as actuators implemented in a liposomal compartment as a robot body. They are also developing a methodology to link DNA-based computation and molecular motor control. The slime robot team focuses on the development of slime-like robots. The team is evaluating various gels, including DNA gel and BZ gel, for use as actuators, as well as the body material to disperse various molecular devices in it. They also try to control the gel actuators by DNA signals coming from molecular computers.",

Titles, abstracts, and articles were reviewed to identify observational studies reporting IQ scores.\nThere were 261 unique titles, with 29 articles undergoing full review. Four articles were identified, which included 173 children with unilateral hearing loss and 202 children with normal hearing. Ages ranged from 6 to 18 years. Three studies were conducted in the United States and one in Mexico. All were of high quality. All studies reported full-scale IQ results; three reported verbal IQ results; and two reported performance IQ results. Children with unilateral hearing loss scored 6.3 points lower on full-scale IQ, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-9.1, -3.5], P value < 0.001; and 3.8 points lower on performance IQ, 95% CI [-7.3, -0.2], P value 0.04. When investigating verbal IQ, we detected substantial heterogeneity among studies; exclusion of the outlying study resulted in significant difference in verbal IQ of 4 points, 95% CI [-7.5, -0.4], P value 0.028.\nThis meta-analysis suggests children with unilateral hearing loss have lower full-scale and performance IQ scores than children with normal hearing. There also may be disparity in verbal IQ scores. Laryngoscope, 126:746-754, 2016.",

Higher trait psychopathy is associated with lower levels of emotional intelligence and increased participation in illegal behavior. Additionally, research has confirmed significantly higher levels of criminal thinking and lower levels of empathy in the incarcerated psychopathic population. However, the relationships between trait psychopathy and criminal thinking have not been researched in the community or college population. To test for such differences, questionnaires containing relevant measures were administered to 111 college students. Results indicated that higher levels of trait psychopathy were significantly related to less caring for others, intrapersonal understanding, and general mood, and greater interpersonal functioning and stress management. Furthermore, trait psychopathy was a strong predictor of violent, property, drug, and status offenses. Power-oriented criminal thinking was also predictive of violent behaviors, and entitlement predicted property offending. Results suggest emotional intelligence is important for predicting psychopathy, and trait psychopathy is a strong predictor of all types of illegal behaviors among the non-incarcerated population.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 30 years, the international conference on Artificial Intelligence in MEdicine (AIME) has been organized at different venues across Europe every 2 years, establishing a forum for scientific exchange and creating an active research community. The Artificial Intelligence in Medicine journal has published theme issues with extended versions of selected AIME papers since 1998.\nTo review the history of AIME conferences, investigate its impact on the wider research field, and identify challenges for its future.\nWe analyzed a total of 122 session titles to create a taxonomy of research themes and topics. We classified all 734 AIME conference papers published between 1985 and 2013 with this taxonomy. We also analyzed the citations to these conference papers and to 55 special issue papers.\nWe identified 30 research topics across 12 themes. AIME was dominated by knowledge engineering research in its first decade, while machine learning and data mining prevailed thereafter. Together these two themes have contributed about 51% of all papers. There have been eight AIME papers that were cited at least 10 times per year since their publication.\nThere has been a major shift from knowledge-based to data-driven methods while the interest for other research themes such as uncertainty management, image and signal processing, and natural language processing has been stable since the early 1990s. AIME papers relating to guidelines and protocols are among the most highly cited.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate trends of emotional intelligence (EI) in surgical education and to compare the incorporation of EI in surgical education to other fields of graduate medical education.\nA MEDLINE search was performed for publications containing both \"surgery\" and \"emotional intelligence\" with at least one term present in the title. Articles were included if the authors deemed EI in surgical education to be a significant focus. A separate series of MEDLINE searches were performed with the phrase \"emotional intelligence\" in any field and either \"surg*,\" \"internal medicine,\" \"pediatric,\" \"neurology,\" \"obstetric,\" \"gynecology,\" \"OBGYN,\" \"emergency,\" or \"psychiat*\" in the title. Articles were included if they discussed resident education as the primary subject. Next, a qualitative analysis of the articles was performed, with important themes from each article noted.\nLehigh Valley Health Network in Allentown, PA.\nEight articles addressed surgical resident education and satisfied inclusion criteria with 0, 1, and 7 articles published between 2001 and 2005, 2005 and 2010, and 2010 and 2015, respectively. The comparative data for articles on EI and resident education showed the following : 8 in surgery, 2 in internal medicine, 2 in pediatrics, 0 in neurology, 0 in OBGYN, 1 in emergency medicine, and 3 in psychiatry.\nIntegration of EI principles is a growing trend within surgical education. A prominent theme is quantitative assessment of EI in residents and residency applicants. Further study is warranted on the integration process of EI in surgical education and its effect on patient outcomes and long-term job satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "In this meta-analysis, we reviewed observational studies investigating differences in intelligence quotient (IQ) scores of children with unilateral hearing loss compared to children with normal hearing.\nPubMed Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, PsycINFO.\nA query identified all English-language studies related to pediatric unilateral hearing loss published between January 1980 and December 2014. Titles, abstracts, and articles were reviewed to identify observational studies reporting IQ scores.\nThere were 261 unique titles, with 29 articles undergoing full review. Four articles were identified, which included 173 children with unilateral hearing loss and 202 children with normal hearing. Ages ranged from 6 to 18 years. Three studies were conducted in the United States and one in Mexico. All were of high quality. All studies reported full-scale IQ results; three reported verbal IQ results; and two reported performance IQ results. Children with unilateral hearing loss scored 6.3 points lower on full-scale IQ, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-9.1, -3.5], P value < 0.001; and 3.8 points lower on performance IQ, 95% CI [-7.3, -0.2], P value 0.04. When investigating verbal IQ, we detected substantial heterogeneity among studies; exclusion of the outlying study resulted in significant difference in verbal IQ of 4 points, 95% CI [-7.5, -0.4], P value 0.028.\nThis meta-analysis suggests children with unilateral hearing loss have lower full-scale and performance IQ scores than children with normal hearing. There also may be disparity in verbal IQ scores. Laryngoscope, 126:746-754, 2016.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates the ostensibly paradoxical relationship that exists between the theme of excessive love, as suggested by the title of Abhishek Chaubey's film Dedh Ishqiya (2014), and the actual representation of it in the movie, which is not only restrained and disproportionate, but is also looked at with suspicion and contempt. It examines the logic of this seeming contradiction through the other two related themes that Chaubey's chef-d'\u0153uvre foregrounds, namely that of intelligence and female desire. The quest for financial autonomy that the female protagonists of the movie are involved in-a necessary pre-condition for leading independent lives-is so inextricably intertwined with manipulation, dexterity, and subterfuge, that any overt expression of homoerotic female desire can only jeopardize their existing possibilities of self-aggrandizement. The heteronormative arrangements of Begum Para's palace thus constitute the elaborate mise en sc\u00e8ne, behind which female desire is enacted through a politics of intelligence, resourcefulness, discretion, and anonymity. Through this strategic negotiation, which is also a tactical necessity, the female protagonists are not only able to con the con men in the movie, but also imagine alternative subject positions that recognize the need for both pragmatism and expediency as well as deconstructing heteropatriarchal economies of desire.",

    "abstract": "This paper is the introduction to the special issue entitled: 'Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal and technical opportunities and challenges'. Artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly permeates every aspect of our society, from the critical, like urban infrastructure, law enforcement, banking, healthcare and humanitarian aid, to the mundane like dating. AI, including embodied AI in robotics and techniques like machine learning, can improve economic, social welfare and the exercise of human rights. Owing to the proliferation of AI in high-risk areas, the pressure is mounting to design and govern AI to be accountable, fair and transparent. How can this be achieved and through which frameworks? This is one of the central questions addressed in this special issue, in which eight authors present in-depth analyses of the ethical, legal-regulatory and technical challenges posed by developing governance regimes for AI systems. It also gives a brief overview of recent developments in AI governance, how much of the agenda for defining AI regulation, ethical frameworks and technical approaches is set, as well as providing some concrete suggestions to further the debate on AI governance.This article is part of the theme issue 'Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges'.",

    "abstract": "Medical education must adapt to different health care contexts, including digitalized health care systems and a digital generation of students in a hyper-connected world. The aims of this study are to identify and synthesize the values that medical educators need to implement in the curricula and to introduce representative educational programs.\nAn integrative review was conducted to combine data from various research designs. We searched for articles on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCO ERIC between 2011 and 2017. Key search terms were \"undergraduate medical education,\" \"future,\" \"twenty-first century,\" \"millennium,\" \"curriculum,\" \"teaching,\" \"learning,\" and \"assessment.\" We screened and extracted them according to inclusion and exclusion criteria from titles and abstracts. All authors read the full texts and discussed them to reach a consensus about the themes and subthemes. Data appraisal was performed using a modified Hawker 's evaluation form.\nAmong the 7616 abstracts initially identified, 28 full-text articles were selected to reflect medical education trends and suggest suitable educational programs. The integrative themes and subthemes of future medical education are as follows: 1) a humanistic approach to patient safety that involves encouraging humanistic doctors and facilitating collaboration; 2) early experience and longitudinal integration by early exposure to patient-oriented integration and longitudinal integrated clerkships; 3) going beyond hospitals toward society by responding to changing community needs and showing respect for diversity; and 4) student-driven learning with advanced technology through active learning with individualization, social interaction, and resource accessibility.\nThis review integrated the trends in undergraduate medical education in readiness for the anticipated changes in medical environments. The detailed programs introduced in this study could be useful for medical educators in the development of curricula. Further research is required to integrate the educational trends into graduate and continuing medical education, and to investigate the status or effects of innovative educational programs in each medical school or environment.",

    "abstract": "Systematic reviews are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine. However, systematic reviews are time consuming and there is growing demand to produce evidence more quickly, while maintaining robust methods. In recent years, artificial intelligence and active-machine learning (AML) have been implemented into several SR software applications. As some of the barriers to adoption of new technologies are the challenges in set-up and how best to use these technologies, we have provided different situations and considerations for knowledge synthesis teams to consider when using artificial intelligence and AML for title and abstract screening.\nWe retrospectively evaluated the implementation and performance of AML across a set of ten historically completed systematic reviews. Based upon the findings from this work and in consideration of the barriers we have encountered and navigated during the past 24\u2009months in using these tools prospectively in our research, we discussed and developed a series of practical recommendations for research teams to consider in seeking to implement AML tools for citation screening into their workflow.\nWe developed a seven-step framework and provide guidance for when and how to integrate artificial intelligence and AML into the title and abstract screening process. Steps include: (1) Consulting with Knowledge user/Expert Panel; (2) Developing the search strategy; (3) Preparing your review team; (4) Preparing your database; (5) Building the initial training set; (6) Ongoing screening; and (7) Truncating screening. During Step 6 and/or 7, you may also choose to optimize your team, by shifting some members to other review stages (e.g., full-text screening, data extraction).\nArtificial intelligence and, more specifically, AML are well-developed tools for title and abstract screening and can be integrated into the screening process in several ways. Regardless of the method chosen, transparent reporting of these methods is critical for future studies evaluating artificial intelligence and AML.",

Therefore, this meta-analysis tested the hypothesis that artificial intelligence system is accurate in distinguishing benign and malignant breast diseases.\nWe will search PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Chinese biomedical databases from their inceptions to the November 20, 2021, without language restrictions. Two authors will independently carry out searching literature records, scanning titles and abstracts, full texts, collecting data, and assessing risk of bias. Review Manager 5.2 and Stata14.0 software will be used for data analysis.\nThis systematic review will determine the accuracy of AI in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant breast diseases.\nIts findings will provide helpful evidence for the accuracy of AI in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant breast diseases.\nINPLASY2021110087.",

    "abstract": "As the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care increases, it will become increasingly crucial to involve health care professionals (HCPs) in developing, validating, and implementing AI-enabled technologies. However, because of a lack of AI literacy, most HCPs are not adequately prepared for this revolution. This is a significant barrier to adopting and implementing AI that will affect patients. In addition, the limited existing AI education programs face barriers to development and implementation at various levels of medical education.\nWith a view to informing future AI education programs for HCPs, this scoping review aims to provide an overview of the types of current or past AI education programs that pertains to the programs' curricular content, modes of delivery, critical implementation factors for education delivery, and outcomes used to assess the programs' effectiveness.\nAfter the creation of a search strategy and keyword searches, a 2-stage screening process was conducted by 2 independent reviewers to determine study eligibility. When consensus was not reached, the conflict was resolved by consulting a third reviewer. This process consisted of a title and abstract scan and a full-text review. The articles were included if they discussed an actual training program or educational intervention, or a potential training program or educational intervention and the desired content to be covered, focused on AI, and were designed or intended for HCPs (at any stage of their career).\nOf the 10,094 unique citations scanned, 41 (0.41%) studies relevant to our eligibility criteria were identified. Among the 41 included studies, 10 (24%) described 13 unique programs and 31 (76%) discussed recommended curricular content. The curricular content of the unique programs ranged from AI use, AI interpretation, and cultivating skills to explain results derived from AI algorithms. The curricular topics were categorized into three main domains: cognitive, psychomotor, and affective.\nThis review provides an overview of the current landscape of AI in medical education and highlights the skills and competencies required by HCPs to effectively use AI in enhancing the quality of care and optimizing patient outcomes. Future education efforts should focus on the development of regulatory strategies, a multidisciplinary approach to curriculum redesign, a competency-based curriculum, and patient-clinician interaction.",

    "abstract": "Optimal outcomes after large-vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke are highly dependent on prompt diagnosis, effective communication, and treatment, making LVO an attractive avenue for the application of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning (ML). Our objective is to conduct a systematic review to describe existing AI applications for LVO strokes, delineate its effectiveness, and identify areas for future AI applications in stroke treatment and prognostication.\nA systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. After deduplication, studies were screened by title and abstract. Full-text studies were screened for final inclusion based on prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Relevant data were extracted from each study.\nOf 11,512 resultant articles, 40 were included. Of 30 studies with reported ML algorithms, the most commonly used ML algorithms were convolutional neural networks in 10 (33.3%), support vector machines in 10 (33.0%), and random forests in 9 (30.0%). Studies examining triage favored direct transport to a stroke center and predicted improved outcomes. ML techniques proved vastly accurate in identifying LVO on computed tomography. Applications of AI to patient selection for thrombectomy are lacking, although some studies determine individual patient eligibility for endovascular treatment with high accuracy. ML algorithms have reasonable accuracy in predicting clinical and angiographic outcomes and associated factors.\nAI has shown promise in the diagnosis and triage of patients with acute stroke. However, the role of AI in the management and prognostication remains limited and warrants further research to help in decision support.",

Compassion is essential for high-quality healthcare and research shows how prosocial caring behaviors benefit human health and societies. However, the possible association between AI technologies and compassion is under conceptualized and underexplored.\nThe aim of this scoping review is to provide a comprehensive depth and a balanced perspective of the emerging topic of AI technologies and compassion, to inform future research and practice. The review questions were: How is compassion discussed in relation to AI technologies in healthcare? How are AI technologies being used to enhance compassion in healthcare? What are the gaps in current knowledge and unexplored potential? What are the key areas where AI technologies could support compassion in healthcare?\nA systematic scoping review following five steps of Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Presentation of the scoping review conforms with PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). Eligibility criteria were defined according to 3 concept constructs (AI technologies, compassion, healthcare) developed from the literature and informed by medical subject headings (MeSH) and key words for the electronic searches. Sources of evidence were Web of Science and PubMed databases, articles published in English language 2011-2022. Articles were screened by title/abstract using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data extracted (author, date of publication, type of article, aim/context of healthcare, key relevant findings, country) was charted using data tables. Thematic analysis used an inductive-deductive approach to generate code categories from the review questions and the data. A multidisciplinary team assessed themes for resonance and relevance to research and practice.\nSearches identified 3,124 articles. A total of 197 were included after screening. The number of articles has increased over 10 years (2011, \nThere is an association between AI technologies and compassion in healthcare and interest in this association has grown internationally over the last decade. In a range of healthcare contexts, AI technologies are being used to enhance empathetic awareness; empathetic response and relational behavior; communication skills; health coaching; therapeutic interventions; moral development learning; clinical knowledge and clinical assessment; healthcare quality assessment; therapeutic bond and therapeutic alliance; and to provide health information and advice. The findings inform a reconceptualization of compassion as a \nIn a complex adaptive system such as healthcare, human-AI intelligent caring will need to be implemented, not as an ideology, but through strategic choices, incentives, regulation, professional education, and training, as well as through joined up thinking about human-AI intelligent caring. Research funders can encourage research and development into the topic of AI technologies and compassion as a system of human-AI intelligent caring.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the principal cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection of lung cancer with screening is indispensable to reduce the high morbidity and mortality rates. Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely utilised in healthcare, including in the assessment of medical images. A growing number of reviews studied the application of AI in lung cancer screening, but no overarching meta-analysis has examined the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of AI-based imaging for lung cancer screening.\nTo systematically review the DTA of AI-based imaging for lung cancer screening.\nPubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses were searched from inception to date. Studies that were published in English and that evaluated the performance of AI-based imaging for lung cancer screening were included. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts and used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool to appraise the quality of selected studies. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation to diagnostic tests was used to assess the certainty of evidence.\nTwenty-six studies with 150,721 imaging data were included. Hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic model used for meta-analysis demonstrated that the pooled sensitivity for AI-based imaging for lung cancer screening was 94.6\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 91.4\u00a0% to 96.7\u00a0%) and specificity was 93.6\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 88.5\u00a0% to 96.6\u00a0%). Subgroup analyses revealed that similar results were found among different types of AI, region, data source, and year of publication, but the overall quality of evidence was very low.\nAI-based imaging could effectively detect lung cancer and be incorporated into lung cancer screening programs. Further high-quality DTA studies on large lung cancer screening populations are required to validate AI's role in early lung cancer detection.",

PD affects the voice, including changes in pitch, intensity, articulation, and syllable rate.We aimed to study the current status of artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning algorithms (MLAs) in the assessment of speech abnormalities in PD along with the generation of intelligible synthetic speech for voice rehabilitation. We searched the literature for studies focusing on speech/voice disorder in PD and rehabilitation techniques till June 18, 2022. We searched PubMed and Engineering Village (Compendex and Inspec combined) databases. After careful screening of the title and evaluation of abstracts, we used select articles describing the use of AI or its various forms in the management of speech abnormalities in PD to synthesize this review. MLAs classify PD and non-PD patients with an accuracy of more than 90% using only voice features. Non-acoustic sensors can rehabilitate PD patient by converting dysarthric speech to highly intelligible speech using MLAs. MLAs can automatically assess several speech features and quantify the progression of speech abnormalities in PD. PD speech rehabilitation using MLAs may prove superior to other available therapies.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has permeated into every aspect of medicine and promises to provide accurate diagnosis, better management decision and improved outcome for patients and healthcare system. However, ethical, social and legal issues need to be resolved for successful implementation of AI tools in clinical practice. In order to gain trust and acceptance, AI algorithms should offer maximum explainability and inclusiveness. Robust evidence of benefit to patients and healthcare services has to be provided to gain justification of using these tools. Doctor-patient relationship needs to be maintained in order to gain trust and acceptance of users. Autonomy of decisions and dignity of patients need to be preserved while using machine in healthcare. Responsibility and accountability in the use of AI in medicine should be deliberated and defined before mishaps and damage occur. A new role of healthcare providers will emerge with the advancement of technology and changes are inevitable.

    "abstract": "To construct a non-invasive pre-hospital screening model and early based on artificial intelligence algorithms to provide the severity of stroke in patients, provide screening, guidance and early warning for stroke patients and their families, and provide data support for clinical decision-making.\nA retrospective study was conducted. The clinical information of stroke patients (n = 53 793) were extracted from the Yidu cloud big data server system of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University from January 1, 2001 to July 31, 2023. Combined with the results of single factor screening and the opinions of experts with senior professional titles in neurology, the input variable was determined, and the output variable was the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) representing the severity of the disease at admission. Python 3.7 was used to build DeepFM algorithm model, and five data mining models including Logistic regression, CART decision tree, C5.0 decision tree, Bayesian network and deep neural network (DNN) were built at the same time. The original data were randomly divided into 80% training set and 20% test set, which were used to train and test the models, adjust the parameters of each model, respectively calculate the accuracy, sensitivity and F-index of the six models, carry out the comprehensive comparison and evaluation of the model. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) and calibration curve were drawn, compared the prediction performance of DeepFM model and the other five algorithms. In addition, the data of stroke patients (n = 1 028) were extracted from Dalian Central Hospital for external verification of the model.\nA total of 14 015 stroke patients with complete information were selected, including 11 212 in the training set and 2 803 in the testing set. After univariate screening, 14 indicators were included to construct the model, including gender, age, recurrence, physical impairment, facial problems, speech disorders, head reactions, disturbance of consciousness, visual disorders, abnormal cough and swallowing, high risk factor, family history, smoking history and drinking history. DeepFM model adopted the two-order crossover feature. The number of hidden layers in DNN layer was 3. Dropout was used to discard the neurons in the neural network. Rule was used as the activation function. Each layer used Dense full connection. The objective function was random gradient descent. The number of iterations was 15. There were 133 922 training parameters in total. Comparing the predictive value of the six models showed that the accuracy of DeepFM model was 0.951, the sensitivity was 0.992, the specificity was 0.814, the F-index was 0.950, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.916. The accuracy of the other five data mining models was between 0.771-0.780, the sensitivity was between 0.978-0.987, the F-index was between 0.690-0.707, and the AUC was between 0.568-0.639. The calibration curve of the DeepFM model was more aligned with the ideal curve than the other five data mining models. Suggesting that the prediction performance of DeepFM model was the best. External validation was conducted on the DeepFM model, and its accuracy was 0.891, indicating good generalization performance of the model.\nThe pre-hospital non-invasive screening prediction model based on DeepFM can accurately predict the severity grading of stroke patients, and has potential application value in rapid screening and early clinical decision-making of stroke.",

In recent years, the primary sectors of modern medicine have turned to digital health innovations to enhance patient care development. The main objective of this review is to document advancements in digital health within the IUSMM and its affiliated research center over the past 150 years. Method An integrative review focusing on digital health innovations at the IUSMM was conducted. The Medline, Web of Science, PsycNet (PsycINFO), and Google Scholar databases were consulted from their inception until December 2023. Result The literature review initially identified 239 articles, with 108 duplicates removed during the preliminary analysis. Among the remaining 131 studies, 63 articles were excluded based on title and abstract review, as they did not meet inclusion criteria. After a comprehensive analysis of the initially selected 68 articles for eligibility evaluation, a total of 22 articles were retained. Five categories of articles were identified: virtual reality, digital applications, remote services and therapies, the use of artificial intelligence, and digital personal assistants. Conclusion On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the IUSMM, this integrative review reveals that digital health innovations are primarily concentrated in the last decade, suggesting promising potential for digital applications in supporting individuals with mental health disorders, although the transition to clinical practice may progress slowly.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) predictive models in primary health care have the potential to enhance population health by rapidly and accurately identifying individuals who should receive care and health services. However, these models also carry the risk of perpetuating or amplifying existing biases toward diverse groups. We identified a gap in the current understanding of strategies used to assess and mitigate bias in primary health care algorithms related to individuals' personal or protected attributes.\nThis study aimed to describe the attempts, strategies, and methods used to mitigate bias in AI models within primary health care, to identify the diverse groups or protected attributes considered, and to evaluate the results of these approaches on both bias reduction and AI model performance.\nWe conducted a scoping review following Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines, searching Medline (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (Ovid), and Web of Science databases for studies published between January 1, 2017, and November 15, 2022. Pairs of reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, applied selection criteria, and performed full-text screening. Discrepancies regarding study inclusion were resolved by consensus. Following reporting standards for AI in health care, we extracted data on study objectives, model features, targeted diverse groups, mitigation strategies used, and results. Using the mixed methods appraisal tool, we appraised the quality of the studies.\nAfter removing 585 duplicates, we screened 1018 titles and abstracts. From the remaining 189 full-text articles, we included 17 studies. The most frequently investigated protected attributes were race (or ethnicity), examined in 12 of the 17 studies, and sex (often identified as gender), typically classified as \"male versus female\" in 10 of the studies. We categorized bias mitigation approaches into four clusters: (1) modifying existing AI models or datasets, (2) sourcing data from electronic health records, (3) developing tools with a \"human-in-the-loop\" approach, and (4) identifying ethical principles for informed decision-making. Algorithmic preprocessing methods, such as relabeling and reweighing data, along with natural language processing techniques that extract data from unstructured notes, showed the greatest potential for bias mitigation. Other methods aimed at enhancing model fairness included group recalibration and the application of the equalized odds metric. However, these approaches sometimes exacerbated prediction errors across groups or led to overall model miscalibrations.\nThe results suggest that biases toward diverse groups are more easily mitigated when data are open-sourced, multiple stakeholders are engaged, and during the algorithm's preprocessing stage. Further empirical studies that include a broader range of groups, such as Indigenous peoples in Canada, are needed to validate and expand upon these findings.\nOSF Registry osf.io/9ngz5/; https://osf.io/9ngz5/.\nRR2-10.2196/46684.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) predictive models in primary health care have the potential to enhance population health by rapidly and accurately identifying individuals who should receive care and health services. However, these models also carry the risk of perpetuating or amplifying existing biases toward diverse groups. We identified a gap in the current understanding of strategies used to assess and mitigate bias in primary health care algorithms related to individuals' personal or protected attributes.\nThis study aimed to describe the attempts, strategies, and methods used to mitigate bias in AI models within primary health care, to identify the diverse groups or protected attributes considered, and to evaluate the results of these approaches on both bias reduction and AI model performance.\nWe conducted a scoping review following Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines, searching Medline (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (Ovid), and Web of Science databases for studies published between January 1, 2017, and November 15, 2022. Pairs of reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, applied selection criteria, and performed full-text screening. Discrepancies regarding study inclusion were resolved by consensus. Following reporting standards for AI in health care, we extracted data on study objectives, model features, targeted diverse groups, mitigation strategies used, and results. Using the mixed methods appraisal tool, we appraised the quality of the studies.\nAfter removing 585 duplicates, we screened 1018 titles and abstracts. From the remaining 189 full-text articles, we included 17 studies. The most frequently investigated protected attributes were race (or ethnicity), examined in 12 of the 17 studies, and sex (often identified as gender), typically classified as \"male versus female\" in 10 of the studies. We categorized bias mitigation approaches into four clusters: (1) modifying existing AI models or datasets, (2) sourcing data from electronic health records, (3) developing tools with a \"human-in-the-loop\" approach, and (4) identifying ethical principles for informed decision-making. Algorithmic preprocessing methods, such as relabeling and reweighing data, along with natural language processing techniques that extract data from unstructured notes, showed the greatest potential for bias mitigation. Other methods aimed at enhancing model fairness included group recalibration and the application of the equalized odds metric. However, these approaches sometimes exacerbated prediction errors across groups or led to overall model miscalibrations.\nThe results suggest that biases toward diverse groups are more easily mitigated when data are open-sourced, multiple stakeholders are engaged, and during the algorithm's preprocessing stage. Further empirical studies that include a broader range of groups, such as Indigenous peoples in Canada, are needed to validate and expand upon these findings.\nOSF Registry osf.io/9ngz5/; https://osf.io/9ngz5/.\nRR2-10.2196/46684.",

This review aims to systematically present the state of the art in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications for the diagnosis, classification, and treatment planning of vascular anomalies affecting the soft tissues of the head and neck region.\nThe PubMed research identified 86 articles. After the initial screening of titles and abstracts, 75 studies were excluded due to the following reasons: irrelevance to the review's scope, unsuitable patient population, or inappropriate study design. 11 pertinent papers were included for the full-text screening. At the end of the full-text evaluation, 3 studies were considered eligible to be revised.\nConcerning the clinical, radiological, and histological diagnosis of vascular malformations, the three models reviewed seem to be promising in the classification of the different subtypes and the lesion's segmentation. The applications of AI achieved in the fields of radiology and dermatology are very promising. Any study did not provide a prospective validation cohort to verify the diagnostic performance but also to assess the usefulness of the model in clinical practice.\nWe can also affirm that a hybrid model, combining dermatological images, MRI or US images, and histological images, can be developed as a reliable AI tool, useful for clinicians from diagnosis to treatment decision-making and to supervise interventional procedures.",

    "abstract": "The bi-annual international congress on autoimmunity is a huge opportunity for the medical community to discuss the latest updates in the field. During the 14th congress 2024 (AUTO14) in Ljubljana, artificial intelligence (AI) occupied special attention due to its recent and ongoing unequivocal role in various medical fields including autoimmunity. For instance, through a challenging debate between world-experts and the most popular AI bot used (ChatGPT), several clinical cases including a case of vasculitis were discussed in the plenary sessions. ChatGPT agreed with the clinical decisions made by the experts nevertheless, the bot added additional aspects related to the specific case. In this regard, ChatGPT emphasized the need for osteoporosis prophylaxis in a patient planned to be treated with systemic steroids for a long time. Furthermore, AUTO14 included the newest updates on most autoimmune disorders, distributed among tens of sessions. Among others, infection and autoimmunity, the sequalae of the pandemic of COVID-19, as well as COVID-19 vaccines were discussed as well. Due to the high numbers of the works presented, and for ensuring that important updates are not missed; we divided our paper into sections. The subtitles throughout the paper correspond to different sessions of the congress, all presenting new updates in the field. A figure aiding in navigating throughout the paper was also provided.",
